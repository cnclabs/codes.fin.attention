table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item of this report 
introduction we are in the business of managing regulated waste and providing an array of related services 
we operate in the united states  argentina  brazil  canada  chile  ireland  japan  mexico  portugal  romania  spain  and the united kingdom 
for large quantity generators of regulated waste such as hospitals and for pharmaceutical companies and distributors  we offer our institutional regulated waste management services  our bio systems reusable sharps management services to reduce the risk of needle sticks  a variety of products and services for infection control  our regulated recall and returns management services for expired or recalled products  pharmaceutical waste disposal services  hazardous waste disposal  and our patient communication services 
for small quantity generators of regulated waste such as doctors offices and for retail pharmacies  we offer our medical and regulated waste management services  our steri safe osha and hipaa compliance programs  a variety of products and services for infection control  our regulated recall and returns management services for expired or recalled products  and our patient communication services 
we operate integrated national regulated waste management networks domestically and internationally 
our national networks include a total of processing or combined processing and collection sites and additional transfer  collection or combined transfer and collection sites 
our regulated waste processing technologies include autoclaving  our proprietary etd  chemical treatment  and incineration 
we serve approximately  customers worldwide  of which approximately  are large quantity generators and approximately  are small quantity generators 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies see note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements  the following ones may involve a higher degree of judgment on our part and greater complexity of reporting 
revenue recognition revenues for our regulated waste management services  other than our steri safe service  are recognized at the time of waste collection 
our steri safe revenues are recognized evenly over the contractual service period 
payments received in advance are deferred and recognized as services are provided 
revenues from regulated recall and returns management services and patient communication services are recorded at the time services are performed 
revenues from product sales are recognized at the time the goods are shipped to the customer 
charges related to international value added tax vat and other similar pass through taxes are not included as revenue 
goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets goodwill associated with the excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired is not amortized 
we have determined that our permits have indefinite lives and  accordingly  are not amortized see note goodwill and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
our balance sheet at december  contains goodwill of billion 
in accordance with applicable accounting standards  we evaluate on at least an annual basis  using the fair value of reporting units  whether 
table of contents goodwill is impaired 
if we were to determine that a significant impairment has occurred  we would be required to incur non cash charges of the impaired portion of goodwill that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the impairment charge occurs 
during the quarter ended june   we performed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation for our three reporting units  domestic regulated waste management services  domestic regulated recall and returns management services  and international 
we calculate the fair value of our reporting units using an income method and validate those results using a market approach 
both the income and market approaches indicated no impairment to goodwill to any of our three reporting units 
income approach the income approach uses expected future cash flows of each reporting unit and discounts those cash flows to a present value 
expected future cash flows are calculated using management assumptions of internal growth  capital expenditures  and cost efficiencies 
future acquisitions are not included in the expected future cash flows 
we use a discount rate based on our company calculated weighted average cost of capital which is adjusted for each of our reporting units based on risk size premium and foreign country premium 
significant assumptions used in the income approach include realization of future cash flows and the discount rate used to present value those cash flows 
the results of our goodwill impairment test using the income approach indicated the fair value of our reporting units exceeded book value by a substantial amount  in excess of 
market approach our market approach begins by calculating the market capitalization of the company using the average stock price for the prior days and the outstanding share count at june  we then look at the company s earnings before interest  tax  depreciation  and amortization ebitda  adjusted for stock compensation expense and other items  such as a gain or loss on the sale of divested assets  for the prior twelve months 
the calculated market capitalization is divided by the modified ebitda to arrive at a valuation multiple 
the fair value of each reporting unit is then calculated by taking the product of the valuation multiple and the trailing twelve month modified ebitda of that reporting unit 
the fair value was then compared to the reporting units book value and determined to be in excess of the book value 
we believe that starting with the fair value of the company as a whole is a reasonable measure as that fair value is then allocated to each reporting unit based on that reporting unit s individual earnings 
a sustained drop in our stock price would have a negative impact to our fair value calculations 
a temporary drop in earnings of a reporting unit would have a negative impact to our fair value calculations 
the results of our goodwill impairment test using the market approach indicated the fair value of our reporting units exceeded book value by a substantial amount  in excess of of book value 
our permits are tested for impairment annually at december or more frequently if circumstances indicate that they may be impaired 
we use either a discounted income or cost savings model as the current measurement of the fair value of the permits 
the fair value is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance  internal and external processing costs  and an appropriate discount rate determined by management 
our estimates of discounted income may differ from actual income due to  among other things  inaccuracies in economic estimates 
in  we wrote off million for the permit intangibles of two facilities due to rationalizing our operations 
under current acquisition accounting  a fair value must be assigned to all acquired assets based on a theoretical market participant regardless of the acquirers intended use for those assets 
this accounting treatment can lead to the recognition of losses if a company disposes of acquired assets 
other identifiable intangible assets  such as customer relationships  tradenames  and covenants not to compete  are currently amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
we have 
table of contents determined that our regulated waste customer relationships have between year and year lives based on the specific type of relationship 
although the contracted regulated waste management business is highly competitive  we have been able to maintain high customer retention through excellent customer service 
the valuation of our contractual customer relationships was derived using a discounted income approach valuation model 
these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may be more than its undiscounted estimated future cash flows 
there have been no indicators of impairment of these intangibles see note goodwill and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements 
share repurchases the purchase price over par value for share repurchases is allocated to retained earnings 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
we compute our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled 
significant judgments are required in order to determine the realizability of these deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we evaluate all significant available positive and negative evidence  including historical operating results  estimates of future taxable income and the existence of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
changes in the expectations regarding the realization of deferred tax assets could materially impact income tax expense in future periods 
to provide for uncertain tax positions  we maintain a reserve for tax benefits assumed that do not meet a threshold of more likely than not to be sustained 
management believes the amount provided for uncertain tax positions is adequate 
at december   net operating loss carry forwards for us federal and state income tax purposes have been fully utilized  excluding net operating loss carry forwards related to our acquisitions 
the net operating loss carry forwards from foreign and domestic acquisitions are approximately million and certain of these net operating loss carry forwards begin to expire in of these  million have a valuation allowance offsetting the benefit 
the valuation allowance primarily represents loss carry forwards for which limitations are in place and utilization before their expiration is uncertain 
changes in our valuation allowance during were primarily related to adjustments to acquisition accounting 
accounts receivable accounts receivable consists of amounts due to us from our normal business activities and are carried at their estimated collectible amounts 
our accounts receivable balance includes amounts related to vat and similar international pass through taxes 
accounts receivable balances are determined to be delinquent when the amount is past due based on the contractual terms with the customer 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected uncollectibility of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified among uncollected accounts 
accounts receivable are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts when we have determined that the receivable will not be collected 
no single customer accounts for more than of our accounts receivable 
insurance our insurance for workers compensation  vehicle liability and physical damage  and employee related health care benefits is obtained using high deductible insurance policies 
a third party administrator is used to process all such claims 
we require all workers compensation  vehicle liability and physical damage claims to be reported within hours 
as a result  we accrue our workers compensation  vehicle and physical damage liability based upon the claim reserves established by the third party administrator at the end of each reporting period 
our employee health insurance benefit liability is based on our historical claims experience rate 
our earnings would be impacted to the extent that actual claims vary from historical experience 
we review our accruals associated with the exposure to these liabilities for adequacy at the end of each reporting period 

table of contents litigation we operate in a highly regulated industry and deal with regulatory inquiries or investigations from time to time that may be instituted for a variety of reasons 
we are also involved in a variety of civil litigation from time to time 
settlements from litigation are recorded when known  probable and estimable 
stock option plans we have issued stock options to employees and directors as an integral part of our compensation programs 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment  including estimating expected volatility of our stock  expected term of the award  and the risk free rate 
our stock s expected volatility is based upon historical experience 
the expected term of the awards is based upon historical experience 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon the us treasury yield rates of a comparable period 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
new accounting pronouncements for information about recently issued accounting pronouncements see note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements 
fair value considerations financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment  and may affect the valuation of assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels 
the impact of our creditworthiness has been considered in the fair value measurements noted below 
in addition  the fair value measurement of a liability must reflect the nonperformance risk of an entity 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million of short term investments that we recorded at fair value using level inputs and million of contingent consideration related to acquisitions that we recorded at fair value using level inputs 
at december   we had no derivative instruments 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  highlights for the year ended december  included the following revenues grew to billion  a increase over billion in gross margins decreased to in from in  operating income was million  a increase from million for  we incurred million in pre tax expenses related to acquisitions  litigation settlement  restructuring and plant closure costs  loss on sale of business  and changes in fair value of contingent consideration  we incurred million in integration expenses related to acquisitions  cash flow from operations was million 
in analyzing our company s performance  it is necessary to understand that our various regulated waste services share a common infrastructure and customer base 
we market our regulated waste services by offering various pricing options to meet our customers preferences  and customers move between these different billing paradigms 
for example  our regulated waste customers may contract with us for medical waste disposal services that are billed based on the weight of waste collected  processed and disposed during a particular period and  in a subsequent period  the same customer could move to our standard service steri safe osha compliance program  which packages the same regulated waste services with some training and education services for a contracted subscription fee 
another example is a customer that purchases our medical waste disposal and sharps disposal management services which provides the customer with the same regulated 
table of contents waste services under a different pricing and billing arrangement 
we do not track the movement of customers between the various types of regulated waste services we offer 
although we can identify directional trends in our services  because the regulated waste services are similar in nature and there are inherent inaccuracies in disaggregation  we believe that aggregating these revenues communicates the appropriate metric 
we analyze our revenue growth by identifying changes related to internal growth  acquired growth  and changes due to currency exchange fluctuations
