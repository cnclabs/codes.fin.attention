item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global provider of medical technology products that enhance clinical benefits  improve patient and provider safety and reduce total procedural costs 
we primarily design  develop  manufacture and supply single use medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications 
we sell our products to hospitals and healthcare providers in more than countries through a combination of our direct sales force and distributors 
because our products are used in numerous markets and for a variety of procedures  we are not dependent upon any one end market or procedure 
we categorize our products into four groups critical care  surgical care  cardiac care and original equipment manufacturer and development services oem 
critical care  representing our largest product group  includes medical devices used in vascular access  anesthesia  urology and respiratory care applications  surgical care includes surgical instruments and devices  and cardiac care includes cardiac assist devices and equipment 
oem designs and manufactures instruments and devices for other medical device manufacturers 
over the past several years we have evolved into a pure play medical technology company 
through an extensive acquisition and divestiture program  we significantly changed the composition of our portfolio of businesses  expanding our presence in the medical technology industry  while divesting all of our businesses serving the aerospace and commercial markets 
the following is a listing of our more significant acquisitions and divestitures that have occurred since with respect to divested businesses listed below  we have reported results of operations  cash flows and gains losses on the disposition of these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented

change in reporting segments and business unit structure effective january   we changed our segment reporting from a single reportable segment to four reportable segments  three of which are geographically based 
as initially changed  the three geographic segments were north america  emea representing our operations in europe  the middle east and africa and ajla representing our asian and latin american operations 
the fourth reportable segment is comprised of our oem business 
in addition  in the first quarter of  we changed the number of our reporting units 
in  we had six reporting units comprised of north america  emea  oem  japan  asia pacific and latin america 
in  in addition to establishing a new north america segment  we established five reporting units in that segment vascular  anesthesia respiratory  cardiac  surgical and specialty 
due to the change in the reporting unit structure in north america  we were required to conduct a goodwill impairment test with respect to each of the north american reporting units in the first quarter of  and determined that the goodwill of three of the reporting units vascular  anesthesia respiratory and cardiac was impaired 
as a result  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in the first quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of the goodwill impairment 
the impairment charge does not reflect any significant business change or any change in our expectations regarding the future operating results or liquidity of the north american segment 
rather  it is attributable to the creation of five new reporting units out of the north american reporting unit 
in 
table of contents the fourth quarter of  we determined the fair value of the north american reporting unit exceeded its carrying value  and thus there was no further analysis to determine if there was an impairment of goodwill 
in the first quarter of  we determined the relative fair values of each reporting unit and allocated the goodwill assigned to the north american reporting unit to each of the new reporting units based on relative fair value 
we subsequently allocated all assets and liabilities other than goodwill to the reporting unit based on specific identification and the reporting unit s respective operating activities 
the resulting allocation of the carrying amounts was different from the allocation of the relative fair value 
accordingly  while there was very little change between the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of in the total fair value and carrying value of the sum of the five reporting units compared to the north american reporting unit  the relative values were different for each of the five new reporting units 
for some reporting units the fair value exceeded the carrying value  and in other situations the carrying value exceeded fair value of the reporting unit  which resulted in further analysis to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill and the resulting impairment charge 
this charge was primarily attributable to the fact that the fair value of assets other than goodwill increased which results in a decrease in the assumed fair value of goodwill 
in the third quarter of  due to changes in our management and internal reporting structure  our latin america operations were moved from the ajla segment into the north america segment 
as a result of this change  the north america segment is now referred to as the americas segment and the ajla segment is now referred to as the asia segment 
the change did not affect our reporting unit structure 
segment disclosures for all prior comparative periods have been restated to reflect this change 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of the segments 
health care reform on march  the patient protection and affordable care act was signed into law 
this legislation will have a significant impact on our business 
for medical device companies such as teleflex  the expansion of medical insurance coverage should lead to greater utilization of the products we manufacture  but this legislation also contains provisions designed to contain the cost of healthcare  which could negatively affect pricing of our products 
in addition  commencing in  the legislation imposes a excise tax on sales of medical devices 
as implementation of this tax begins and as the taxing authorities clarify aspects of the application of the tax relevant to us  we will be in a better position to ascertain its impact on our business 
we currently estimate the impact of the medical device excise tax will be approximately million annually  beginning in global economic conditions global economic conditions have had adverse impacts on market activities including  among other things  failure of financial institutions  falling asset values  diminished liquidity  and reduced demand for products and services 
in response  we adjusted production levels and engaged in new restructuring activities and we continue to review and evaluate our manufacturing  warehousing and distribution processes to maximize efficiencies through the elimination of redundancies and the consolidation of facilities 
although  on a consolidated basis  the economic conditions did not have a significant adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity  healthcare policies and practice trends vary by country  and the impact of the global economic downturn was felt to varying degrees in each of our regional markets over the last three years  the continuation of the present broad economic trends of weak economic growth  constricted credit and public sector austerity measures in response to growing public budget deficits could adversely affect our operations in the future  as described below 
the potential effect of these factors on our current and future liquidity is discussed below 
hospitals in some regions of the united states experienced a decline in admissions  a weaker payor mix  and a reduction in elective procedures 
hospitals consequently took actions to reduce their costs  including limiting their capital spending 
distributors in the supply chain reduced inventory levels 
table of contents and generally have not replenished inventories to pre recession levels 
the impact of these actions is most pronounced in capital goods markets  which affected our surgical instrument and cardiac assist businesses 
more recently  the economic environment has improved somewhat  but has not returned to pre recession levels  and challenges persist  particularly in some european countries  as discussed below 
approximately percent of our net revenues come from single use products used in critical care and surgical applications  and our sales volume could be negatively impacted if hospital admission rates or payor mix decline further as a result of continuing high unemployment rates and subsequent loss of insurance coverage by consumers 
in europe  some countries have taken austerity measures due to the current economic climate 
elective surgeries have been delayed and hospital budgets have been reduced 
in certain countries mainly germany we have seen changes in the local reimbursement to home care patients and pricing impacts on business awarded through the tendering process 
these markets have introduced more buying groups and group purchasing organizations  or gpos  resulting in reductions in commodity product pricing 
it is possible that funding for publically funded healthcare institutions could be affected in the future as governments make further spending adjustments and enact healthcare reform measures to lower overall healthcare costs 
the public healthcare systems in certain countries in western europe  most notably greece  spain  portugal and italy  have experienced significantly reduced liquidity due to recessionary conditions  which has resulted in a slowdown in payments to us 
we believe this situation will continue and may worsen unless and until these countries are able to find alternative means of funding their respective public healthcare sectors 
in asia  recovery from the global recession has varied by country 
china has announced plans for major healthcare investment targeted at second tier cities and hospitals  which may provide future growth opportunities for us  while slow economic growth and continued pursuit of reimbursement cuts by the public hospital sector in japan is expected to limit growth in that market 
results of operations the following comparisons exclude the impact of the operations of the orthopedic and ssi businesses and businesses in our former commercial and aerospace segments  which have been presented in our consolidated financial results as discontinued operations see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k and discontinued operations in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for discussion of discontinued operations 
discussion of constant currency excludes the impact of translating the results of international subsidiaries at different currency exchange rates from year to year 
certain financial information is presented on a rounded basis  which may cause minor differences 
revenues information regarding net revenues by product group is provided in the following table year ended december increase decrease vs vs dollars in millions critical care surgical care cardiac care oem and development services other net revenues 
table of contents the following table presents the percentage increases or decreases in product group net revenues during the years ended december  and compared to the respective prior years on a constant currency basis  the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on those revenues and the total increase or decrease in net revenues for the periods presented taking into account the impact of foreign currency fluctuations as defined in note below increase decrease vs vs constant currency currency impact total change constant currency currency impact total change critical care surgical care cardiac care oem and development services other total change constant currency is a non gaap financial measure that measures the change in net revenues between current and prior year periods by excluding the impact of translating the results of international subsidiaries at different currency exchange rates from period to period 
the constant currency increase decrease percentage is calculated by translating the prior year period s local currency net revenues into an amount reflecting the current year period s foreign currency exchange rates and calculating the percentage difference between net revenues for the current year period and net revenues for the prior year period  as so translated 
management believes this measure is useful to investors because it eliminates items that do not reflect our day to day operations 
in addition  management uses this financial measure for internal managerial purposes  when publicly providing guidance on possible future results  and to assist in our evaluation of period to period comparisons 
this financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies  is presented in addition to results presented in accordance with gaap and should not be relied upon as a substitute for gaap financial measures

liquidity and capital resources we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating  investing and financing activities 
our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows 
in addition to operating cash flows  other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include capital expenditures  acquisitions  pension funding  dividends  adequacy of available bank lines of credit  and access to capital markets 
we currently do not foresee any difficulties in meeting our cash requirements or accessing credit as needed in the next twelve months 
to date  we have not experienced an inordinate amount of payment defaults by our customers  and we have sufficient lending commitments in place to enable us to fund our anticipated additional operating needs 
however  as discussed above in global economic conditions  the ongoing volatility in the domestic and global financial markets  including the european sovereign debt crisis  combined with a continuation of constrained global credit markets there is a risk that our customers and suppliers may be unable to access liquidity 
consequently  we continue to monitor our credit risk related to countries in europe 
as of december   our net receivables from publicly funded hospitals in italy  spain  portugal and greece were million compared to million as of december  in  and  net revenues from these countries was approximately of total net revenues in each of the years  and average days that accounts receivable were outstanding were  and days  respectively 
as of december  and 
table of contents december   net trade receivables from these countries were approximately and  respectively  of consolidated accounts receivable  net 
if global economic conditions deteriorate  we may experience delays in customer payments and reductions in our customers purchases from us 
also  we may incur higher credit losses related to the public hospital systems in these countries  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in and beyond 
we completed four late stage technology acquisitions and expanded our presence in the anesthesia market through the acquisition of all of the assets of lma international nv during the aggregate fair value of the consideration paid was approximately million  which includes initial consideration of approximately million  contingent consideration arrangements related to the businesses acquired  which were valued at million and a million favorable working capital adjustment related to the lma acquisition 
as of december   the aggregate amount of actual contingent consideration could be up to million 
we allocated the fair value of the million consideration paid to assets acquired of million  net of liabilities assumed of million 
the assets acquired included intangibles for technology  in process research and development  customer lists  tradenames and goodwill  aggregating approximately million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for additional information regarding our acquisitions 
we manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which we can access those funds on a cost effective basis 
at december   of our million of cash and cash equivalents  million was held at foreign subsidiaries 
we are not aware of any restrictions on repatriation of these funds and  subject to cash payment of additional us income taxes or foreign withholding taxes  these funds could be repatriated  if necessary 
any additional taxes could be offset  at least in part  by foreign tax credits 
the amount of any cash taxes  which could be significant  and the application of tax credits would be determined based on income tax laws in effect at the time of such repatriation 
we do not expect any such repatriation to result in additional tax expense as taxes have been provided for on unremitted foreign earnings that we do not consider permanently reinvested 
we depend on foreign sources of cash to fund a portion of our debt service requirements  substantially all of which relate to united states indebtedness  because the net cash provided by us based operating activities alone is not sufficient 
accordingly  we repatriated approximately million and million in and  respectively  of cash from our foreign subsidiaries to help fund debt service and other cash requirements

during  we received million of zero coupon greek government bonds the greek bonds in settlement of trade receivables due us from sales to the public hospital system in greece for  and at december   we had an allowance of million on receivables to be settled by the bonds 
during  we recorded additional losses of million and received million in proceeds from the sale of approximately million in principal amount of these greek bonds 
at december   we had approximately million of the greek bonds remaining on our balance sheet which were sold in january of the million fair value of the bonds at december  reflected the final value received from the january sale of the remaining

we believe our cash flow from operations  available cash and cash equivalents  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and sales of accounts receivable under our securitization program will enable us to fund our operating requirements  capital expenditures and debt obligations for the next months and the foreseeable future 
during  we completed a series of transactions that significantly restructured our debt obligations and borrowing capacity 
prepayment of notes 
we prepaid the entire outstanding million principal amount of our senior notes issued in notes 
in connection with this prepayment we paid a make whole payment to the holders of the notes of approximately million and paid accrued and unpaid interest of approximately million 
we used million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and available cash to fund these payments 
revolving credit facility borrowings and repayment 
we borrowed million under our revolving credit facility  of which million was used to fund the prepayment of our notes described above and the remainder was used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the vasonova acquisition 
we repaid the million using million of the proceeds from an additional term loan borrowing under our senior credit facility as described below  and million in proceeds from our sale of the marine business 
term loan borrowings and repayment  extension of maturities 
we entered into an agreement with lenders under our senior credit facility that provided an additional principal amount of million in term loan borrowings and used million of the proceeds to repay a portion of the borrowings under our revolving credit facility described above 
we subsequently repaid million of term loan borrowings under our senior credit facility using a portion of the proceeds of the senior subordinated notes due that we issued in june we obtained lender agreements to extend the maturity of million of term loans from october  to october  and to extend the termination of million of revolving credit facility commitments from october  to october  senior subordinated notes due on june   we issued million of senior subordinated notes due the notes 
we pay interest on the notes semi annually on june and december at a rate of per year 
the notes will mature on june   unless earlier redeemed 
we incurred transaction fees of approximately million  including underwriters discounts and commissions  in connection with the public offering of the notes 
as noted above  we used million of the net proceeds to repay term loan borrowings under our senior credit facility 
we also recorded a million write off of unamortized debt issuance costs as a loss on extinguishment of debt in the second quarter of termination of interest rate swap 
in december  we terminated our interest rate swap agreement that  at the date of termination  had a notional amount of million 
the interest rate swap was designated as a cash flow hedge against the term loan under our senior credit facility 
at the date of termination  the interest rate swap was in a liability position resulting in a cash payment of approximately million  which included million of accrued interest 
the termination of the interest rate swap resulted in an million cash outflow as reported in operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
as of december   all unrealized losses within accumulated other comprehensive income associated with this interest rate swap have been reclassified as interest expense in the consolidated statements of income loss

the year over year improvement in working capital from accounts receivable reflects a significant collection of receivables from the spanish government approximately million during the second quarter of  largely offset by higher net revenues in in the americas and emea 
the comparatively unfavorable change in accounts receivable in reflected the effect of the termination of a factoring agreement in italy approximately million and a slowdown in collections particularly in italy  spain and greece approximately million 
the year over year improvement in working capital related to inventories reflects a reduction in the build up of inventory in and inventory write offs of excess  slow moving and damaged product in asia in the increase in inventory reflected a planned worldwide build up of inventory primarily to improve service levels by accelerating fulfillment of customer orders 
the inventory increases in also included a million increase in the asia pacific region to stock a new distribution facility in singapore 
the year over year improvement in working capital from prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily reflects the collection of outstanding vat claims in these favorable year over year comparisons were partly offset by a reduction in deferred tax liability associated with potential future repatriation of non permanently reinvested foreign earnings in cash flow from investing activities net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was million during reflecting payments for businesses acquired of million  principally lma  and capital expenditures of million  partly offset by the proceeds from sales of businesses and assets of million

in addition  the decrease reflects a million increase in worldwide inventory levels  which was million greater than the million increase in inventory during the period 
we increased our inventory levels in principally to improve our service levels by accelerating fulfillment of customer orders 
the inventory increase also included a million increase in the asia pacific region to stock a new distribution facility in singapore 
these operating cash flow decreases as compared to the prior period were somewhat offset by a modestly smaller increase in accounts receivable during the twelve months ended december  as compared to the prior year period 
the accounts receivable increase in the period was million  million less than the increase during the same period in however  million of the increase in resulted from a change in accounting guidance that caused trade receivables under our asset securitization program to be included as accounts receivable on our balance sheet 
prior to the change in accounting guidance  the trade receivables were treated as sold and were not included in our balance sheet 
the increase in accounts receivable during the twelve months of reflects higher accounts receivable in europe of million  primarily due to the termination of a factoring agreement in italy approximately million  and a slowdown in payments  particularly in italy and spain approximately million 
during  we recognized additional litigation reserves of million associated with retained liabilities related to businesses that have been divested 
of the million recorded  million was associated with recall costs related to defective products  which was a subject of pending litigation related to our former commercial segment

the million paid for the acquisition of vasonova includes the initial payment of million plus a million contingent payment made to the former vasonova security holders upon receiving k clearance from the us food and drug administration less a hold back fee and cash in the business obtained in the acquisition 
cash flow from financing activities net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations totaled million during the twelve months ended december   which included proceeds from additional borrowings of million  including the issuance of our notes 
this additional indebtedness was partially 
table of contents offset by repayments of outstanding debt totaling million  including the prepayment of the notes totaling million and the repayment of million under our senior credit facility 
we incurred costs of million associated with the repayments of these amounts including the related make whole amounts paid to the holders of the notes and related fees and our additional borrowings 
we also paid million against our securitization program  made dividend payments of million and recognized proceeds of million from the exercise of outstanding stock options issued under our stock compensation plans 
financing arrangements the following table provides our net debt to total capital ratio dollars in millions net debt includes current borrowings long term borrowings total debt less cash and cash equivalents net debt total capital includes net debt shareholders equity total capital percent of net debt to total capital the increase in percentage of net debt to total capital in compared to was largely due to reductions in cash and cash equivalents and shareholders equity 
the decrease in cash was primarily a result of the purchase of lma in october of the decrease in shareholders equity was primarily a result of the million goodwill impairment charge recorded in the first quarter of fixed rate borrowings comprised of total borrowings at december  and december  our senior credit agreement and the indenture under which we issued our notes contain covenants that  among other things  limit or restrict our ability  and the ability of our subsidiaries  to incur debt  create liens  consolidate  merge or dispose of certain assets  make certain investments  engage in acquisitions  pay dividends on  repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock and enter into swap agreements 
our senior credit agreement also requires us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than and a consolidated interest coverage ratio generally  consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense  each as defined in the senior credit agreement of not less than as of the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters calculated pursuant to the definitions and methodology set forth in the senior credit agreement 
at december   our consolidated leverage ratio was and our interest coverage ratio was  both of which are in compliance with the limits described in the preceding sentence 
at december   we had no borrowings outstanding and approximately million in outstanding standby letters of credit under our million revolving credit facility 
this facility is used principally for seasonal working capital needs 
the availability of loans under our revolving credit facility is dependent upon our ability to maintain our financial condition and our continued compliance with the covenants contained in our senior credit agreement 
moreover  additional borrowings would be prohibited if a material adverse effect as defined in the senior credit agreement were to occur 
notwithstanding these restrictions  we believe our revolving credit facility provides us with significant flexibility to meet our foreseeable working capital needs 
at our current level of ebitda as defined in 
table of contents the senior credit agreement for the year ended december   we would have been permitted million of additional debt beyond the levels outstanding at december  moreover  additional capacity would be available if borrowed funds were used to acquire a business or businesses through the purchase of assets or controlling equity interests so long as the aforementioned leverage and interest coverage ratios are met after calculating ebitda on a proforma basis to give effect to the acquisition 
as of december   we were in compliance with all other terms of our senior credit agreement and our notes  and we expect to continue to be in compliance with the terms of these agreements  including the leverage and interest coverage ratios under our senior credit agreement  throughout in addition  we have an accounts receivable securitization facility under which we sell a security interest in domestic accounts receivable for consideration of up to million to a commercial paper conduit 
as of december   the maximum amount available for borrowing was million 
this facility is utilized from time to time to provide increased flexibility in funding short term working capital requirements 
the agreement governing the accounts receivable securitization facility contains certain covenants and termination events 
an occurrence of an event of default or a termination event under this facility may give rise to the right of our counterparty to terminate this facility 
as of december  and  we had million of outstanding borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility 
our convertible senior subordinated notes due the convertible notes are included in the dilutive earnings per share calculation using the treasury stock method 
under the treasury stock method  we must calculate the number of shares issuable under the terms of these notes based on the average market price of our common stock during the applicable reporting period  and include that number in the total diluted shares figure for the period 
at the time we sold our convertible notes  we entered into convertible note hedge and warrant agreements that together are intended to have the economic effect of reducing the net number of shares that will be issued upon conversion of the notes by  in effect  increasing the conversion price of the convertible notes  from our economic standpoint  to 
however  under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap  since the impact of the convertible note hedge agreements is anti dilutive  we exclude from the calculation of fully diluted shares the number of shares of our common stock that we would receive from the counterparties to these agreements upon settlement 
under the treasury stock method  changes in the share price of our common stock can have a significant impact on the number of shares that we must include in the fully diluted earnings per share calculation 
the following table provides examples of how changes in our stock price would impact the number of additional shares included in the denominator of the fully diluted earnings per share calculation total treasury stock method incremental shares 
the table also reflects the impact on the number of shares we could expect to issue upon concurrent settlement of the convertible notes  the warrant and the convertible note hedge incremental shares issued by teleflex upon conversion share price convertible note shares warrant shares total treasury stock method incremental shares shares due to teleflex under note hedge incremental shares issued by teleflex upon conversion represents the number of incremental shares that must be included in the calculation of fully diluted shares under us gaap 
represents the number of incremental shares to be issued by us upon conversion of the convertible notes  assuming concurrent settlement of the convertible note hedges and warrants 

table of contents our convertible notes are convertible under certain circumstances  including the attainment of of the conversion price approximately of the company s closing stock price during a certain number of days at the end of a fiscal quarter 
the company s closing stock price has recently approached this amount  which increases the possibility that the convertible notes could become convertible in the near future  at which point the convertible notes would be classified as a current liability 
the company has elected a net settlement method to satisfy its conversion obligation  under which the company may settle the principal amount of the convertible notes in cash and settle the excess conversion value in shares  plus cash in lieu of fractional shares 
the company believes that it has the ability to raise sufficient cash to repay the principal amounts due through a combination of utilizing our existing cash on hand  accessing our credit facility  or raising money in the capital markets

stock repurchase programs on june   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock 
repurchases of our stock under the board authorization may be made from time to time in the open market and may include privately negotiated transactions as market conditions warrant and subject to regulatory considerations 
the stock repurchase program has no expiration date and our ability to execute on the program will depend on  among other factors  cash requirements for acquisitions  cash generated from operations  debt repayment obligations  market conditions and regulatory requirements 
in addition  our senior credit facility and our notes limit our ability to repurchase shares and make other restricted payments 
accordingly  these provisions may limit our ability to repurchase shares under this board authorization 
through december   no shares have been purchased under this board authorization 
contractual obligations contractual obligations at december  are as follows payments due by period total less than year years years more than years dollars in thousands total borrowings interest obligations operating lease obligations minimum purchase obligations other postretirement benefits total contractual obligations interest payments on floating rate debt are based on the interest rate in effect on december  purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable pricing provisions and the approximate timing of the transactions 
these obligations relate primarily to material purchase requirements 
we recently announced that we will be relocating our corporate headquarters in the first half of in connection with the relocation  in december we entered into a lease for approximately  square feet of office space in wayne  pennsylvania 
the lease has an initial lease term of years and months  with an option to renew for an additional ten years 
aggregate rental payments during the initial term of the lease are expected to be approximately million 

table of contents we have recorded a noncurrent liability for uncertain tax positions of million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of ongoing or future tax examinations we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any income tax payments to settle uncertain income tax positions or the periods in which any such payments will be made 
in  cash contributions to all defined benefit pension plans were million  and we estimate the amount of cash contributions will be approximately million in due to the potential impact of future plan investment performance  changes in interest rates  changes in other economic and demographic assumptions and changes in legislation in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions  we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing and amount of contributions that may be required to fund our defined benefit plans for periods beyond see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for additional information 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
we have identified the following as critical accounting estimates  which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts in the ordinary course of business  we grant non interest bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms 
in an effort to reduce our credit risk  we i establish credit limits for all of our customer relationships  ii perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition  iii monitor the payment history and aging of our customers receivables  and iv monitor open orders against an individual customer s outstanding receivable balance 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for accounts receivable based on our historical collection experience and expected collectability of the accounts receivable  considering the period an account is outstanding  the financial position of the customer and information provided by credit rating services 
the adequacy of this allowance is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary 
in light of the disruptions in global economic markets  we instituted enhanced measures to facilitate customer by customer risk assessment when estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
such measures included  among others  monthly credit control committee meetings  at which customer credit risks are identified after review of  among other things  accounts that exceed specified credit limits  payment delinquencies and other customer problems 
in addition  for some of our non government customers  we instituted measures designed to reduce our risk exposures  including issuing dunning letters  reducing credit limits  requiring that payments accompany orders and instituting legal action with respect to delinquent accounts 
with respect to government customers  we evaluate receivables for potential collection risks associated with the availability of government funding and reimbursement practices 
some of our customers  particularly in europe  have extended or delayed payments for products and services already provided 
collectability concerns regarding our accounts receivable from these 
table of contents customers  for the most part in greece  italy  spain and portugal  is the primary cause for the increase in the allowance 
at december   these countries accounted for of our consolidated accounts receivable  net 
if the financial condition of these customers or the healthcare systems in these countries continue to deteriorate such that the ability of an increasing number of customers to make payments is uncertain  additional allowances may be required in future periods 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million at december  and million at december  which was and  respectively  of gross accounts receivable 
although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover the estimated losses which may occur when customers cannot make their required payments  we cannot be assured that we will continue to experience the same loss rate in the future given the volatility in the worldwide economy 
if our allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient to address receivables we ultimately determine are uncollectible  we would be required to incur additional charges  which could materially adversely affect our operating results 
moreover  our inability to collect outstanding receivables could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operations 
distributor rebates we offer rebates to certain distributors and reserve an estimate for the rebate as a reduction of revenues at the time of sale 
the estimate is based on an historical experience rate of rebate claims by distributors over the previous months for specific product lines 
the reserve for estimated rebates was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the increase in rebates in compared to is primarily due to the acquisition of lma 
inventory utilization inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
accordingly  we maintain a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory to reduce the carrying value of our inventories to reflect the diminution of value resulting from product obsolescence  damage or other issues affecting marketability by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value 
factors utilized in the determination of estimated market value include i current sales data and historical return rates  ii estimates of future demand  iii competitive pricing pressures  iv new product introductions  v product expiration dates  and vi component and packaging obsolescence 
the adequacy of this reserve is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary 
we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities 
in assessing historical usage  we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage 
our inventory reserve was million at december  and million at december  which equaled and of gross inventories  respectively 
accounting for long lived assets and investments the ability to realize long lived assets is evaluated periodically as events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amount 
the evaluation is based on various analyses  including undiscounted cash flow projections 
the analyses necessarily involve significant management judgment 
any impairment loss  if indicated  equals the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 

table of contents accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets at december  were as follows total dollars in millions goodwill intangible assets indefinite lived finite lived goodwill and intangible assets number of reporting units intangible assets may represent indefinite lived assets eg  certain trademarks or brands  determinable lived intangibles eg  certain trademarks or brands  customer relationships  patents and technologies or goodwill 
of these  only the costs of determinable lived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life 
determining the useful life of an intangible asset requires considerable judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles assets  primarily trademarks and brand names  are not amortized but are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter  using the first day of the quarter as the measurement date  or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
such conditions may include an economic downturn in a geographic market or a change in the assessment of future operations 
our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite lived intangibles 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital  are consistent with internal projections and operating plans 
we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 
goodwill goodwill impairment assessments are performed at a reporting unit level  our reporting units are generally businesses one level below the respective operating segment 
in applying the goodwill impairment test  we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
qualitative factors may include  but are not limited to  macroeconomic conditions  industry conditions  the competitive environment  changes in the market for our products and services  regulatory and political developments  entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance 
if  after completing such assessment  it is determined more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  we proceed to a two step quantitative impairment test 
alternatively  we may proceed directly to testing goodwill for impairment through the two step impairment test without conducting the qualitative analysis 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed a qualitative assessment on six of our reporting units that carry goodwill and determined  based on the qualitative assessment  that the fair value of each reporting unit was more likely than not higher than its carrying value 
for the two remaining reporting units that carry goodwill  the vascular and anesthesia respiratory reporting units  we elected to forgo the qualitative assessment and test them through the two step quantitative impairment test as discussed below 
the first step of the two step impairment test is to quantitatively compare the fair value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  with its carrying value 
in performing the first step  we calculate fair values of the various reporting units using equal weighting of two methods  one which estimates the discounted cash flows dcf of each of the reporting units based on projected earnings in the future the income approach and one which is based on sales of similar assets in actual transactions the 
table of contents market approach 
if the fair value exceeded the carrying value  there is no impairment 
if the reporting unit carrying amount exceeded the fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test would be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment 
the more significant judgments and assumptions made to determine the fair value of our reporting units were the amount and timing of expected future cash flows which are based primarily on our estimates of future sales  operating income  industry trends and the regulatory environment of the individual reporting units  the expected long term growth rates for each of our reporting units  which approximate the expected long term growth rate of the global economy and of the medical device industry  discount rates that are used to discount future cash flows to their present values  which are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units along with various market based inputs  determination of appropriate revenue and ebitda multiples used to estimate a reporting unit s fair value under the market approach and the selection of appropriate comparable companies to be used for purposes of determining those multiples 
there were no changes to the underlying methods used in as compared to the prior year valuations of our reporting units 
the dcf analysis utilized in the fourth quarter impairment test was performed over a ten year time horizon for each reporting unit 
the discount rate was for all reporting units 
a perpetual growth rate of was assumed for all reporting units 
in arriving at our estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit  we considered the results of both the income and the market approach and determined the fair value of each reporting unit based on the average of the results yielded by the two methods 
in addition  our current market capitalization was reconciled to the sum of the estimated fair values of the individual reporting units  plus a control premium  to ensure the fair value conclusions were reasonable in light of current market capitalization 
the control premium implied by our analysis was approximately  which was deemed to be within a reasonable range of observed average industry control premiums 
no impairment in the carrying value of any of our reporting units was evident as a result of the assessment of their respective fair values as determined under the methodology described above in the fourth quarter impairment test 
in  the fair value of our vascular and anesthesia respiratory reporting units exceed its respective carrying value by more than 
our expected future growth rates estimated for purposes of the goodwill impairment test are based on our estimates of future sales  operating income and cash flow and are consistent with our internal budgets and business plans which reflect a modest amount of core revenue growth coupled with the successful launch of new products each year  that collectively  more than offset volume losses from products that are expected to reach the end of their life cycle 
under the income approach  significant changes in assumptions would be required for these reporting units to fail the step one test 
for example  an increase of over in the discount rate or a decrease of over percent in the compound annual growth rate of operating income would be required to indicate impairment for these reporting units 
nevertheless  while we believe the assumed growth rates of sales and cash flows are reasonable and achievable the possibility remains that the constant currency revenue growth of this reporting unit may not perform as expected  and  as a result  the estimated fair value may decline 
if our strategy and or new products are not successful and we do not achieve core revenue growth in the future the goodwill in the vascular and anesthesia respiratory reporting units may become impaired and  in such case  we may incur material impairment charges 
in the first quarter of  we changed our north america reporting unit structure from a single reporting unit to five reporting units comprised of vascular  anesthesia respiratory  cardiac  surgical and specialty 
we allocated the assets and liabilities of our north america segment among the new reporting units based on their respective operating activities  and then allocated goodwill among the reporting units using a relative fair value approach  as required by fasb accounting standards codification asc topic 
table of contents following this allocation  we performed goodwill impairment tests on these new reporting units in the first quarter of as a result of these tests  we determined that three of the reporting units in our north america segment were impaired  and we recorded goodwill impairment charges of million in our vascular reporting unit  million in our anesthesia respiratory reporting unit and million in our cardiac reporting unit in the first quarter of intangible assets intangible assets are assets acquired that lack physical substance and that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill 
intangible assets we obtained through acquisitions are comprised mainly of technology  customer relationships  and trade names 
the fair value of acquired technology and trade names is estimated by the use of a relief from royalty method  which values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through the ownership of an asset 
under this method  an owner of an intangible asset determines the arm s length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license the asset from a third party 
the royalty  which is based on the estimated rate applied against forecasted sales  is tax effected and discounted to present value using a discount rate commensurate with the relative risk of achieving the cash flow attributable to the asset 
the fair value of acquired customer relationships is estimated by the use of an income approach known as the excess earnings method 
the excess earnings method measures economic benefit of an asset indirectly by calculating residual profit attributable to the asset after appropriate returns are paid with respect to complementary or contributory assets 
the residual profit is tax effected and discounted to present value at an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the estimated income stream 
management tests indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually  and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired 
similar to the goodwill impairment test process  we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value 
if  after completing such qualitative assessment  we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount  the asset is not impaired 
if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible assets is less than the carrying value  we then proceed to a quantitative impairment test  which consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible assets to their carrying amounts 
alternatively  we may elect to forgo the qualitative analysis and proceed directly to testing the indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment through the quantitative impairment test 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed a qualitative assessment on all of our indefinite lived assets  except for our taut tradename  and determined  based on the qualitative assessment  that their fair value was more likely than not higher than its carrying value 
for the taut tradename  we elected to test it through the quantitative impairment test as discussed below 
in connection with the quantitative impairment test  management tests for impairment by comparing the carrying value of intangible assets to their estimated fair values 
since quoted market prices are seldom available for intangible assets  we utilize present value techniques to estimate fair value 
common among such approaches is the relief from royalty methodology described above  under which management estimates the direct cash flows associated with the intangible asset 
management must estimate the hypothetical royalty rate  discount rate  and residual growth rate to estimate the forecasted cash flows associated with the asset 
discount rates and perpetual growth rates utilized in the impairment test of the indefinite lived asset during the fourth quarter of is comparable to the rates utilized in the impairment test of goodwill 
the compound annual growth rate in revenues projected to be generated from the trade name was and a royalty rate of was assumed 
discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows generated as a result of the respective intangible assets 
assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar trademarks or technologies are being licensed in the marketplace 

table of contents no impairment in the carrying value of our indefinite lived intangible asset was evident as a result of the assessment of its respective fair value as determined under the methodology described above 
we are not required to perform an annual impairment test for long lived assets  including finite lived intangible assets eg  customer relationships  instead  long lived assets are tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event 
triggering events include the likely ie  more likely than not disposal of a portion of such assets or the occurrence of an adverse change in the market involving the business employing the related assets 
significant judgments in this area involve determining whether a triggering event has occurred and re assessing the reasonableness of the remaining useful lives of finite lived assets by  among other things  assessing customer attrition rates 
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits we provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired employees  including pensions and postretirement healthcare benefits 
several statistical and other factors which are designed to project future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans 
these factors include actuarial assumptions about discount rates  expected rates of return on plan assets  compensation increases  turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates 
we review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
the weighted average assumptions for us and foreign plans used in determining net benefit cost were as follows pension other benefits discount rate rate of return initial healthcare trend rate ultimate healthcare trend rate significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense 
the following table shows the sensitivity of plan expenses and benefit obligations to changes in the weighted average assumptions assumed discount rate expected return on plan assets assumed healthcare trend rate basis point increase basis point decrease basis point change increase decrease dollars in millions net periodic pension and postretirement healthcare expense projected benefit obligation n a product warranty liability we warrant to the original purchaser of certain of our products that we will  at our option  repair or replace  without charge  such products if they fail due to a manufacturing defect 
warranty periods vary by product 
we have recourse provisions for certain products that would enable recovery from third parties for amounts paid under the warranty 
we accrue for product warranties when  based on available information  it is probable that customers will make claims under warranties relating to products that have been sold  and a reasonable estimate of the costs based on historical claims experience relative to sales can be made 
our estimated product warranty liability was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the decrease in the reserve is due to a settlement in of a retained liability related to a divested business 

table of contents share based compensation we estimate the fair value of share based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods 
share based compensation expense is measured using a black scholes option pricing model that takes into account highly subjective and complex assumptions with respect to expected life of options  volatility  risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield 
the expected life of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding  which is derived from the vesting period of the award  as well as historical exercise behavior 
expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility derived from publicly traded options to purchase our common stock  which we believe is more reflective of the market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than solely using historical volatility 
the risk free interest rate is the implied yield currently available on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option 
accounting for income taxes our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess uncertainties  make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates 
we conduct a broad range of operations around the world  subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous international jurisdictions  resulting at times in tax audits  disputes with tax authorities and potential litigation  the outcome of which is uncertain 
management must make judgments about such uncertainties and determine estimates of our tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using currently enacted tax rates  which we expect will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled 
the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income  our ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks  final us and foreign tax settlements  and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions 
while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience may require future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities  which could be material 
we are also required to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
we evaluate all positive and negative evidence and use judgments regarding past and future events  including operating results and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
based on this assessment  we determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized  in which case we apply a valuation allowance to offset our deferred tax assets in an amount equal to future tax benefits that may not be realized 
to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future  adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required 
the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of million and million at december  and december   respectively  relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions 
we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax asset 
the valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions under asc topic income taxes  which requires that a valuation allowance be established and maintained when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions 
we establish additional provisions for income taxes when  despite the belief that tax positions are supportable  there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold  which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority 
in the normal course of business  we are examined by various federal  
table of contents state and foreign tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
we adjust the income tax provision  the current tax liability and deferred taxes in any period in which facts that give rise to an adjustment become known 
specifically  we are currently in the midst of examinations by the us  canadian  czech republic  and austrian taxing authorities with respect to our income tax returns for those countries for various tax years 
the ultimate outcomes of the examinations of these returns could result in increases or decreases to our recorded tax liabilities  which would affect our financial results
