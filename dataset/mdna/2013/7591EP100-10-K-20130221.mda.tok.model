fico assessments 
in addition  the deposit insurance funds act of authorized the financing corporation fico to impose assessments on dif applicable deposits in order to service the interest on fico s bond obligations from deposit insurance fund assessments 
the amount assessed on individual institutions by fico will be in addition to the amount  if any  paid for deposit insurance according to the fdic s risk related assessment rate schedules 
fico assessment rates may be adjusted quarterly to reflect a change in assessment base 
regions bank had a fico assessment of million in fdic deposit premiums in acquisitions the bhc act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve before it may acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank or savings and loan association  if after such acquisition  the bank holding company will directly or indirectly own or control percent or more of the voting shares of the institution  it or any of its subsidiaries  other than a bank  may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or savings and loan association  or it may merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company 
financial holding companies and bank holding companies with consolidated assets exceeding billion must i obtain prior approval from the federal reserve before acquiring certain non bank financial companies with assets exceeding billion and ii provide prior written notice to the federal reserve before acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any company having consolidated assets of billion or more 
bank holding companies seeking approval to complete an acquisition must be well capitalized and well managed 
the bhc act further provides that the federal reserve may not approve any transaction that would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any section of the united states  or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any section of the country  or that in any other manner would be in restraint of trade  unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served 
the federal reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks concerned and the convenience and needs of the community to be served 
consideration of financial resources generally focuses on capital adequacy  and consideration of convenience and needs issues includes the parties performance under the cra  both of which are discussed below 
the federal reserve must also take into account the institutions effectiveness in combating money laundering 
in addition  pursuant to the dodd frank act  the bhc act was amended to require the federal reserve to  when evaluating a proposed transaction  consider the extent to which the transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the united states banking or financial system 
depositor preference under federal law  depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses and employee compensation against an insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution in the liquidation or other resolution of such an institution by any receiver 
incentive compensation guidelines adopted by the federal banking agencies pursuant to the fdia prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer  employee  director or principal stockholder 

table of contents in january  the fdic announced that it would seek public comment on whether banks with compensation plans that encourage risky behavior should be charged higher deposit assessment rates than such banks would otherwise be charged 
the comment period ended in february as of february  a final rule has not been adopted 
in june  the federal reserve issued comprehensive guidance on incentive compensation policies the incentive compensation guidance intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk taking 
the incentive compensation guidance  which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization  either individually or as part of a group  is based upon the key principles that a banking organization s incentive compensation arrangements should i provide incentives that do not encourage risk taking beyond the organization s ability to effectively identify and manage risks  ii be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management  and iii be supported by strong corporate governance  including active and effective oversight by the organization s board of directors 
any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organization s supervisory ratings  which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions 
the incentive compensation guidance provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk management control or governance processes pose a risk to the organization s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies 
in april  the federal reserve  other federal banking agencies and the securities and exchange commission jointly published proposed rulemaking designed to implement provisions of the dodd frank act prohibiting incentive compensation arrangements that would encourage inappropriate risk taking at a covered institution  which includes a bank or bank holding company with billion or more of assets  such as regions and regions bank 
the proposed rule i prohibits incentive based compensation arrangements that encourage executive officers  employees  directors or principal shareholders to expose the institution to inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation based on the standards for excessive compensation adopted pursuant to the fdia and ii prohibits incentive based compensation arrangements for executive officers  employees  directors or principal shareholders that could lead to a material financial loss for the institution 
the proposed rule requires covered institutions to establish policies and procedures for monitoring and evaluating their compensation practices 
institutions with consolidated assets of billion or more  such as regions  are subject to additional restrictions on compensation arrangements for their executive officers and any other persons indentified by the institution s board of directors as having the ability to expose the institution to substantial losses 
the comment period ended in may  but final rules have not been adopted as of february these regulations may become effective before the end of if the regulations are adopted in the form initially proposed  they will impose limitations on the manner in which we may structure compensation for our executives 
the scope and content of the us banking regulators policies on incentive compensation are continuing to develop 
it cannot be determined at this time whether a final rule will be adopted and whether compliance with such a final rule will adversely affect the ability of regions and its subsidiaries to hire  retain and motivate their key employees 
financial privacy the federal banking regulators have adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non public information about consumers to non affiliated third parties 
these limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and  in some circumstances  allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a non affiliated third party 
these regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors 
in addition  consumers may also prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service  such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and 
table of contents income information from applications 
consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services 
community reinvestment act regions bank is subject to the provisions of the cra 
under the terms of the cra  regions bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its communities  including providing credit to individuals residing in low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community  consistent with the cra 
the cra requires each appropriate federal bank regulatory agency  in connection with its examination of a depository institution  to assess such institution s record in assessing and meeting the credit needs of the community served by that institution  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the regulatory agency s assessment of the institution s record is made available to the public 
the assessment also is part of the federal reserve s consideration of applications to acquire  merge or consolidate with another banking institution or its holding company  to establish a new branch office that will accept deposits or to relocate an office 
in the case of a bank holding company applying for approval to acquire a bank or other bank holding company  the federal reserve will assess the records of each subsidiary depository institution of the applicant bank holding company  and such records may be the basis for denying the application 
regions bank received a satisfactory cra rating in its most recent examination 
usa patriot act a focus of governmental policy relating to financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing 
the usa patriot act of the usa patriot act broadened the application of anti money laundering regulations to apply to additional types of financial institutions such as broker dealers  investment advisors and insurance companies  and strengthened the ability of the us government to help prevent  detect and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism 
the principal provisions of title iii of the usa patriot act require that regulated financial institutions  including state member banks i establish an anti money laundering program that includes training and audit components  ii comply with regulations regarding the verification of the identity of any person seeking to open an account  iii take additional required precautions with non us owned accounts  and iv perform certain verification and certification of money laundering risk for their foreign correspondent banking relationships 
failure of a financial institution to comply with the usa patriot act s requirements could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution 
regions banking and insurance subsidiaries have augmented their systems and procedures to meet the requirements of these regulations and will continue to revise and update their policies  procedures and controls to reflect changes required by the usa patriot act and implementing regulations 
office of foreign assets control regulation the united states has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries  nationals and others 
these are typically known as the ofac rules based on their administration by the us treasury department office of foreign assets control ofac 
the ofac administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms 
generally  however  they contain one or more of the following elements i restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country  including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on us persons engaging in financial transactions relating to  making investments in  or providing investment related advice or assistance to  a sanctioned country  and ii a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest  by prohibiting transfers of property subject to us jurisdiction including property in the possession or control of us persons 
blocked assets us  property and bank deposits cannot be 
table of contents paid out  withdrawn  set off or transferred in any manner without a license from ofac 
failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences 
regulation of insurers and insurance brokers regions operations in the areas of insurance brokerage and reinsurance of credit life insurance are subject to regulation and supervision by various state insurance regulatory authorities 
although the scope of regulation and form of supervision may vary from state to state  insurance laws generally grant broad discretion to regulatory authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities 
this supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling of customer funds held in a fiduciary capacity 
certain of regions insurance company subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulatory supervision and to insurance laws and regulations requiring  among other things  maintenance of capital  record keeping  reporting and examinations 
regulation of residential mortgage loan originators on july   the federal reserve and other federal bank regulatory authorities adopted a final rule on the secure and fair enforcement for mortgage licensing act of safe act 
under the safe act  residential mortgage loan originators employed by banks  such as regions bank  must register with the nationwide mortgage licensing system and registry  obtain a unique identifier from the registry  and maintain their registration 
any residential mortgage loan originator who fails to satisfy these requirements will not be permitted to originate residential mortgage loans 
competition all aspects of regions business are highly competitive 
regions subsidiaries compete with other financial institutions located in the states in which they operate and other adjoining states  as well as large banks in major financial centers and other financial intermediaries  such as savings and loan associations  credit unions  consumer finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  investment companies  mutual funds  mortgage companies and financial service operations of major commercial and retail corporations 
regions expects competition to intensify among financial services companies due to the sustained low interest rate and ongoing low growth economic environment 
customers for banking services and other financial services offered by regions subsidiaries are generally influenced by convenience  quality of service  personal contacts  price of services and availability of products 
although regions position varies in different markets  regions believes that its affiliates effectively compete with other financial services companies in their relevant market areas 
employees as of december   regions and its subsidiaries had  employees

table of contents item a 
risk factors risks related to the operation of our business our businesses have been and may continue to be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally 
the capital and credit markets since have experienced unprecedented levels of volatility and disruption 
in some cases  the markets produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength 
dramatic declines in the housing market during recent years  with falling home prices  increased numbers of foreclosures and higher levels of unemployment and under employment  have adversely affected the credit performance of real estate related loans and resulted in  and may continue to result in  significant write downs of asset values by us and other financial institutions  including government sponsored entities and major commercial and investment banks 
these write downs  initially of mortgage backed securities but spreading to credit default swaps and other securities and loans  have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital  to reduce or eliminate dividends  to merge with larger and stronger institutions and  in some cases  to fail 
reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties  many lenders and institutional investors have reduced  and in some cases  ceased to provide funding to borrowers  including financial institutions 
although the economic slowdown that the united states experienced has begun to reverse and the markets have generally improved  business activities across a wide range of industries continue to face serious difficulties due to the lack of consumer spending and demand 
continued weakness in or a worsening of business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which we do business could have one or more of the following adverse effects on our business a decrease in the demand for  or the availability of  loans and other products and services offered by us  a decrease in the value of our loans held for sale or other assets secured by consumer or commercial real estate  an impairment of certain intangible assets  such as goodwill  a decrease in interest income from variable rate loans  due to declines in interest rates  and an increase in the number of clients and counterparties who become delinquent  file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to us 
an increase in the number of delinquencies  bankruptcies or defaults could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets  net charge offs  provisions for loan losses  and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale 
overall  during the past several years  the general business environment has had an adverse effect on our business 
although the general business environment has shown some improvement  there can be no assurance that it will continue to improve 
additionally  the improvement of certain economic indicators  such as real estate asset values and rents and unemployment  may vary between geographic markets and may continue to lag behind improvement in the overall economy 
these economic indicators typically affect certain industries  such as real estate and financial services  more significantly than other economic sectors 
for example  improvements in commercial real estate fundamentals typically lag broad economic recovery by twelve to eighteen months 
our clients include entities active in the real estate and financial services industries 
furthermore  financial services companies with a substantial lending business  like ours  are dependent upon the ability of their borrowers to make debt service payments on loans 
if economic conditions worsen or remain volatile  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
concerns about the european union s sovereign debt and the future of the euro have also caused uncertainty for financial markets globally 
such risks could indirectly affect us by affecting our hedging or other counterparties  as well as our customers with european businesses or assets denominated in the euro or companies in our markets with european businesses or affiliates 

table of contents ineffective liquidity management could adversely affect our financial results and condition 
effective liquidity management is essential for the operation of our business 
we require sufficient liquidity to meet customer loan requests  customer deposit maturities withdrawals  payments on our debt obligations as they come due and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions and other unpredictable circumstances causing industry or general financial market stress 
our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy generally 
factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a downturn in the geographic markets in which our loans and operations are concentrated or difficult credit markets 
our access to deposits may also be affected by the liquidity needs of our depositors 
in particular  a majority of our liabilities during were checking accounts and other liquid deposits  which are payable on demand or upon several days notice  while by comparison  a substantial majority of our assets were loans  which cannot be called or sold in the same time frame 
although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary  we might not be able to replace such funds in the future  especially if a large number of our depositors seek to withdraw their accounts  regardless of the reason 
a failure to maintain adequate liquidity could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our operations are concentrated in the southeastern united states  and adverse changes in the economic conditions in this region can adversely affect our performance and credit quality 
our operations are concentrated in the southeastern united states  particularly in the states of alabama  arkansas  georgia  florida  louisiana  mississippi and tennessee 
as a result  local economic conditions in the southeastern united states can significantly affect the demand for the products offered by regions bank including real estate  commercial and construction loans  the ability of borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans 
since  the national real estate market has experienced a significant decline in value  and the value of real estate in the southeastern united states in particular declined significantly more than real estate values in the united states as a whole 
this decline has had an adverse impact on some of our borrowers and on the value of the collateral securing many of our loans 
this decline may continue to affect borrowers and collateral values  which could adversely affect our currently performing loans  leading to future delinquencies or defaults and increases in our provision for loan losses 
further or continued adverse changes in these economic conditions could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
hurricanes and other weather related events  as well as man made disasters  could cause a disruption in our operations or other consequences that could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
a significant portion of our operations are located in the areas bordering the gulf of mexico and the atlantic ocean  regions that are susceptible to hurricanes  or in areas of the southeastern united states that are susceptible to tornadoes and other severe weather events 
such weather events can cause disruption to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our overall results of operations 
we maintain hurricane insurance  including coverage for lost profits and extra expense  however  there is no insurance against the disruption that a catastrophic hurricane could produce to the markets that we serve 
further  a hurricane or severe tornado in any of our market areas could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to timely repay their loans and may adversely affect the value of any collateral held by us 
man made disasters and other events connected with the gulf of mexico or atlantic ocean  such as the gulf oil spill  could have similar effects 
some of the states in which we operate have in recent years experienced extreme droughts 
the severity and impact of future hurricanes  severe tornadoes  droughts and other weather related events are difficult to predict and may be exacerbated by global climate change 
the effects of past or future hurricanes  severe tornadoes  droughts and other weather related events  as well as man made disasters  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents continued weakness in the residential real estate markets could adversely affect our performance 
as of december   consumer residential real estate loans represented approximately percent of our total loan portfolio 
this portion of our loan portfolio has been under pressure for several years as disruptions in the financial markets and the deterioration in housing markets and general economic conditions have caused a decline in home values  real estate market demand and the credit quality of borrowers 
any further declines in home values would adversely affect the value of collateral securing the residential real estate that we hold  as well as the volume of loan originations and the amount we realize on sale of real estate loans 
these factors could result in higher delinquencies and greater charge offs in future periods  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
continued weakness in the commercial real estate markets could adversely affect our performance 
facing continuing pressure from reduced asset values  high vacancy rates and reduced rents  the fundamentals within the commercial real estate sector also remain weak 
as of december   approximately percent of our loan portfolio consisted of investor real estate loans 
the properties securing income producing investor real estate loans are typically not fully leased at the origination of the loan 
the borrower s ability to repay the loan is instead dependent upon additional leasing through the life of the loan or the borrower s successful operation of a business 
weak economic conditions may impair a borrower s business operations and typically slow the execution of new leases 
such economic conditions may also lead to existing lease turnover 
as a result of these factors  vacancy rates for retail  office and industrial space may remain at elevated levels in high vacancy rates could result in rents falling further over the next several quarters 
the combination of these factors could result in further deterioration in the fundamentals underlying the commercial real estate market and the deterioration in value of some of our loans 
any such deterioration could adversely affect the ability of our borrowers to repay the amounts due under their loans 
as a result  our business  results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
if we experience greater credit losses in our loan portfolios than anticipated  our earnings may be materially adversely affected 
as a lender  we are exposed to the risk that our customers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans may not be sufficient to assure repayment 
credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio and provide an allowance for estimated credit losses based on a number of factors 
our management periodically determines the allowance for loan losses based on available information  including the quality of the loan portfolio  economic conditions  the value of the underlying collateral and the level of non accrual loans 
increases in this allowance will result in an expense for the period  thereby reducing our reported net income 
if  as a result of general economic conditions  a decrease in asset quality or growth in the loan portfolio  our management determines that additional increases in the allowance for loan losses are necessary  we may incur additional expenses which will reduce our net income  and our business  results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
although our management will establish an allowance for loan losses it believes is appropriate to absorb probable and reasonably estimable losses in our loan portfolio  this allowance may not be adequate 
in particular  if a hurricane or other natural disaster were to occur in one of our principal markets or if economic conditions in those markets were to deteriorate unexpectedly  additional loan losses not incorporated in the existing allowance for loan losses may occur 
losses in excess of the existing allowance for loan losses will reduce our net income and could adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition  perhaps materially 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies will periodically review our allowance for loan losses and the value attributed to non accrual loans and to real estate acquired through foreclosure 
such regulatory agencies may 
table of contents require us to adjust our determination of the value for these items 
these adjustments could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
risks associated with home equity products where we are in a second lien position could materially adversely affect our performance 
home equity products  particularly those where we are in a second lien position  and particularly those in certain geographic areas  may carry a higher risk of non collection than other loans 
home equity lending includes both home equity loans and lines of credit 
of our billion home equity portfolio at december   approximately billion were home equity lines of credit and billion were closed end home equity loans primarily originated as amortizing loans 
this type of lending  which is secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower s residence  allows customers to borrow against the equity in their home 
real estate market values at the time of origination directly affect the amount of credit extended  and  in addition  past and future changes in these values impact the depth of potential losses 
second lien position lending carries higher credit risk because any decrease in real estate pricing may result in the value of the collateral being insufficient to cover the second lien after the first lien position has been satisfied 
we have realized higher levels of charge offs on second lien positions  particularly in the state of florida  where real estate valuations have been depressed over the past several years 
as of december   approximately billion of our home equity lines and loans were in a second lien position approximately billion in florida 
we are unable to track payment status on first liens held by another institution  including payment status related to loan modifications 
when our second lien position becomes delinquent  an attempt is made to contact the first lien holder and inquire as to the payment status of the first lien 
however  we do not continuously monitor the payment status of the first lien position 
short sale offers and settlement agreements are often received by the home equity junior lien holders well before the loan balance reaches the delinquency threshold for charge off consideration  potentially resulting in a full balance payoff charge off 
we are presently monitoring the status of all first lien position loans that we own or service and also own a second lien  and we are taking appropriate action when delinquent 
during  we evaluated a means to monitor non regions serviced first liens using a third party service provider and found that the delinquency rates were not material 
as of december   none of our home equity lines of credit have converted to mandatory amortization under the contractual terms 
the majority of home equity lines of credit will either mature with a balloon payment or convert to amortizing status after fiscal year industry competition may have an adverse effect on our success 
our profitability depends on our ability to compete successfully 
we operate in a highly competitive environment 
certain of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do  enabling them to be more aggressive than us in competing for loans and deposits 
in our market areas  we face competition from other commercial banks  savings and loan associations  credit unions  internet banks  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  brokerage and investment banking firms  and other financial intermediaries that offer similar services 
some of our non bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern regions or regions bank and  therefore  may have greater flexibility in competing for business 
the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes  such as the repeal in of all federal prohibitions on the payment by depository institutions of interest on demand deposit accounts and the repeal in of all prohibitions on interstate branching by depository institutions 
should competition in the financial services industry intensify  our ability to effectively market our products and services and to retain or compete for new business may be adversely affected 
consequently  our business  financial condition or results of operations may also be adversely affected  perhaps materially 
rapid and significant changes in market interest rates may adversely affect our performance 
fluctuations in interest rates may adversely impact our business 
our profitability depends to a large extent on our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income received on interest earning 
table of contents assets primarily loans and investment securities and the interest expense incurred in connection with interest bearing liabilities primarily deposits and borrowings 
the level of net interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of interest earning assets  the average balance of interest bearing liabilities and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities 
these factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which  in turn  are impacted by external factors such as the local economy  competition for loans and deposits  the monetary policy of the federal open market committee of the federal reserve system the fomc and market interest rates 
the cost of our deposits and short term wholesale borrowings is largely based on short term interest rates  the level of which is driven primarily by the fomc s actions 
however  the yields generated by our loans and securities are typically driven by longer term interest rates  which are set by the market through benchmark interest rates such as the london interbank offered rates libor or  at times  the fomc s actions  and generally vary from day to day 
the level of net interest income is therefore influenced by movements in such interest rates and the pace at which such movements occur 
interest rate volatility can reduce unrealized gains or create unrealized losses in our portfolios 
if the interest rates on our interest bearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interest earning assets  our net interest income may decline and  with it  a decline in our earnings may occur 
our net interest income and earnings would be similarly affected if the interest rates on our interest earning assets declined at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interest bearing liabilities 
in particular  short term interest rates are currently very low by historical standards  with many benchmark rates  such as the federal funds rate and the one and three month libor near zero 
these low rates have reduced our cost of funding which has caused our net interest margin to increase 
our current one year interest rate sensitivity position is moderately asset sensitive  meaning that an immediate or gradual increase in interest rates would likely have a positive cumulative impact on regions twelve month net interest income 
alternatively  an immediate or gradual decrease in rates over a twelve month period would likely have a negative impact on twelve month net interest income 
an increasing interest rate environment would also increase debt service requirements for some of our borrowers 
such increases may adversely affect those borrowers ability to pay as contractually obligated and could result in additional delinquencies or charge offs 
our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected as a result 
for a more detailed discussion of these risks and our management strategies for these risks  see the net interest income and margin  market risk interest rate risk and securities sections of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation of this annual report on form k 
obligations currently rated below investment grade as well as possible future reductions in our credit ratings may increase our funding costs  place limitations on business activities related to providing credit support to customers  or contribute to ineffective liquidity management 
the major rating agencies regularly evaluate us and their ratings are based on a number of factors  including our financial strength and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally 
from through  all of the major ratings agencies downgraded regions and regions bank s credit ratings and many issued negative outlooks 
negative watch  negative outlook or other similar terms mean that a future downgrade is possible 
from august through october  however  four major rating agencies  standard poor s s p  fitch ratings fitch  moody s investor services moody s and dominion bond rating service dbrs  upwardly revised their outlook of regions from negative to stable and or positive reflecting the company s continued improvement in earnings performance  core capital position  and maintenance of a strong liquidity profile 
subsequent to the upward revision on their outlook  in march  s p upgraded the credit ratings of regions and regions bank including an upgrade of regions senior debt rating from bb to bbb following regions march stock offering and redemption of million shares of series a preferred stock 
table of contents issued to the us treasury 
additionally  in march fitch conducted a global review of securities impacted in part by capital requirements set forth in basel iii as well as fitch s view regarding the likelihood of sovereign support 
the review resulted in a downgrade of regions junior subordinated debt rating from bb to b 
in december  moody s upgraded regions senior debt ratings from ba to ba  citing declining net charge offs and loan delinquencies  as well as enhancements to the risk management structure 
currently  regions senior debt ratings are ba  bbb  bbb and bbb by moody s  s p  fitch and dbrs  respectively 
in general  ratings agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors  including capital adequacy  liquidity  asset quality  business mix and level and quality of earnings  and we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings 
the ratings assigned to regions and regions bank remain subject to change at any time  and it is possible that any ratings agency will take action to downgrade regions  regions bank or both in the future 
additionally  ratings agencies may also make substantial changes to their ratings policies and practices which may affect our credit ratings 
in the future  changes to existing ratings guidelines and new ratings guidelines may  among other things  adversely affect the ratings of our securities or other securities in which we have an economic interest 
regions credit ratings can have negative consequences that can impact our ability to access the debt and capital markets  as well as reduce our profitability through increased costs on future debt issuances 
specifically  when regions was downgraded below investment grade status  we became unable to reliably access the short term unsecured funding markets  which caused us to hold more cash and liquid investments to meet our on going cash needs 
such actions reduced our profitability as these liquid investments earned a lower return than other assets  such as loans 
regions liquidity policy requires that we maintain a minimum cash requirement that is the greater of the next two years of corporate dividend payments and debt service and maturities less the next one year of bank dividends  or the next one year of corporate dividend payments and debt service and maturities 
the current working limit does not allow the minimum cash requirement to fall below million 
the conservative nature of this policy helps protect us against the costs of unexpected adverse funding environments 
future issuances of debt could cost regions more in interest costs were such debt to be issued at our current debt rating 
any future downgrades would further increase the interest costs associated with potential future borrowings  the cost of which cannot be estimated due to the uncertainty of future issuances in terms of amount and priority 
additionally  at the time regions was downgraded to below investment grade  certain counterparty contracts were required to be renegotiated  resulting in additional collateral postings of approximately million 
refer to note  derivative financial instruments and hedging activities  contingent features to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k for the fair value of contracts subject to contingent credit features and the collateral postings associated with such contracts 
future downgrades could require regions to post additional collateral 
while the exact amount of additional collateral is unknown  it is reasonable to conclude that regions may be required to post approximately an additional million related to existing contracts with contingent credit features 
in early  as a result of the ratings upgrades that occurred during  approximately million of this additional collateral has been returned to regions 
if due to future downgrades  we were required to cancel our derivatives contracts with certain counterparties and were unable to replace such contracts  our market risk profile could be altered 
regions believes that this market risk exposure would be immaterial to its consolidated financial position  liquidity and results of operations 
the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets may decline in the future 
as of december   we had billion of goodwill and million of other intangible assets 
a significant decline in our expected future cash flows  a significant adverse change in the business climate  slower growth rates or a significant and sustained decline in the price of our common stock  any or all of which could be materially impacted by many of the risk factors discussed herein  may necessitate our taking charges in the future related to the impairment of our goodwill 
future regulatory actions could also have a material impact on 
table of contents assessments of goodwill for impairment 
if the fair value of our net assets improves at a faster rate than the market value of our reporting units  or if we were to experience increases in book values of a reporting unit in excess of the increase in fair value of equity  we may also have to take charges related to the impairment of our goodwill 
if we were to conclude that a future write down of our goodwill and other intangible assets is necessary  we would record the appropriate charge  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
a goodwill impairment charge is a non cash item that does not have an adverse impact on regulatory capital 
identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill consist of core deposit intangibles  purchased credit card relationship assets  and customer relationship employment assets 
adverse events or circumstances could impact the recoverability of these intangible assets including loss of core deposits  significant losses of credit card accounts and or balances  increased competition or adverse changes in the economy 
to the extent these intangible assets are deemed unrecoverable  a non cash impairment charge would be recorded 
the value of our deferred tax assets could adversely affect our operating results and regulatory capital ratios 
as of december   regions had approximately million in net deferred tax assets  of which million was disallowed when calculating regulatory capital 
our deferred tax assets are subject to an evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that they will be realized for financial statement purposes 
in making this determination  we consider all positive and negative evidence available including the impact of recent operating results as well as potential carryback of tax to prior years taxable income  reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  tax planning strategies and projected earnings within the statutory tax loss carryover period 
we have determined that the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized at december  except for million related to state deferred tax assets for which we have established a valuation allowance 
if we were to conclude that a significant portion of our deferred tax assets were not more likely than not to be realized  the required valuation allowance could adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and regulatory capital ratios 
changes in the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 
our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions 
financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty or other relationships 
we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties  and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  investment banks  mutual and hedge funds  and other institutional clients 
furthermore  although we do not hold any european sovereign debt  we may do business with and be exposed to financial institutions that have been affected by the recent european sovereign debt crisis 
as a result  defaults by  or even mere speculation about  one or more financial services companies  or the financial services industry generally  may lead to market wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions 
many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client 
in addition  our credit risk may be exacerbated if the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us 
we are unable to make assurances that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
potential limitations on incentive compensation contained in proposed federal agency rulemaking may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain our highest performing employees 
in april  the federal reserve  other federal banking agencies and the securities and exchange commission jointly published proposed rules designed to implement provisions of the dodd frank act prohibiting incentive compensation arrangements that would encourage inappropriate risk taking at covered financial institutions  which includes a bank or bank holding company with billion or more of assets  such as 
table of contents regions and regions bank 
it cannot be determined at this time whether or when a final rule will be adopted and whether compliance with such a final rule will substantially affect the manner in which we structure compensation for our executives and other employees 
depending on the nature and application of the final rules  we may not be able to successfully compete with certain financial institutions and other companies that are not subject to some or all of the rules to retain and attract executives and other high performing employees 
if this were to occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected  perhaps materially 
maintaining or increasing market share may depend on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services 
our success depends  in part  on the ability to adapt products and services to evolving industry standards 
there is increasing pressure to provide products and services at lower prices 
this can reduce net interest income and noninterest income from fee based products and services 
in addition  the widespread adoption of new technologies could require us to make substantial capital expenditures to modify or adapt existing products and services or develop new products and services 
we may not be successful in introducing new products and services in response to industry trends or developments in technology  or those new products may not achieve market acceptance 
as a result  we could lose business  be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract clients  or be subject to cost increases 
as a result  our business  financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 
we need to stay current on technological changes in order to compete and meet customer demands 
the financial services market  including banking services  is undergoing rapid changes with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
in addition to better serving customers  the effective use of technology increases efficiency and may enable us to reduce costs 
our future success may depend  in part  on our ability to use technology to provide products and services that provide convenience to customers and to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
some of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements than we currently have 
we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers 
as a result  our ability to effectively compete to retain or acquire new business may be impaired  and our business  financial condition or results of operations  may be adversely affected 
our customers may pursue alternatives to bank deposits which could force us to rely on relatively more expensive sources of funding 
we may experience an outflow of deposits because customers seek investments with higher yields or greater financial stability  prefer to do business with our competitors  or otherwise 
this outflow of deposits could force us to rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding to fund our business and meet withdrawal demands  thereby adversely affecting our net interest margin 
we may also be forced  as a result of any outflow of deposits  to rely more heavily on equity to fund our business  resulting in greater dilution of our existing shareholders 
as a result  our business  financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 
we are subject to a variety of operational risks  environmental  legal and compliance risks  and the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders  which may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we are exposed to many types of operational risks  including reputational risk  legal and compliance risk  the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders  and unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors  including clerical or record keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems 
negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities  including lending practices  corporate governance and acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities 
negative public opinion 
table of contents can adversely affect our ability to attract and keep customers and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action 
actual or alleged conduct by regions can also result in negative public opinion about our other businesses 
negative public opinion could also affect our credit ratings  which are important to our access to unsecured wholesale borrowings 
if personal  non public  confidential or proprietary information of customers in our possession were to be misappropriated  mishandled or misused  we could suffer significant regulatory consequences  reputational damage and financial loss 
such mishandling or misuse could include  for example  erroneously providing such information to parties who are not permitted to have the information  either by fault of our systems  employees  or counterparties  or the interception or inappropriate acquisition of such information by third parties 
because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions  certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified 
our necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process transactions and our large transaction volume may further increase the risk that technical flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect 
we also may be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control for example  computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages  or natural disasters  disease pandemics or other damage to property or physical assets which may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability 
we are further exposed to the risk that our external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as we are and to the risk that our or our vendors business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate 
the occurrence of any of these risks could result in our diminished ability to operate our business for example  by requiring us to expend significant resources to correct the defect  as well as potential liability to clients  reputational damage and regulatory intervention  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations  perhaps materially 
we are subject to a variety of systems failure and cyber security risks that could adversely affect our business and financial performance 
failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure  or those of our third party vendors and other service providers  including as a result of cyber attacks  could disrupt our businesses or the businesses of our customers  result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information  damage our reputation  increase our costs and cause losses 
as a large financial institution  we depend on our ability to process  record and monitor a large number of customer transactions on a continuous basis 
as customer  public and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased  our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures  disruptions and breakdowns 
our business  financial  accounting  data processing systems or other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors  including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control 
for example  there could be sudden increases in customer transaction volume  electrical or telecommunications outages  natural disasters such as earthquakes  tornadoes and hurricanes  disease pandemics  events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters  including terrorist acts  and  as described below  cyber attacks 
although we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place  our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers 
information security risks for large financial institutions such as regions have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies  the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions  and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime  hackers  terrorists  activists and other external parties 
as noted above  our operations rely on the secure processing  transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks 
in addition  to access our products and services  our customers may use personal smartphones  tablet pcs  and other 
table of contents mobile devices that are beyond our control systems 
although we believe that we have robust information security procedures and controls  our technologies  systems  networks and our customers devices may be the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release  gathering  monitoring  misuse  loss or destruction of regions or our customers confidential  proprietary and other information 
additionally  cyber attacks  such as denial of service attacks  hacking or terrorist activities  could disrupt regions or our customers or other third parties business operations 
for example  in october and december  a group launched denial of service attacks against a number of large financial services institutions 
regions was targeted by this group in october and december 
these events did not result in a breach of regions client data  and account information remained secure  however  the attacks did adversely affect the performance of regions bank s website  www 
regions 
com  and  in some instances  prevented customers from accessing regions bank s secure websites for consumer and commercial applications 
the october event was resolved within approximately one day 
the december events occurred over multiple days  but each individual event was of a shorter duration than the october event and was promptly resolved 
in all cases  the attacks primarily resulted in inconvenience  however  future cyber attacks could be more disruptive and damaging  and regions may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks 
third parties with which we do business or that facilitate our business activities could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us  including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints 
our risk and exposure to cyber attacks and other information security breaches remain heightened because of  among other things  the evolving nature of these threats and the prevalence of internet and mobile banking 
as cyber threats continue to evolve  we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities 
disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers  or cyber attacks or security breaches of the networks  systems or devices that our customers use to access our products and services  could result in customer attrition  regulatory fines  penalties or intervention  reputational damage  reimbursement or other compensation costs and or additional compliance costs  any of which could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure 
third parties provide key components of our business operations such as data processing  recording and monitoring transactions  online banking interfaces and services  internet connections and network access 
while we have selected these third party vendors carefully  we do not control their actions 
any problems caused by these third parties  including those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor  failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes  or failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services  could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business 
financial or operational difficulties of a third party vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor s ability to serve us 
replacing these third party vendors could also create significant delay and expense 
accordingly  use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to our business operations 
we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties 
in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties  we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of clients and counterparties  including financial statements and other financial information 
we also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and  with respect to financial statements  on reports of independent auditors if made available 
if this information is inaccurate  we may be subject to regulatory action  reputational harm or other adverse effects with respect to the operation of our business  our financial condition and our results of operations 

table of contents we are exposed to risk of environmental liability when we take title to property 
in the course of our business  we may foreclose on and take title to real estate 
as a result  we could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties 
we may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage  personal injury  investigation and clean up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property 
the costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial 
in addition  if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site  we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property 
if we become subject to significant environmental liabilities  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 
our reported financial results depend on management s selection of accounting methods and certain assumptions and estimates 
our accounting policies and assumptions are fundamental to our reported financial condition and results of operations 
our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with generally accepted accounting principles and reflect management s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results 
in some cases  management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives  any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances  yet may result in us reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative 
certain accounting policies are critical to presenting our reported financial condition and results 
they require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain 
materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates 
these critical accounting policies include the allowance for credit losses  fair value measurements  intangible assets  mortgage servicing rights  and income taxes 
because of the uncertainty of estimates involved in these matters  we may be required to do one or more of the following significantly increase the allowance for credit losses and or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the reserve provided  recognize significant impairment on our goodwill  other intangible assets or deferred tax asset balances  or significantly increase our accrued income taxes 
changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition 
from time to time  the financial accounting standards board the fasb and sec change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements 
these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively  resulting in us restating prior period financial statements 
for example  on december   the fasb issued for public comment a proposed accounting standards update  financial instruments credit losses subtopic  that would substantially change the accounting for credit losses on loans and other financial assets held by banks  financial institutions and other organizations 
the proposal would remove the existing probable threshold in gaap for recognizing credit losses and instead require affected reporting companies to reflect their estimate of credit losses on financial assets over the lifetime of each such asset  broadening the range of information that must be considered in measuring the allowance for expected credit losses 
this proposal  if adopted as proposed  will likely have a negative impact  potentially material  on regions reported earnings and capital and could also have an impact on regions bank s lending to the extent that higher reserves are required at the inception of a loan based on recent loan loss experience 

table of contents risks arising from the legal and regulatory framework in which our business operates increased litigation could result in legal liability and damage to our reputation 
we and certain of our subsidiaries have been named from time to time as defendants in various class actions and other litigation relating to their business and activities 
past  present and future litigation have included or could include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages 
we and certain of our subsidiaries are also involved from time to time in other reviews  investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental and self regulatory agencies regarding our and their business 
these matters also could result in adverse judgments  settlements  fines  penalties  injunctions or other relief 
in addition  in recent years  a number of judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories  collectively termed lender liability 
generally  lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty  whether implied or contractual  of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or shareholders 
substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us or our subsidiaries could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations or cause significant harm to our reputation 
additional information relating to litigation affecting regions and our subsidiaries is discussed in note commitments  contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k 
we may face significant claims for indemnification in connection with our sale of morgan keegan in on january   regions entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell morgan keegan and related affiliates to raymond james financial  inc raymond james 
the transaction closed on april  in connection with the closing of the sale  regions agreed to indemnify raymond james for all litigation and certain other matters related to pre closing activities of morgan keegan 
indemnifiable losses under the indemnification provision include legal and other expenses  such as costs for defense  judgments  settlements and awards associated with the resolution of litigation related to pre closing activities 
as of december  the carrying value of the indemnification obligation is approximately million 
this amount reflects an estimate of liability  and actual liabilities can potentially be higher than amounts reserved 
the amount of liability that we may ultimately incur from indemnification claims may have an adverse impact  perhaps materially  on our results of operations 
we are subject to extensive governmental regulation  which could have an adverse impact on our operations 
the banking industry is extensively regulated and supervised under both federal and state law 
regions and regions bank are subject to the regulation and supervision of the federal reserve  the fdic  the consumer financial protection bureau and the superintendent of banking of the state of alabama 
these regulations are intended primarily to protect depositors  the public and the fdic insurance fund  and not our shareholders 
these regulations govern a variety of matters  including certain debt obligations  changes in control of bank holding companies and state chartered banks  maintenance of adequate capital by bank holding companies and state chartered banks  and general business operations and financial condition of regions and regions bank including permissible types  amounts and terms of loans and investments  the amount of reserves against deposits  restrictions on dividends  establishment of branch offices  and the maximum interest rate that may be charged by law 
additionally  all of our non bank subsidiaries are subject to oversight by the federal reserve  and certain of our other subsidiaries are subject to regulation  supervision and examination by other regulatory authorities  such as state insurance departments 
as a result  we are subject to changes in federal and state law  as well as regulations and governmental policies  income tax laws and accounting principles 
regulations affecting banks and other financial institutions are undergoing continuous review and frequently change  and the ultimate effect of such changes cannot be 
table of contents predicted 
regulations and laws may be modified at any time  and new legislation may be enacted that will affect us  regions bank and our subsidiaries 
any changes in any federal and state law  as well as regulations and governmental policies  income tax laws and accounting principles  could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways  including ways which may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
failure to appropriately comply with any such laws  regulations or principles could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies  civil money penalties or damage to our reputation  all of which could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our regulatory position is discussed in greater detail under the bank regulatory capital requirements section and associated capital ratios table of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation of this annual report on form k 
recent legislation regarding the financial services industry may have a significant adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 
the dodd frank act became law in july many of the provisions of the dodd frank act will directly affect our ability to conduct our business including imposition of higher prudential standards  including more stringent risk based capital  leverage  liquidity and risk management requirements  and numerous other requirements on systemically significant institutions  including all bank holding companies with assets of at least billion which includes regions  establishment of the financial stability oversight council to identify and impose additional regulatory oversight of large financial firms  imposition of additional costs and fees  including fees to be set by the federal reserve and charged to systemically significant institutions to cover the cost of regulating such institutions and any fdic assessment made to cover the costs of any regular or special examination of regions or its affiliates  establishment of the consumer financial protection bureau with broad authority to implement new consumer protection regulations and to examine and enforce compliance with federal consumer laws  application to bank holding companies of regulatory capital requirements similar to those applied to banks  which requirements exclude  on a phase out basis  all trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred stock from tier capital  and establishment of new rules and restrictions regarding the origination of mortgages 
many of the provisions of the dodd frank act became effective in july  on the one year anniversary of its enactment 
however  a number of these other provisions still require extensive rulemaking  guidance and interpretation by regulatory authorities and have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates 
accordingly  in some respects  the ultimate impact of the dodd frank act and its effect on regions and the us financial system generally may not be known for some time 
the provisions of the dodd frank act and any future rules adopted to implement those provisions as well as any additional legislative or regulatory changes may impact the profitability of our business activities and costs of operations  require that we change certain of our business practices  materially affect our business model or affect retention of key personnel  require us to raise additional regulatory capital  including additional tier capital  and could expose us to additional costs including increased compliance costs 
these and other changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes and may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business as previously conducted or our results of operations or financial condition 
increases in fdic insurance premiums may adversely affect our earnings 
our deposits are insured by the fdic up to legal limits and  accordingly  we are subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments 
we generally cannot control the amount of premiums we will be required to pay for fdic 
table of contents insurance 
high levels of bank failures over the past several years and increases in the statutory deposit insurance limits have increased resolution costs to the fdic and put pressure on the deposit insurance fund dif 
in order to maintain a strong funding position and restore the reserve ratios of the dif  the fdic increased assessment rates on insured institutions  charged a special assessment to all insured institutions as of june   and required banks to prepay three years worth of premiums on december  if there are additional financial institution failures  we may be required to pay even higher fdic premiums than the recently increased levels  or the fdic may charge additional special assessments 
further  the fdic increased the dif s target reserve ratio to percent of insured deposits following the dodd frank act s elimination of the percent cap on the dif s reserve ratio 
additional increases in our assessment rate may be required in the future to achieve this targeted reserve ratio 
these increases in deposit assessments and any future increases  required prepayments or special assessments of fdic insurance premiums may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
additionally  in february  pursuant to the dodd frank act  the fdic amended its regulations regarding assessment for federal deposit insurance to base such assessments on the average total consolidated assets of the insured institution during the assessment period  less the average tangible equity of the institution during the assessment period 
the fdic also adopted a revised risk based assessment calculation in february in january  the fdic proposed a rule tying assessment rates of fdic insured institutions to the institution s employee compensation programs 
comments were due on february   but as of february  no final rule has been adopted 
the exact nature and cumulative effect of these recent changes are not yet known  but they may increase the amount of premiums we must pay for fdic insurance 
any such increases may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we may be subject to more stringent capital requirements 
regions and regions bank are each subject to capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines and other regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and types of capital that must be maintained 
from time to time  the regulators implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines 
if we fail to meet these minimum capital and liquidity guidelines and other regulatory requirements  our financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
in light of proposed changes to regulatory capital requirements contained in the dodd frank act and the federal reserve s proposed rules implementing regulatory accords on international banking institutions formulated as part of the basel committee iii process  we expect to be required to satisfy additional  more stringent  capital adequacy and liquidity standards 
we may also be required to satisfy additional  more stringent capital adequacy and liquidity standards than those specified as part of the dodd frank act and the federal reserve s proposed rules implementing basel iii  or comply with the requirements of these standards earlier than might otherwise be required  in order to successfully comply with the capital planning and stress test rules and guidance issued by the federal reserve 
the ultimate impact of the new capital and liquidity standards on us cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors  including the treatment and implementation by the us banking regulators 
these requirements  however  and any other new regulations  could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends  or could require us to reduce business levels or to raise capital  including in ways that may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
for more information concerning our compliance with capital and liquidity requirements  see the bank regulatory capital requirements section of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation of this annual report on form k 
unfavorable results from ongoing stress analyses conducted on regions may adversely affect our ability to retain customers or compete for new business opportunities 
under the final rules discussed under regulatory reforms federal reserve s comprehensive capital analysis and review in the supervision and regulation section of item of this annual report on form k  the federal reserve conducts an annual stress analysis of regions to evaluate our ability to absorb losses in various economic and financial scenarios 
this stress analysis uses three economic and financial scenarios 
table of contents generated by the federal reserve  including adverse and severely adverse scenarios 
the rules also require us to conduct our own semi annual stress analysis to assess the potential impact on regions  including our consolidated earnings  losses and capital  under each of the economic and financial scenarios used as part of the federal reserve s annual stress analysis 
a summary of the results of certain aspects of the federal reserve s annual stress analysis is released publicly and contains bank holding company specific information and results 
the rules also require us to disclose publicly a summary of the results of our semi annual stress analyses  and regions banks annual stress analyses  under the severely adverse scenario 
although the stress tests are not meant to assess our current condition  and even if we remain strong  stable and well capitalized  we cannot predict our customers potential misinterpretation of  and adverse reaction to  the results of these stress tests 
any potential misinterpretations and adverse reactions could limit our ability to attract and retain customers or to effectively compete for new business opportunities 
the inability to attract and retain customers or effectively compete for new business may have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
additionally  our regulators may require us to raise additional capital or take other actions  or may impose restrictions on our business  based on the results of the stress tests  including rejecting or requiring revisions to our annual capital plan submitted in connection with the comprehensive capital analysis and review 
we may not be able to raise additional capital if required to do so  or may not be able to do so on terms which are advantageous to regions or its current shareholders 
any such capital raises  if required  may also be dilutive to our existing shareholders 
if an orderly liquidation of a systemically important bank holding company or non bank financial company were triggered  we could face assessments for the orderly liquidation fund 
the dodd frank act creates a new mechanism  the ola  for liquidation of systemically important bank holding companies and non bank financial companies 
the ola is administered by the fdic and is based on the fdic s bank resolution model 
the secretary of the us treasury may trigger a liquidation under this authority only after consultation with the president of the united states and after receiving a recommendation from the boards of the fdic and the federal reserve upon a two thirds vote 
liquidation proceedings will be funded by the orderly liquidation fund  which will borrow from the us treasury and impose risk based assessments on covered financial companies 
risk based assessments would be made  first  on entities that received more in the resolution than they would have received in the liquidation to the extent of such excess  and second  if necessary  on  among others  bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of billion or more  such as regions 
any such assessments may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
risks related to our capital stock the market price of shares of our capital stock will fluctuate 
the market price of our capital stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations or business prospects 
such risks may be affected by our operating performance  financial condition and prospects  or the operating performance  financial condition and prospects of our competitors  operating results that vary from the expectations of management  securities analysts and investors  our creditworthiness  developments in our business or in the financial sector generally  regulatory changes affecting our industry generally or our business and operations  the operating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us  
table of contents announcements of strategic developments  acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors  expectations of or actual equity dilution  whether we declare or fail to declare dividends on our capital stock from time to time  the ratings given to our securities by credit rating agencies  changes in the credit  mortgage and real estate markets  including the markets for mortgage related securities  and changes in global financial markets  global economies and general market conditions  such as interest or foreign exchange rates  stock  commodity  credit or asset valuations or volatility 
stock markets in general and our common stock in particular have shown considerable volatility in the recent past 
the market price of our capital stock  including our common stock and depositary shares representing fractional interests in our preferred stock  may continue to be subject to similar fluctuations unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 
increased volatility could result in a decline in the market price of our capital stock 
our capital stock is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness 
our capital stock  including our common stock and depositary shares representing fractional interests in our preferred stock  ranks junior to all of regions existing and future indebtedness and regions other non equity claims with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against us  including claims in the event of our liquidation 
as of december   regions total liabilities were approximately billion  and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future to increase our capital resources 
additionally  if our capital ratios or the capital ratios of regions bank fall below the required minimums  we or regions bank could be forced to raise additional capital by making additional offerings of debt securities  including medium term notes  senior or subordinated notes or other applicable securities 
we are a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for dividends  distributions and other payments 
we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our banking and other subsidiaries 
our principal source of cash flow  including cash flow to pay dividends to our stockholders and principal and interest on our outstanding debt  is dividends from regions bank 
there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by regions bank to us  as well as by us to our stockholders 
regulations of both the federal reserve and the state of alabama affect the ability of regions bank to pay dividends and other distributions to us and to make loans to us 
if regions bank is unable to make dividend payments to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available  we may not be able to make dividend payments to our common and preferred stockholders or principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt 
see the stockholders equity section of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation of this annual report on form k 
in addition  our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary  except to the extent that any of our claims as a creditor of such subsidiary may be recognized 
as a result  shares of our capital stock are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of our subsidiaries 
at december   our subsidiaries total deposits and borrowings were approximately billion 
we may not pay dividends on shares of our capital stock 
holders of shares of our capital stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments 
although we have historically declared cash 
table of contents dividends on our common stock  we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future 
this could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
on november   regions completed the sale of million depositary shares each representing a th ownership interest in a share of its non cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a  par value per share series a preferred stock  with a liquidation preference of  per share of series a preferred stock equivalent to per depositary share 
dividends on the series a preferred stock are discretionary and are not cumulative 
if our board of directors does not declare a dividend on the series a preferred stock in respect of a quarterly dividend period  then no dividend shall be deemed to have accrued for such dividend period  no dividend shall be payable on the applicable dividend payment date or be cumulative  and we will have no obligation to pay any dividend for that dividend period  whether or not our board of directors declares a dividend on the series a preferred stock or any other class or series of our capital stock for any future dividend period 
furthermore  the terms of the series a preferred stock prohibit regions from declaring or paying any dividends on any junior series of its capital stock  including its common stock  or from repurchasing  redeeming or acquiring such junior stock  unless regions has declared and paid full dividends on the series a preferred stock for the most recently completed dividend period 
additionally  the terms of regions outstanding junior subordinated debt securities prohibit it from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on regions capital stock  or purchasing  acquiring or making a liquidation payment on such stock  if regions has given notice of its election to defer interest payments but the related deferral period has not yet commenced or a deferral period is continuing 
regions is also subject to statutory and regulatory limitations on its ability to pay dividends on its capital stock 
for example  it is the policy of the federal reserve that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of earnings  and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization s expected future needs  asset quality and financial condition 
moreover  the federal reserve will closely scrutinize any dividend payout ratios exceeding percent of after tax net income 
additionally  while the impact of many of its provisions are not yet known  the dodd frank act requires federal banking agencies to establish more stringent risk based capital guidelines and leverage limits applicable to banks and bank holding companies  and especially those institutions with consolidated assets equal to or greater than billion 
in august  the federal reserve  the fdic and the office of the comptroller of the currency jointly published three proposed rules that would substantially revise the federal banking agencies current capital rules and implement the basel committee on banking supervision s december regulatory capital reforms  known as basel iii 
the proposed rules  if adopted as proposed  could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends  or may result in additional limitations on our ability to pay dividends on shares of our capital stock 
pursuant to rules adopted in november  the federal reserve has required bank holding companies with billion or more of total consolidated assets  such as regions  to submit annual capital plans to the federal reserve for review before they can make capital distributions such as dividends 
the federal reserve did not object to regions capital plan that was submitted in january  however  if the federal reserve does not approve any subsequent regions capital plan  regions may not be able to declare dividends 
our management and board of directors  as part of the capital planning process  will continue to evaluate the payment of dividends in conjunction with our regulatory supervisors  and subject to applicable regulations and other limitations  as well as regions results of operations 
anti takeover laws and certain agreements and charter provisions may adversely affect share value 
certain provisions of state and federal law and our certificate of incorporation may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of us without our board of directors approval 
under federal law  subject to certain exemptions  a person  entity or group must notify the federal banking agencies before acquiring control of 
table of contents a bank holding company 
acquisition of percent or more of any class of voting stock of a bank holding company or state member bank  including shares of our common stock  creates a rebuttable presumption that the acquirer controls the bank holding company or state member bank 
also  as noted under the supervision and regulation section of item of this annual report on form k  a bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve before  among other things  acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than percent of the voting shares of any bank  including regions bank 
there also are provisions in our certificate of incorporation that may be used to delay or block a takeover attempt 
for example  holders of our series a preferred stock have certain voting rights that could adversely affect share value 
if and when dividends on the preferred stock have not been declared and paid for at least six quarterly dividend periods or their equivalent whether or not consecutive  the authorized number of directors then constituting our board of directors will automatically be increased by two  and the preferred stockholders will be entitled to elect the two additional directors 
also  the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two thirds of all of the then outstanding shares of the preferred stock is required to consummate a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the preferred stock  or a merger or consolidation of regions with or into another entity  unless certain requirements are met 
these statutory provisions and provisions in our certificate of incorporation  including the rights of the holders of our series a preferred stock  could result in regions being less attractive to a potential acquirer 
we may need to raise additional debt or equity capital in the future  such capital may be dilutive to our existing shareholders or may not be available when needed or at all 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on  among other things  conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside of our control  and our financial performance 
the economic slowdown and loss of confidence in financial institutions over the past several years may increase our cost of funding and limit our access to some of our customary sources of capital  including inter bank borrowings  repurchase agreements and borrowings from the discount window of the federal reserve 
additionally  some of our long term debt securities are currently rated below investment grade by certain of the credit ratings agencies 
any such ratings may affect our cost of funding and limit our access to the capital markets 
we cannot assure you that capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital markets  such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers  depositors of regions bank or counterparties participating in the capital markets  or a downgrade of our debt ratings  may adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and  in turn  our liquidity 
an inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
future issuances of additional equity securities could result in dilution of existing stockholders equity ownership 
we may determine from time to time to issue additional equity securities to raise additional capital  support growth  or to make acquisitions 
further  we may issue stock options or other stock grants to retain and motivate our employees 
these issuances of our securities could dilute the voting and economic interests of our existing shareholders

currently  the minimum guidelines to be considered well capitalized for tier i capital and total capital are percent and percent  respectively 
at december   regions tier capital and total capital ratios were percent and percent respectively 
in addition  the federal reserve and banking regulators routinely supplement their assessment of capital adequacy based on a variation of tier capital  know as tier common equity non gaap 
although federal banking regulators have not established minimum guidelines to be considered well capitalized  the tier common equity ratio has been a key component in assessing capital adequacy under the comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar process 
at december   regions tier common equity ratio was percent 
in november  the federal reserve  the federal deposit insurance corp 
and the office of the comptroller of the currency announced the guidelines for the ccar review  the results of which will be released in march in addition  in the basel committee released basel iii  its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulations 
the framework requires bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital  with a greater emphasis on common equity 
subsequently  in june  the federal reserve  the fdic  and the office of the comptroller of the currency issued proposed rules implementing the capital provisions set forth by the basel iii framework 
regions is in the process of evaluating the anticipated impact of the proposed rules for implementing basel iii  which will be phased in beginning in and is expected to be fully phased in by january  based on regions current understanding of the basel iii requirements  the company s estimated basel iii tier common ratio non gaap as of december  was approximately percent  exceeding the basel iii minimum of percent for tier i common non gaap 
similarly  based on regions current understanding of the proposed rules related to the calculation of the liquidity coverage ratio lcr under basel iii  the company anticipates being fully compliant upon finalization and implementation

table of contents credit risk section of md a note allowance for credit losses to the consolidated financial statements net interest income  margin and interest rate risk in  the net interest margin from continuing operations expanded to percent from percent in  largely due to a mix shift from time deposits to lower cost deposit products  resulting in deposit costs decreasing to percent in from percent in taxable equivalent net interest income decreased million to billion in  due primarily to a reduction in average earning assets from billion in to billion in despite the continued improvements in deposit costs and mix  the margin and net interest income continue to be negatively affected by a sustained low interest rate  low growth environment 
reductions in average loans contributed to the decline in average earning assets and net interest income  partially offset by an increase in average securities from billion in to billion in the company s securities yield declined basis points driven by higher prepayments in the residential mortgage backed securities portfolio and reinvestment of proceeds into lower yielding securities 
loan yields  however  remained relatively stable at percent as the company began to see the benefits from migrating toward more consumer products  such as expanding indirect auto lending and re entering credit cards  as well as reductions in the company s level of non accrual loans 
if current economic conditions persist into  growing net interest income and the resulting net interest margin will continue to be challenging 
however  management believes opportunities exist to maintain a relatively stable margin through further reducing deposit costs and additional liability management actions 
regions balance sheet is in a moderately asset sensitive position such that if economic conditions were to improve more rapidly  thereby resulting in a rise in interest rates  the net interest margin would likely respond favorably

regions profitability  like that of many other financial institutions  is dependent on its ability to generate revenue from net interest income and non interest income sources 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income regions receives on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest expense regions pays on interest bearing liabilities  principally deposits and borrowings 
regions net interest income is impacted by the size and mix of its balance sheet components and the interest rate spread between interest earned on its assets and interest paid on its liabilities 
non interest income includes fees from service charges on deposit accounts  mortgage servicing and secondary marketing  trust and asset management activities  insurance activities  capital markets and other customer services  which regions provides 
results of operations are also affected by the provision for loan losses and non interest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits  occupancy  professional fees  fdic insurance  other real estate owned and other operating expenses  as well as income taxes

table of contents overview regions reported net income available to common shareholders of million or per diluted common share in credit related costs  primarily the loan loss provision  declined significantly in as a result of improvements in the credit environment 
average low cost deposits grew percent leading to a decline in both s total deposit and funding costs 
net interest income from continuing operations remained stable at billion in the net interest margin from continuing operations taxable equivalent basis was percent in  compared to percent during  primarily due to a reduction in average earning assets 
net interest income was driven primarily by a decrease of basis points in the cost of interest bearing liabilities  while being partially offset by a basis point decline in the overall yield on interest earning assets 
this dynamic reflected efforts to improve deposit costs and pricing on loans  while managing the challenges posed by a low interest rate environment 
long term interest rates in particular remained low in  pressuring yields on fixed rate loan and securities portfolios  and contributed to the decline in the yield on taxable securities from percent in to percent in the overall costs of deposits improved from percent in to percent in  as short term interest rates for example  the federal funds rate remained at historical lows 
the product mix of deposits improved as well  as declines in higher cost certificates of deposits accompanied increases in low cost checking and savings products 
if current economic conditions persist into  growing net interest income and the resulting net interest margin will be challenging 
however  management believes opportunities exist to stabilize the margin through further reducing deposit costs and additional liability management actions 
regions balance sheet is in a moderately asset sensitive position such that if economic conditions were to improve more rapidly  thereby resulting in a rise in interest rates  the net interest margin would likely respond favorably 
net charge offs totaled billion  or percent of average loans in compared to billion  or percent of average loans in net charge offs were lower across most major categories when comparing to the prior year 
non performing assets decreased billion to billion at december  the provision for loan losses is used to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that  in management s judgment  is appropriate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
during  the provision for loan losses decreased to million compared to billion in the allowance for loan losses was billion  or percent of loans  at december  as compared to billion  or percent of loans  at december  net charge offs exceeded provision for loan losses for due to improving credit metrics  including lower non accrual  criticized and classified loan balances  and delinquencies  as well as a decline in overall loan balances 
non interest income from continuing operations decreased million to billion in compared to the year over year decrease was due primarily to lower securities gains and service charges  partially offset by increased mortgage income and investment fee income 
see table non interest income for further details 
non interest expense from continuing operations totaled billion and billion in and  respectively 
non interest expense included a million goodwill impairment charge in the period included an increase in salaries and employee benefits due to higher pension costs  annual merit increases and incentive increases  including mortgage related incentives  lower occupancy expense and lower credit related costs 
see table  non interest expense from continuing operations for further details 
total loans decreased by billion  or percent in  driven primarily by a continued run off of balances related to investor real estate 
decreases in residential first mortgage and home equity loans also contributed to the year over year decrease primarily resulting from consumers decisions to de leverage 
these 
table of contents decreases were partially offset by growth in the commercial and industrial category and record growth in indirect loans 
total deposits decreased million in to billion at december   and low cost customer deposits increased billion  or percent  in regions tier common non gaap ratio was percent at december  the corresponding basel iii tier common ratio non gaap  based on regions current understanding of the guidelines  was approximately percent  which exceeds the basel iii minimum of percent see table  gaap to non gaap reconciliation for a reconciliation of the non gaap measures to the corresponding gaap or regulatory measure 
table gaap to non gaap reconciliation presents computations of earnings loss and certain other financial measures  which exclude certain significant items that are included in financial results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these non gaap financial measures include fee income ratio  efficiency ratio  return on average assets from continuing operations  return on average tangible common stockholders equity  end of period and average tangible common stockholders equity  tier common equity  and basel iii tier common equity and related ratios 
regions believes that the exclusion of these significant items in expressing earnings and certain other financial measures provides a meaningful base for period to period comparisons  which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the company and predicting future performance 
these non gaap financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of regions business because management does not consider these charges to be as relevant to ongoing operating results 
management and the board of directors utilize these non gaap financial measures as follows preparation of regions operating budgets monthly financial performance reporting monthly close out reporting of consolidated results management only presentations to investors of company performance the efficiency ratio non gaap  which is a measure of productivity  is generally calculated as non interest expense divided by total revenue on a taxable equivalent basis 
the fee income ratio non gaap is generally calculated as non interest income divided by total revenue 
management uses these ratios to monitor performance and believes these measures provide meaningful information to investors 
non interest expense gaap is presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted non interest expense non gaap  which is the numerator for the efficiency ratio 
non interest income gaap is presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted non interest income non gaap  which is the numerator for the fee income ratio 
net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis and non interest income gaap are added together to arrive at total revenue gaap 
adjustments are made to arrive at adjusted total revenue non gaap  which is the denominator for the fee income and efficiency ratios 
regions believes that the non gaap measures reflecting these adjustments provide a meaningful base for period to period comparisons  which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the company and predicting future performance 
these non gaap financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of regions business 
it is possible that the activities related to the adjustments may recur  however  management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments to be indications of ongoing operations 
regions believes that presentation of these non gaap financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the company on the same basis as that applied by management 
tangible common stockholders equity ratios have become a focus of some investors in analyzing the capital position of the company absent the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock 
traditionally  the federal reserve and other banking regulatory bodies have assessed a bank s capital adequacy based on tier capital  the calculation of which is codified in federal banking regulations 
in connection with the federal reserve s comprehensive capital analysis and review process  these regulators are supplementing their 
table of contents assessment of the capital adequacy of a bank based on a variation of tier capital  known as tier common equity 
while not prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations  analysts and banking regulators have assessed regions capital adequacy using the tangible common stockholders equity and or the tier common equity measure 
because tangible common stockholders equity and tier common equity are not formally defined by gaap or prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations  these measures are considered to be non gaap financial measures and other entities may calculate them differently than regions disclosed calculations 
since analysts and banking regulators may assess regions capital adequacy using tangible common stockholders equity and tier common equity  regions believes that it is useful to provide investors the ability to assess regions capital adequacy on these same bases 
tier common equity is often expressed as a percentage of risk weighted assets 
under the risk based capital framework  a bank s balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are assigned to one of four broad risk categories 
the aggregated dollar amount in each category is then multiplied by the risk weighting assigned to that category 
the resulting weighted values from each of the four categories are added together and this sum is the risk weighted assets total that  as adjusted  comprises the denominator of certain risk based capital ratios 
tier capital is then divided by this denominator risk weighted assets to determine the tier capital ratio 
adjustments are made to tier capital to arrive at tier common equity non gaap 
tier common equity is also divided by the risk weighted assets to determine the tier common equity ratio 
the amounts disclosed as risk weighted assets are calculated consistent with banking regulatory requirements 
regions currently calculates its risk based capital ratios under guidelines adopted by the federal reserve based on the capital accord basel i of the basel committee on banking supervision the basel committee 
in december  the basel committee released its final framework for basel iii  which will strengthen international capital and liquidity regulations 
when implemented by us bank regulatory agencies and fully phased in  basel iii will change capital requirements and place greater emphasis on common equity 
the federal reserve has announced a delay in the implementation date of the final rules 
however  when implemented there will be a phase in period of up to years 
the us bank regulatory agencies have not yet finalized regulations governing the implementation of basel iii 
accordingly  the calculations provided below are estimates  based on regions current understanding of the framework  including the company s reading of the original requirements  as well as the us notices of proposed rulemaking npr released in june  and informal feedback received through the regulatory process 
regions understanding of the framework is evolving and will likely change as the regulations are finalized 
the npr comment period ended in october  changes to the calculation resulting from the comment process could result in materially different capital ratios from the amounts estimated 
because the basel iii implementation regulations are not formally defined by gaap and have not yet been finalized and codified  these measures are considered to be non gaap financial measures  and other entities may calculate them differently from regions disclosed calculations 
since analysts and banking regulators may assess regions capital adequacy using the basel iii framework  regions believes that it is useful to provide investors information enabling them to assess regions capital adequacy on the same basis 
non gaap financial measures have inherent limitations  are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited 
although these non gaap financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company  they have limitations as analytical tools  and should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap 
in particular  a measure of earnings that excludes selected items does not represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to stockholders ie  reit investment early termination costs  merger related charges  goodwill impairment and regulatory charge and related tax benefit are a reduction to earnings and stockholders equity

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing financial information  management is required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  income and expenses for the periods shown 
the accounting principles followed by regions and the methods of applying these principles conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the us and general banking practices 
estimates and assumptions most significant to regions are related primarily to the allowance for credit losses  fair value measurements  intangible assets goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets  mortgage servicing rights and income taxes  and are summarized in the following discussion and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses allowance consists of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments 
these two components reflect management s judgment of probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio and unfunded credit commitments at the balance sheet date 
a full discussion of these estimates and other factors is included in the allowance for credit losses section within the discussion of credit risk  found in a later section of this report  note summary of significant accounting policies  and note allowance for credit losses to the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance is sensitive to a variety of internal factors  such as portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings  as well as external factors  such as interest rates and the general health of the economy 
management reviews different assumptions for variables that could result in increases or decreases in probable inherent credit losses  which may materially impact regions estimate of the allowance and results of operations 
management s estimate of the allowance for the commercial and investor real estate portfolio segments could be affected by estimates of losses inherent in various product types as a result of fluctuations in the general economy  developments within a particular industry  or changes in an individual s credit due to factors particular to that credit  such as competition  management or business performance 
for non accrual commercial and investor real estate loans equal to or greater than million  the allowance for loan losses is based on specific evaluation considering the facts and circumstances specific to each borrower 
for all other commercial and investor real estate loans  the allowance for loan losses is based on statistical models using a probability of default pd and a loss given default lgd 
historical default information for similar loans is used as an input for the statistical model 
a percent increase in the pd for non defaulted accounts and a percent increase in the lgd for all accounts would result in an increase to estimated losses of approximately million 
for residential real estate mortgages  home equity lending and other consumer related loans  individual products are reviewed on a group basis or in loan pools eg  residential real estate mortgage pools 
losses can be affected by such factors as collateral value  loss severity  the economy and other uncontrollable factors 
a percent increase or decrease in the estimated loss rates on these loans would change estimated inherent losses by approximately million 
additionally  the estimate of the allowance for the entire portfolio may change due to modifications in the mix and level of loan balances outstanding and general economic conditions  as evidenced by changes in real estate demand and values  interest rates  unemployment rates  bankruptcy filings  fluctuations in the gross domestic product  and the effects of weather and natural disasters such as droughts and hurricanes 
each has the ability to result in actual loan losses that could differ from originally estimated amounts 
the pro forma inherent loss analysis presented above demonstrates the sensitivity of the allowance to key assumptions 
this sensitivity analysis does not reflect an expected outcome

table of contents fair value measurements a portion of the company s assets and liabilities is carried at fair value  with changes in fair value recorded either in earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
these include trading account assets and liabilities  securities available for sale  mortgage loans held for sale  mortgage servicing rights and derivative assets and liabilities 
from time to time  the estimation of fair value also affects other loans held for sale  which are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value 
fair value determination is also relevant for certain other assets such as foreclosed property and other real estate  which are recorded at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan property or fair value  less estimated costs to sell the property 
for example  the fair value of other real estate is determined based on recent appraisals by third parties and other market information  less estimated selling costs 
adjustments to the appraised value are made if management becomes aware of changes in the fair value of specific properties or property types 
the determination of fair value also impacts certain other assets that are periodically evaluated for impairment using fair value estimates  including goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 
fair value is generally defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price as opposed to the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability an entry price  in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions 
while management uses judgment when determining the price at which willing market participants would transact when there has been a significant decrease in the volume or level of activity for the asset or liability in relation to normal market activity  management s objective is to determine the point within the range of fair value estimates that is most representative of a sale to a third party investor under current market conditions 
the value to the company if the asset or liability were held to maturity is not included in the fair value estimates 
a fair value measure should reflect the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  including the assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique  the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset and the risk of nonperformance 
fair value is measured based on a variety of inputs the company utilizes 
fair value may be based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets level valuations 
if market prices are not available  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market are used level valuations 
where observable market data is not available  the valuation is generated from model based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market  but observable based on company specific data level valuations 
these unobservable assumptions reflect the company s own estimates for assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
valuation techniques typically include option pricing models  discounted cash flow models and similar techniques  but may also include the use of market prices of assets or liabilities that are not directly comparable to the subject asset or liability 
see note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of determining fair value  including pricing validation processes 
intangible assets regions intangible assets consist primarily of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of acquired businesses goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets primarily core deposit intangibles and purchased credit card relationships 
goodwill totaled billion at december  and december  and is allocated to each of regions reportable segments each a reporting unit  at which level goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of october or more often if events and circumstances indicate impairment may exist refer to note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of when regions tests goodwill for impairment 
as further discussed in note business segment information  regions reorganized its management reporting structure during the third quarter of 
table of contents and  accordingly  its segment reporting structure and goodwill reporting units 
in connection with the reorganization  management reallocated goodwill to the new reporting units using a relative fair value approach 
a test of goodwill for impairment consists of two steps 
in step one  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
to the extent that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value  impairment is not indicated and no further testing is required 
conversely  if the fair value of the reporting unit is below its carrying amount  step two must be performed 
step two consists of determining the implied fair value of goodwill  which is the net difference between the valuation adjustments of assets and liabilities and the valuation adjustment to equity from step one of the reporting unit 
the carrying value of equity for each reporting unit is determined from an allocation based upon risk weighted assets 
adverse changes in the economic environment  declining operations of the reporting unit  or other factors could result in a decline in the estimated implied fair value of goodwill 
if the estimated implied fair value is less than the carrying amount  a loss would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount to the estimated implied fair value 
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is determined using two approaches and several key assumptions 
regions utilizes the capital asset pricing model capm in order to derive the base discount rate 
the inputs to the capm include the year risk free rate  year beta for a select peer set  and the market risk premium based on published data 
once the output of the capm is determined  a size premium is added also based on a published source as well as a company specific risk premium  which is an estimate determined by the company and meant to compensate for the risk inherent in the future cash flow projections and inherent differences such as business model and market perception of risk between regions and the peer set 
the table below summarizes the discount rate used in the goodwill impairment test of each reporting unit for the third and fourth quarters of business services consumer services wealth management discount rate th quarter rd quarter the table below summarizes the discount rate used in the goodwill impairment tests of the former banking treasury reporting unit for the reporting periods indicated nd quarter st quarter th quarter rd quarter discount rate in estimating future cash flows  a balance sheet as of the test date and a statement of operations for the last twelve months of activity for each reporting unit are compiled 
from that point  future balance sheets and statements of operations are projected based on the inputs discussed below 
cash flows are based on expected future capitalization requirements due to balance sheet growth and anticipated changes in regulatory capital requirements 
the baseline cash flows utilized in all models correspond to the most recent internal forecasts and or budgets that range from to years 
these internal forecasts are based on inputs developed in the company s capital planning processes 
regions uses the guideline public company method and the guideline transaction method as the two market approaches 
the public company method applies a value multiplier derived from each reporting unit s peer group to tangible book value or earnings for wealth management and an implied control premium to the respective reporting unit 
the control premium is evaluated and compared to similar financial services transactions considering the absolute and relative potential revenue synergies and cost savings 
the transaction method applies a value multiplier to a financial metric of the reporting unit based on comparable observed purchase transactions in the financial services industry for the reporting unit where available 

table of contents refer to the discussion of intangible assets in note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these approaches and note intangible assets for a discussion of the assumptions 
the fair values of assets and liabilities are determined using an exit price concept 
refer to note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for discussions of the exit price concept and the determination of fair values of financial assets and liabilities 
throughout and in the former banking treasury reporting unit  the credit quality of regions loan portfolio declined  which contributed to increased losses as well as elevated non performing loan levels 
accordingly  regions performed tests of goodwill for impairment during each quarter of and during the second  third and fourth quarters of in a manner consistent with the test conducted in the fourth quarter of while credit quality has improved  regions continued to perform its goodwill impairment tests during the four quarters of and the first two quarters of  in a manner consistent with the tests conducted in prior periods  primarily due to the company s market capitalization remaining below book value 
as a result of the management reporting changes described above  regions revised its reportable segments and  consequently  its reporting units from the three segments previously reported and reallocated goodwill to the new reporting units based on the relative fair values of the revised reporting units 
the long term fair value of equity was determined using both income and market approaches referenced above and discussed in note intangible assets 
the results of these calculations indicated that the estimated fair value of the wealth management reporting unit was greater than its carrying amount and the estimated fair values of the business services and consumer services reporting units were less than their respective carrying amounts 
at october   the carrying amount and estimated fair value of the business services reporting unit were billion and billion  respectively  while the carrying amount of goodwill for the reporting unit was billion 
at october   the carrying amount and estimated fair value of the consumer services reporting unit were billion and billion respectively  while the carrying amount of goodwill for the reporting unit was billion 
therefore  step two of the goodwill impairment test was performed for both the business services and consumer services reporting units 
in step two  the fair values of each reporting unit s assets  both tangible and intangible  and liabilities were determined using estimates of the amounts at which the assets or liabilities could be bought or incurred or sold settled in a taxable transaction between willing participants 
for the business services and consumer services reporting units  the effects of the step two adjustments  which were primarily write downs of assets to fair value  exceeded any reductions in the value of common equity determined in step one  accordingly the calculation of implied goodwill exceeded its carrying amount 
therefore  the results were no impairment for the business services and consumer services reporting units  whose implied fair value of goodwill exceeded their carrying amounts by approximately percent and percent  respectively  as of october  specific factors as of the date of filing the financial statements that could negatively impact the assumptions used in assessing goodwill for impairment include a protracted decline in the company s market capitalization  disparities in the level of fair value changes in net assets especially loans compared to equity  increases in book values of equity of a reporting unit in excess of the increase in fair value of equity  adverse business trends resulting from litigation and or regulatory actions  higher loan losses  lengthened forecasts of higher unemployment relative to pre crisis levels beyond  future increased minimum regulatory capital requirements above current thresholds refer to note regulatory capital requirements and restrictions for a discussion of current minimum regulatory requirements  future federal rules and regulations resulting from the dodd frank act  and or a protraction in the current low level of interest rates significantly beyond the following tables present an analysis of independent changes in market factors and significant assumptions that could adversely impact the carrying balance of goodwill in the business services reporting unit 
due to the magnitude of the excess of the consumer services reporting unit s implied fair value of goodwill over its carrying amount  no such table has been included for this reporting unit 

table of contents impact to the carrying value of goodwill business services reporting unit change in discount rate estimated amount of impairment in millions from to a improvement in loan fair values b percentage points a percentage points percentage points a represents the point at which the implied fair value of goodwill would approximate its carrying value 
b business services loan discount to fair value is 
the sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future performance 
changes in implied fair value based on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear 
also  the effect of an adverse variation in a particular assumption on the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated without changing any other assumption  while in reality changes in one factor may result in changes in another which may either magnify or counteract the effect of the change 
other identifiable intangible assets  primarily core deposit intangibles and credit card intangibles  are reviewed at least annually usually in the fourth quarter for events or circumstances which could impact the recoverability of the intangible asset 
these events could include loss of core deposits  significant losses of credit card accounts and or balances  increased competition or adverse changes in the economy 
to the extent an other identifiable intangible asset is deemed unrecoverable  an impairment loss would be recorded to reduce the carrying amount 
these events or circumstances  if they occur  could be material to regions operating results for any particular reporting period but the potential impact cannot be reasonably estimated 
mortgage servicing rights regions estimates the fair value of its mortgage servicing rights in order to record them at fair value on the balance sheet 
although sales of mortgage servicing rights do occur  mortgage servicing rights do not trade in an active market with readily observable market prices and the exact terms and conditions of sales may not be readily available  and are therefore level valuations in the fair value hierarchy previously discussed in the fair value measurements section 
specific characteristics of the underlying loans greatly impact the estimated value of the related mortgage servicing rights 
as a result  regions stratifies its mortgage servicing portfolio on the basis of certain risk characteristics  including loan type and contractual note rate  and values its mortgage servicing rights using discounted cash flow modeling techniques 
these techniques require management to make estimates regarding future net servicing cash flows  taking into consideration historical and forecasted mortgage loan prepayment rates  discount rates  escrow balances and servicing costs 
changes in interest rates  prepayment speeds or other factors impact the fair value of mortgage servicing rights which impacts earnings 
based on a hypothetical sensitivity analysis  regions estimates that a reduction in primary mortgage market rates of basis points and basis points would reduce the december  fair value of mortgage servicing rights by approximately percent million and percent million  respectively 
conversely  basis point and basis point increases in these rates would increase the december  fair value of mortgage servicing rights by approximately percent million and percent million  respectively 
regions also estimates that an increase in servicing costs of approximately per loan  or percent  would result in a decline in the value of the mortgage servicing rights by approximately million or basis points 

table of contents the pro forma fair value analysis presented above demonstrates the sensitivity of fair values to hypothetical changes in primary mortgage rates 
this sensitivity analysis does not reflect an expected outcome 
refer to the mortgage servicing rights discussion in the balance sheet analysis section found later in this report 
income taxes accrued income taxes are reported as a component of either other assets or other liabilities  as appropriate  in the consolidated balance sheets and reflect management s estimate of income taxes to be paid or received 
deferred income taxes represent the amount of future income taxes to be paid or received and are accounted for using the asset and liability method 
the net balance is reported in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company determines the realization of the deferred tax asset based upon an evaluation of the four possible sources of taxable income the future reversals of taxable temporary differences  future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  taxable income in prior carryback years  and tax planning strategies 
in projecting future taxable income  the company utilizes forecasted pre tax earnings  adjusts for the estimated book tax differences and incorporates assumptions  including the amounts of income allocable to taxing jurisdictions 
these assumptions require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates the company uses to manage the underlying businesses 
the realization of the deferred tax assets could be reduced in the future if these estimates are significantly different than forecasted 
for a detailed discussion of realization of deferred tax assets  refer to the income taxes section found later in this report 
the company is subject to income tax in the us and multiple state and local jurisdictions 
the tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction may be interpreted differently in certain situations  which could result in a range of outcomes 
thus  the company is required to exercise judgment regarding the application of these tax laws and regulations 
the company will evaluate and recognize tax liabilities related to any tax uncertainties 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities 
the company s estimate of accrued income taxes  deferred income taxes and income tax expense can also change in any period as a result of new legislative or judicial guidance impacting tax positions  as well as changes in income tax rates 
any changes  if they occur  can be significant to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
operating results general for  regions reported net income available to common shareholders of million  or per diluted common share 
in january  regions entered into an agreement to sell morgan keegan to raymond james financial  inc the results of the entities sold are presented as discontinued operations 
refer to note discontinued operations of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
regions reported net income from continuing operations available to common shareholders of  million  or per diluted common share in regions net loss from discontinued operations was million  or per diluted common share 
regions results from continuing operations reflected a significant decline in its provision for loan losses resulting from continued improving credit metrics and lower non interest expenses due to a million non cash goodwill impairment charge in regions also experienced lower net interest income as a result of a decline in interest earning asset levels combined with lower earning asset yields  as well as  slightly lower non interest income 

table of contents net interest income and margin net interest income interest income less interest expense is regions principal source of income and is one of the most important elements of regions ability to meet its overall performance goals 
net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis decreased approximately million  or percent in  from driven by a percent decrease in the level of average earning assets  from billion in to billion in the net interest margin increased to percent in from percent in  reflecting a favorable mix shift in deposits out of higher cost time deposits into low cost checking  savings and money market accounts 
comparing to  interest earning asset yields were lower  decreasing basis points on average 
however  interest bearing liability rates were also lower  declining by basis points  more than offsetting the drop in interest earning asset yields 
as a result  the net interest rate spread increased basis points to percent in compared to percent in continued low levels of long term interest rates affected interest earning asset yields through their influence on the behavior and pricing of both variable rate and fixed rate loans and securities 
monetary policy action pursued by the federal reserve  as well as a modest pace of economic recovery resulted in sustained low levels of both long and short term interest rates in the yield on the benchmark year us treasury note  particularly in the second half of  fluctuated mainly in the range of percent to percent  which is approximately basis points lower than in the level of long term rates has precipitated higher levels of prepayment  particularly in fixed rate loans and securities  which can result in the replacement of these assets at lower rates of interest 
this pressure impacts portfolios that have a significant concentration of fixed rate loans 
for example  the taxable investment securities portfolio  which contains significant residential fixed rate exposure  decreased in yield from percent in to percent in the negative influence of low  long term interest rates on the net interest margin  however  was offset by improvements in liability costs 
the federal reserve s rate of interest on excess reserves and the prime rate  which are influential drivers of loan and deposit pricing on the shorter end of the yield curve  remained low at approximately percent and percent  respectively  throughout  which was essentially unchanged from the previous year end level 
the company s loan pricing is also influenced by the day london interbank offering rate libor  which  on average was basis points with short term interest rates remaining low  deposit costs improved considerably from percent in to percent in there was substantial improvement in costs in every deposit category  including average money market accounts which declined from percent to percent 
the improvement in overall deposit costs was also attributable to a less costly mix of deposits 
for example  average time deposits declined from billion  or percent of total average deposits  in to billion  or percent of total average deposits  in meanwhile  average non interest bearing customer deposits increased from billion in to billion in net interest margin was also supported by a favorable shift of funding to customer deposits from more costly long term borrowings 
average long term borrowings declined to billion in as compared to billion in

the mix of interest earning assets can also affect the interest rate spread 
regions primary types of interest earning assets are loans and investment securities 
certain types of interest earning assets have historically generated larger spreads  for example  loans typically generate larger spreads than other assets  such as securities  federal funds sold or securities purchased under agreements to resell 
the spread on loans remained depressed in due to the low interest rate environment and an elevated level of loans on non accrual status 
average 
table of contents interest earning assets at december  totaled billion  a decrease of billion as compared to the prior year 
while average earning assets declined during  the mix changed somewhat  reflecting higher securities balances and a decline in average loans due to muted loan demand  consumer deleveraging and run off of investor real estate 
also affecting the interest rate spread and the net interest margin were continued elevated balances of interest bearing deposits in other banks included in other interest earning assets in table  primarily the federal reserve bank  as a result of the company s liquidity management process 
these funds generate a significantly lower spread than loans or securities 
the levels of cash reserves negatively impacted the net interest margin by basis points in and basis points in in addition  overall levels of non performing assets negatively impacted the net interest margin by basis points in compared to basis points in average loans as a percentage of average interest earning assets were percent in and percent in the categories  which consist of interest earning assets  are shown in table consolidated average daily balances and yield rate analysis for continuing operations 
the proportion of average interest earning assets to average total assets which was percent and percent in and in  respectively  measures the effectiveness of management s efforts to invest available funds into the most profitable interest earning vehicles 
this measure was consistent with the prior year as the overwhelming majority of the decline in total assets in was in interest earning assets 
funding for regions interest earning assets comes from interest bearing and non interest bearing sources 
another significant factor affecting the net interest margin is the percentage of interest earning assets funded by interest bearing liabilities 
the percentage of average interest earning assets funded by average interest bearing liabilities was percent in and percent in  reflecting growth in non interest bearing deposits 
table volume and yield rate variances from continuing operations provides additional information with which to analyze the changes in net interest income 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is used to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that  in management s judgment  is appropriate to absorb probable losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date 
during  the provision for loan losses was million and net charge offs were billion 
this compares to a provision for loan losses of billion and net charge offs of billion in net charge offs exceeded the provision for loan losses during primarily resulting from the continued improving credit metrics  including lower levels of non accrual loans and criticized and classified loans  as well as an overall reduction in loan balances  problem loan resolutions and a continuing mix shift in loans out of higher risk investor real estate and into less risky commercial and industrial loans

table of contents at december   the company reported a net deferred tax asset of million compared to billion at december  the change is principally due to a decrease in the allowance for loan losses and utilization of tax credit carryforwards 
of the balance at december   million was generated from differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the corresponding tax bases of assets and liabilities  of which a significant portion relates to the allowance for loan losses 
these net deferred tax assets have not yet reduced taxable income and therefore do not have a set expiration date 
the remaining million net deferred tax asset balance relates to tax carryforwards that have defined expiration dates which are typically or years from the date of creation 
of the million  million of this deferred tax asset is related to tax carryforwards that have expiration dates prior to the tax year the company continually assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets based on an evaluative process that considers all available positive and negative evidence 
the company has established a valuation allowance in the amount of million at december  and million at december  because the company believes that a portion of the state operating loss carryforwards and state tax credit carryforwards will not be utilized 
as part of this evaluative process  management considers the following sources of taxable income the future reversals of taxable temporary differences  future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  taxable income in prior carryback years  and tax planning strategies 
in making a conclusion  management has evaluated all available positive and negative evidence impacting these sources of taxable income 
the primary sources of evidence impacting management s judgment regarding the realization of the company s deferred tax assets are summarized below 
history of earnings as of december   the company has reestablished a positive earnings trend and is not in a three year cumulative loss position 
therefore  the company no longer has this negative evidence to consider in the valuation of its deferred tax assets 
the company did not generate any federal net operating losses or tax credit carryforwards until  and in the company utilized all federal net operating losses 
in  the company utilized a significant portion of its federal tax credit carryforwards 
there is no history of significant tax carryforwards expiring unused 
reversals of taxable temporary differences the company anticipates that future reversals of taxable temporary differences  including the accretion of taxable temporary differences related to leveraged leases acquired in a prior business combination  can absorb up to approximately million of deferred tax assets 
creation of future taxable income the company has projected future taxable income that will be sufficient to absorb the remaining deferred tax assets after the reversal of future taxable temporary differences 
the taxable income forecasting process utilizes the forecasted pre tax earnings and adjusts for book tax differences that will be exempt from taxation  primarily tax exempt interest income and bank owned life insurance  as well as temporary book tax differences including the allowance for loan losses 
the projections relied upon for this process are consistent with those used in the company s financial forecasting process 
ability to implement tax planning strategies the company has the ability to implement tax planning strategies to maximize the realization of deferred tax assets  such as the sale of assets 
as an example  at december   the company s portfolio of securities available for sale had million of gross unrealized pre tax gains which could accelerate the recognition of the associated taxable temporary differences  which management would consider being a tax planning strategy to maximize the realization of the deferred tax assets that may expire unutilized 
the company completed the sale of morgan keegan and related affiliates to raymond james on april  the company has reflected the transaction as if raymond james purchased the assets of the entities for tax purposes and in january  income tax elections were finalized that are consistent with this treatment 
the company s effective tax rate is affected by recurring items such as affordable housing tax credits  bank owned life insurance and tax exempt income  which are expected to be consistent in the near term 
the effective 
table of contents tax rate is also affected by items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period to period  such as the termination of certain leveraged leases 
accordingly  future period effective tax rates may not be comparable to the current period

balance sheet analysis at december   regions reported total assets of billion compared to billion at the end of  a decrease of approximately billion or percent 
the decrease in total assets from year end resulted mainly from a decrease in loans  as well as a decrease in other assets 
loans  net of unearned income  declined approximately billion  primarily related to the investor real estate portfolio segment 
other assets also declined between years due to decreases in derivative assets and deferred income tax assets  as well as settlements of securities sales 
also  a decrease in interest bearing deposits in other banks was largely offset by an increase in securities available for sale 
the decrease in total assets was also driven by a reduction in trading account assets  which resulted from the closing of the sale of morgan keegan see note discontinued operations to the consolidated financial statements

these purchases were partially offset by sales of approximately billion in available for sale mortgage backed securities  sales of approximately million in available for sale high quality investment grade corporate bonds  paydowns and maturities 
the net purchases of agency mortgage backed securities are an offset to the company s strategy to sell the majority of agency eligible residential first mortgages at origination  and the corporate bonds increase diversification in the portfolio with an attractive risk and return profile

regions manages loan growth with a focus on risk management and risk adjusted return on capital 
strategic decisions to reduce the concentration in investor real estate  continued run off of residential mortgage loans  and lower demand for home equity products were the primary contributors to the decrease

the following sections describe the composition of the portfolio segments and classes in table and explain variations in balances from the year end 
see note loans and note allowance for credit losses to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
commercial the commercial portfolio segment includes commercial and industrial loans to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs  equipment purchases and other expansion projects 
commercial and industrial loans have increased since due to regions integrated approach to specialized lending 
commercial also includes owner occupied commercial real estate loans to operating businesses  which are loans for long term financing of land and buildings  and are repaid by cash flow generated by business operations 
these loans declined from year end as a result of customer deleveraging 
owner occupied construction loans are made to commercial businesses for the development of land or construction of a building where the repayment is derived from revenues generated from the business of the borrower 
during  total commercial loan balances increased  million  or percent  driven by growth experienced in specialized industry groups 
investor real estate loans for real estate development are repaid through cash flow related to the operation  sale or refinance of the property 
this portfolio segment includes extensions of credit to real estate developers or investors where repayment is dependent on the sale of real estate or income generated from the real estate collateral 
a portion of regions investor real estate portfolio segment is comprised of loans secured by residential product types land  single family and condominium loans within regions markets 
additionally  this category includes loans made to finance income producing properties such as apartment buildings  office and industrial buildings  and retail shopping centers 
the investor real estate loan segment decreased billion from balances primarily due to continued payoffs  paydowns  and transfers to held for sale 
residential first mortgage residential first mortgage loans represent loans to consumers to finance a residence 
these loans are typically financed over a to year term and  in most cases  are extended to 
table of contents borrowers to finance their primary residence 
these loans experienced a billion decline to billion in  primarily due to consumer deleveraging 
however  mortgage origination volume increased to billion in as compared to billion in reflecting customers taking advantage of the opportunity to refinance under the extended home affordable refinance program  or harp ii 
a significant portion of mortgage originations were sold in the secondary market 
at the end of  regions began the process of retaining year fixed rate mortgage production on the balance sheet which should mitigate additional balance reductions going forward 
refer to note allowance for credit losses to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
home equity home equity lending includes both home equity loans and lines of credit 
this type of lending  which is secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower s residence  allows customers to borrow against the equity in their home 
substantially all of this portfolio was originated through regions branch network 
during  home equity balances decreased billion to billion  driven by consumer deleveraging and refinancing 
net charge offs within the home equity portfolio remain elevated  but decreased in as compared to most of the improvement in losses came from florida second liens because property values in florida markets have either stabilized or started to increase 
more information related to these developments is included in the home equity discussion below 
indirect indirect lending  which is lending initiated through third party business partners  is largely comprised of loans made through automotive dealerships 
this portfolio class increased million  or percent in  reflecting growth from the late re entry into the indirect auto lending business 
regions currently has over  dealers in its network 
consumer credit card during the second quarter of  regions completed the purchase of approximately billion of existing regions branded consumer credit card accounts from fia card services 
the products are primarily open ended variable interest rate consumer credit card loans 
in the third quarter of  regions assumed the servicing of these loans from fia card services 
other consumer other consumer loans include direct consumer installment loans  overdrafts and other revolving loans 
other consumer loans totaled billion at december   relatively unchanged from the prior year 
credit quality certain of regions loans have been particularly vulnerable to weak economic conditions over the past several years  mainly investor real estate loans and home equity products particularly florida second lien 
these loan types have a higher risk of non collection than other loans 
the following sections provide further detail on these portfolios 

table of contents investor real estate the following table presents the portions of the investor real estate portfolio segment as of december  table investor real estate analysis mortgage construction total percent of total on non accrual status dollars in billions retail multi family office industrial land single family hotel other condominium the following table presents the geographic distribution of the investor real estate portfolio segment as of december  table investor real estate ire by geography core state alabama arkansas florida georgia lousisana mississippi tennessee other of total ire retail multi family office industrial land single family hotel other condominium core state represents the state in which the underlying collateral is located 
home equity the home equity portfolio totaled billion at december  as compared to billion at december  substantially all of this portfolio was originated through regions branch network 
losses in this portfolio generally track overall economic conditions 
the main source of economic stress has been in florida  where residential property values have declined significantly while unemployment rates remain high 
losses in florida where regions is in a second lien position are higher than first lien losses 

table of contents the following tables provide details related to the home equity portfolio as follows table selected home equity portfolio information year ended december  florida all other states total st lien nd lien total st lien nd lien total st lien nd lien total dollars in millions balance net charge offs net charge off year ended december  florida all other states total st lien nd lien total st lien nd lien total st lien nd lien total dollars in millions balance net charge offs net charge off net charge off percentages are calculated on an annualized basis as a percent of average balances 
net charge offs were percent of home equity loans for the year ended december  compared to percent for the year ended december  losses in florida based credits remained at elevated levels  but the related net charge off percentage did decrease to percent for the year ended december  from percent for the year ended december  home equity losses have decreased during due to improvement in unemployment rates which  although high  are lower than prior levels 
tighter underwriting standards in place since and stabilizing home values in florida also are contributing to this improvement 
of the billion home equity portfolio at december   approximately billion were home equity lines of credit and billion were closed end home equity loans primarily originated as amortizing loans 
beginning in may  new home equity lines of credit have a year draw period and a year repayment period 
previously  the home equity lines of credit had a year term with a balloon payment upon maturity or a year draw period with a balloon payment upon maturity 
the term balloon payment means there are no principal payments required until the balloon payment is due for interest only lines of credit 
as of december   none of regions home equity lines of credit have converted to mandatory amortization under the contractual terms 
the majority of home equity lines of credit will either mature with a balloon payment or convert to amortizing status after fiscal year of the billion of home equity lines of credit as of december   approximately percent require monthly interest only payments while the remaining approximately percent require a payment equal to percent of the outstanding balance  which would include some principal repayment 
as of december   approximately percent of borrowers were only paying the minimum amount due on the home equity line 
in addition  approximately percent of the home equity lines of credit balances have the option to amortize either all or a portion of their balance 
as of december   approximately million of the home equity lines of credit balances have elected this option 

table of contents regions home equity loans have higher default and delinquency rates than home equity lines of credit  which is expected at origination of the loans  due to more stringent underwriting guidelines for a line of credit versus a loan reflecting the nature of the credit being extended 
therefore  home equity loans secured with a second lien are expected to and do have higher delinquency and loss rates than home equity lines of credit with a second lien 
in the current environment  second liens in areas experiencing declines in home prices since origination  such as florida  perform similar to an unsecured portfolio 
regions is unable to track payment status on first liens held by another institution  including payment status related to loan modifications 
when regions second lien position becomes delinquent  an attempt is made to contact the first lien holder and inquire as to the payment status of the first lien 
however  regions does not continuously monitor the payment status of the first lien position 
short sale offers and settlement agreements are often received by the home equity junior lien holders well before the loan balance reaches the delinquency threshold for charge off consideration  potentially resulting in a full balance payoff charge off 
regions is presently monitoring the status of all first lien position loans that the company owns or services and has a second lien  and is taking appropriate action when delinquent 
during  regions evaluated a means to monitor non regions serviced first liens using a third party service provider and found that the delinquency rates were not material 
other consumer credit quality data the company calculates an estimate of the current value of property secured as collateral for both home equity and residential first mortgage lending products current ltv 
the estimate is based on home price indices compiled by the federal housing finance agency fhfa 
the fhfa data indicates trends for metropolitan statistical areas msas 
regions uses the fhfa valuation trends from the msas in the company s footprint in its estimate 
the trend data is applied to the loan portfolios taking into account the age of the most recent valuation and geographic area 
the following table presents current ltv data for components of the residential mortgage and home equity classes of the consumer portfolio segment 
current ltv data for the remaining loans in the portfolio is not available  primarily because some of the loans are serviced by others 
data may also not be available due to mergers and systems integrations 
the amounts in the table represent the entire loan balance 
for purposes of the table below  if the loan balance exceeds the current estimated collateral  the entire balance is included in the above category  regardless of the amount of collateral available to partially offset the shortfall 
the balances in the above category as a percentage of the portfolio balances have remained constant at for residential first mortgage and for home equity portfolios as of december  and  respectively

table of contents allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan and credit commitment portfolios as of period end 
the allowance for credit losses consists of two components the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments 
management s assessment of the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is based on a combination of both of these components 
regions determines its allowance for credit losses in accordance with applicable accounting literature as well as regulatory guidance related to receivables and contingencies 
binding unfunded credit commitments include items such as letters of credit  financial guarantees and binding unfunded loan commitments 
additional discussion of the methodology used to calculate the allowance for credit losses is included in note allowance for credit losses to the consolidated financial statements  as well as related discussion in management s discussion and analysis 
the allowance for loan losses totaled billion at december  and billion at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of net loans was percent at december  and percent on december  the reserve for unfunded credit commitments was million at december  compared to million at december  net charge offs as a percentage of average loans were percent and percent in and  respectively 
net charge offs were lower across most categories  period over period  particularly in the case of commercial investor real estate mortgage as a result of the recent ongoing portfolio derisking and fundamental improvement in credit performance 
net charge offs increased period over period for the consumer credit card portfolio  which was purchased during the second quarter of in addition to lower levels of charge offs  credit quality metrics have improved during compared to  including lower levels of non accrual  criticized and classified loans  and lower inflows of non accrual loans 
the provision for loan losses totaled million for the year ended compared to billion for the year ended net charge offs exceeded the provision for loan losses for  primarily resulting from the continued improving credit metrics referred to above  as well as  an overall reduction in loan balances  problem loan resolutions and a continuing mix shift in loans out of higher risk investor real estate and into less risky commercial and industrial loans 
management considers the current level of allowance for credit losses appropriate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio and unfunded commitments 
management s determination of the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses requires the use of judgments and estimations that may change in the future 
changes in the factors used by management to determine the appropriateness of the allowance or the availability of new information could cause the allowance for credit losses to be increased or decreased in future periods 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies  as part of their examination process  may require changes in the level of the allowance based on their judgments and estimates 
given continued economic pressures and the anticipated slow economic recovery  management expects that net loan charge offs in will continue to improve compared to economic trends such as real estate valuations  interest rates and unemployment will impact the future levels of net charge offs and provision and may result in volatility from quarter to quarter during additionally  changes in circumstances related to individually large credits or certain portfolios may result in volatility 
details regarding the allowance and net charge offs  including an analysis of activity from the previous year s totals  are included in table allowance for credit losses

table of contents non performing assets totaled billion at december   compared to billion at december  foreclosed properties  a subset of non performing assets  totaled million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the decrease in non performing assets and foreclosed properties during reflects the company s efforts to work through problem assets and reduce the riskiest exposures 
based on current expectations for the economy  non performing assets are expected to improve in compared to economic trends such as real estate valuations  interest rates and unemployment  as well as the level of disposition activity  will impact the future level of non performing assets 
circumstances related to individually large credits may result in volatility throughout loans past due days or more and still accruing were million at december   a slight increase from million at december  at december   regions had approximately million of potential problem commercial and investor real estate loans that were not included in non accrual loans  but for which management had concerns as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with their present loan repayment terms 
this is a likely estimate of the amount of commercial and investor real estate loans that may migrate to non accrual status in the next quarter 
in order to arrive at the estimate of potential problem loans  personnel from geographic regions forecast certain larger dollar loans that may potentially be downgraded to non accrual at a future time  depending on the occurrence of future events 
these personnel consider a variety of factors  including the borrower s capacity and willingness to meet the contractual repayment terms  make principal curtailments or provide additional collateral when necessary  and provide current and complete financial information including global cash flows  contingent liabilities and sources of liquidity 
a probability weighting is assigned to the listing of loans due to the inherent level of uncertainty related to potential actions that a borrower or guarantor may take to prevent the loan from reaching problem status 
regions assigns the probability weighting based on an assessment of the likelihood that the necessary actions required to prevent problem loan status will occur 
additionally  for other loans for example  smaller dollar loans  a factor based on trends and experience is applied to determine the estimate of potential future downgrades 
because of the inherent uncertainty in forecasting future events  the estimate of potential problem loans ultimately represents the estimated aggregate dollar amounts of loans as opposed to an individual listing of loans 
the majority of the loans on which the potential problem loan estimate is based are classified as substandard accrual 
detailed disclosures for substandard accrual loans as well as other credit quality metrics are included in note allowance for credit losses to the consolidated financial statements

table of contents valuation adjustments are primarily recorded in other non interest expense  adjustments are also recorded as a charge to the allowance for loan losses if incurred within days after the date of transfer from loans

foreclosed property sold represents the net book value of the properties sold 
other assets other assets decreased billion to billion as of december  securities sold but not yet settled balances at the end of  which did not repeat in  and lower derivative assets primarily drove the decrease 
reduced foreclosed properties  deferred income taxes and prepaid expense balances also contributed to the year over year decrease 
deposits regions competes with other banking and financial services companies for a share of the deposit market 
regions ability to compete in the deposit market depends heavily on the pricing of its deposits and how effectively the company meets customers needs 
regions employs various means to meet those needs and enhance competitiveness  such as providing a high level of customer service  competitive pricing and providing convenient branch locations for its customers 
regions also serves customers through providing centralized  high quality banking services and alternative product delivery channels such as internet banking 
deposits are regions primary source of funds  providing funding for percent of average interest earning assets from continuing operations in and percent of average interest earning assets from continuing operations in table deposits details year over year deposits on a period ending basis 
total deposits at december   decreased approximately million compared to year end levels 
the overall decrease was driven by a significant decrease in time deposits 
this decrease was largely offset by increases in almost all categories of low cost deposits 
regions continued to focus on shifting the overall deposit mix toward low cost deposits  with an emphasis on non interest bearing demand and interest bearing transaction accounts  in an effort to reduce funding costs 
customer deposits  which exclude deposits used for wholesale funding purposes  decreased by percent to billion on an ending basis during due to liquidity in the market  regions has been able to steadily grow its low cost customer deposits and reduce its total deposit costs from percent in to percent in and to percent in table deposits in millions non interest bearing demand savings accounts interest bearing transaction accounts money market accounts domestic money market accounts foreign low cost deposits time deposits customer deposits corporate treasury time deposits prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period classification 
table of contents regions elected to exit the federal deposit insurance corporation s fdic transaction account guarantee tag program on july  the tag program was a component of the temporary liquidity guarantee program  whereby the fdic guaranteed all funds held at participating institutions beyond the  deposit insurance limit in qualifying transaction accounts 
regions decision to exit the program did not have a significant impact on liquidity 
when the dodd frank act was enacted in july  it permanently increased the fdic coverage limit to  also as a result of the dodd frank act  effective as of december   unlimited coverage for non interest bearing demand transaction accounts was provided until the expiration date of the program  which was january  in early  non interest bearing transaction accounts have declined  but the overall impact to deposit balances and liquidity has not been significant and is within expectations 
within customer deposits  non interest bearing demand deposits increased billion to billion  driven primarily by an increase in non interest bearing deposits from commercial and small businesses 
non interest bearing deposits accounted for approximately percent of total deposits at year end compared to percent at year end savings balances increased million to billion  generally reflecting continued consumer savings trends  spurred by economic uncertainty 
interest bearing transaction accounts increased billion to billion due to regions focus on shifting the mix of deposits 
interest bearing transaction deposits accounted for approximately percent of total deposits at year end compared to percent at year end domestic money market products  which exclude foreign money market accounts  are one of regions most significant funding sources 
these balances increased percent in to billion or percent of total deposits  compared to percent of total deposits in another reflection of the shifting in the mix of deposits 
included in customer time deposits are certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts 
the balance of customer time deposits decreased percent in to billion compared to billion in the decrease was primarily due to maturities with minimal reinvestment by customers as a result of the continued decline in rates offered on these products 
customer time deposits accounted for percent of total deposits in compared to percent in consistent with  total treasury deposits  which are used mainly for overnight funding purposes  remained at low levels in as the company continued to utilize customer based funding and other sources 
the company s choice of overnight funding sources is dependent on the company s particular funding needs and the relative attractiveness of each source 
the sensitivity of regions deposit rates to changes in market interest rates is reflected in regions average interest rate paid on interest bearing deposits 
the rate paid on interest bearing deposits decreased to percent in from percent in  driven by the expiration of time deposits  the positive mix shift to lower cost customer products  and continuation of the low interest rate environment throughout table maturity of time deposits of  or more presents maturities of time deposits of  or more at december  and table maturity of time deposits of  or more in millions time deposits of  or more  maturing in months or less over through months over through months over months

there are times when financing costs associated with these transactions are lower than typical repurchase agreement rates as a result of a supply and demand imbalance in particular collateral 
since short term repurchase agreement rates were close to zero during the last half of  the supply and demand imbalance related to securities that regions owned led to negative financing rates 
customer related borrowings short term borrowings that are the result of customer activity related to investment opportunities or brokerage interests totaled billion at december   compared to billion at december  the decrease between periods was due to decreased brokerage customer liabilities and short sale liabilities as a result of the sale of morgan keegan on april

at the end of each business day  customer balances are swept into the agreement account 
in exchange for cash  regions sells the customer securities with a commitment to repurchase them on the following business day 
the repurchase agreements are collateralized to allow for market fluctuations 
securities from regions bank s investment portfolio are used as collateral 
from the customer s perspective  the investment earns more than a traditional money market instrument 
from regions standpoint  the repurchase agreements are similar to deposit accounts  although they are not insured by the fdic or guaranteed by the united states or governmental agencies 
regions bank does not manage the level of these investments on a daily basis as the transactions are initiated by the customers 
the level of these borrowings can fluctuate significantly on a day to day basis 
long term borrowings regions long term borrowings consist primarily of fhlb borrowings  senior notes  subordinated notes and other long term notes payable 
total long term borrowings decreased billion to billion at december  at the parent company  the decrease resulted from the maturity of approximately million of subordinated and senior notes 
additionally at the parent company  million of junior subordinated notes were redeemed during resulting in an million loss on early extinguishment of debt 
at the bank level  approximately million of fhlb advances were prepaid during  realizing an immaterial pre tax loss on early extinguishment

see note long term borrowings to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion and detailed listing of outstandings and rates 
other liabilities other liabilities decreased million to billion as of december  the decrease was primarily driven by lower derivative liabilities and accrued employee benefit costs  as well as the reduction of a liability related to a third party investment in a reit as a result of an early termination of the investment 
these decreases were partially offset by the establishment of the indemnification obligation related to the sale of morgan keegan to raymond james

the increase between years was a result of the increase in common stockholders equity discussed above and a reduction in tangible assets 
regions annual dividend was per common share in  and regions understands the importance of returning capital to shareholders 
management will continue to execute the capital planning process  including evaluation of the amount of the common dividend  with the board of directors and in conjunction with regulatory supervisors  subject to the company s results of operations 
bank regulatory capital requirements regions and regions bank are required to comply with regulatory capital requirements established by federal and state banking agencies 
these regulatory capital requirements involve quantitative measures of the company s assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items  and also qualitative judgments by the regulators 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can subject the company to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory actions 
currently  there are two basic measures of capital adequacy a risk based measure and a leverage measure 
see note regulatory capital requirements and restrictions to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
in recent years  the federal reserve and banking regulators began supplementing their assessment of the capital adequacy of a bank based on a variation of tier capital  known as tier common equity 
this measure has been a key component of assessments of capital adequacy under the comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar process 
while not currently prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations  analysts and banking regulators have assessed regions capital adequacy using the tier common and or the tangible common stockholders equity measure 
because tangible common stockholders equity and tier common equity are not formally defined by gaap or prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations  these measures 
table of contents are considered to be non gaap financial measures and other entities may calculate them differently than regions disclosed calculations see table gaap to non gaap reconciliation for further details 
the dodd frank act requires the federal reserve to impose more stringent capital requirements on bank holding companies with assets of billion or more 
consequently  as part of regions annual ccar  regions must submit its annual capital plans to the federal reserve 
as part of the ccar  regions is required to submit five scenarios including the company s baseline forecast  the federal reserve s baseline outlook  the company s stress case and both of the federal reserve s adverse stress case and severely adverse stress case 
regions is required to maintain its capital levels above each minimum regulatory capital ratio and above a tier common ratio of percent on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout a certain time period horizon 
any capital actions requested by regions must be submitted to the federal reserve for approval 
the federal reserve has committed to responding to regions capital plans by march  the federal reserve intends to publish its results of the supervisory stress test component of ccar for regions and all companies that are participating 
additionally  regions intends to publish its own results of the federal reserve s severely adverse case stress test for both regions financial corporation and its primary bank subsidiary regions bank 
regions is evaluating the anticipated impact of basel iii which is expected to be phased in beginning in the federal reserve has announced a delay in the implementation date of the final rules  however  when implemented there will be a phase in period of up to years 
the company s estimated tier common ratio as of december   based on regions current understanding of the basel iii requirements  as proposed by the us notices of proposed rulemaking npr released in june  was approximately percent and therefore exceeded the basel iii minimum of percent for tier common 
in january  the basel committee published an update that included revisions to the liquidity coverage ratio lcr calculation 
inclusive in this update were provisions included but not limited to  lower deposit run off assumptions and full implementation on a phase in schedule 
starting in  firms will be required to be at a minimum compliance ratio of percent  with equal annual increase until the percent minimum requirement is reached in based on regions understanding and interpretation of the rules for the calculation for the lcr under basel iii  regions is currently above the percent coverage minimum 
the company anticipates being fully compliant with the lcr requirements upon finalization and implementation 
however  should regions cash position or investment mix change in the future  regions ability to meet the liquidity coverage ratio may be impacted 
additionally  there is still need for clarification of the basel iii rules as well as interpretation and implementation by us banking regulators  so the ultimate impact of basel iii on regions is not completely known at this point 
the npr comment period ended in october  changes to the calculation resulting from the comment process could result in materially different capital ratios from the amounts estimated 
because the basel iii capital calculations are not formally defined by gaap and are not currently prescribed in amount by the federal banking regulations  these measures are considered to be non gaap financial measures  and other entities may calculate them differently than regions disclosed calculations see table gaap to non gaap reconciliation for further details

during the fourth quarter of  regions redeemed all issued and outstanding trust preferred securities issued by regions financing trust iii  which totaled approximately million 
these trusts meet the definition of a variable interest entity of which regions is not the primary beneficiary  the trusts only assets are junior subordinated debentures issued by regions  which were acquired by the trusts using the proceeds from the issuance of the trust preferred securities and common stock 
the junior subordinated debentures are included in long term borrowings see note long term borrowings to the consolidated financial statements  and regions equity interests in the business trusts are included in other assets 
for regulatory reporting and capital adequacy purposes  the federal reserve board has indicated that such trust preferred securities currently constitute tier capital  but beginning in  trust preferred securities will be phased out as an allowable component of tier capital over a three year period 
additional discussion regarding the status of capital treatment for these instruments is included in the supervision and regulation capital requirements section of item of this annual report on form k

effects of inflation the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature  therefore  a financial institution differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies  which have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories that are greatly impacted by inflation 
however  inflation does have an important impact on the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation also affects other expenses that tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
management believes the most significant potential impact of inflation on financial results is a direct result of regions ability to manage the impact of changes in interest rates 
management attempts to maintain an essentially balanced position between rate sensitive assets and liabilities in order to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations on net interest income 
however  this goal can be difficult to completely achieve in times of rapidly changing rate structure and is one of many factors considered in determining the company s interest rate positioning 
the company is moderately asset sensitive as of december  refer to table interest rate sensitivity for additional details on regions interest rate sensitivity 
effects of deflation a period of deflation would affect all industries  including financial institutions 
potentially  deflation could lead to lower profits  higher unemployment  lower production and deterioration in overall economic conditions 
in addition  deflation could depress economic activity and impair bank earnings through increasing the value of debt while decreasing the value of collateral for loans 
if the economy experienced a severe period of deflation  then it could depress loan demand  impair the ability of borrowers to repay loans and sharply reduce bank earnings 
management believes the most significant potential impact of deflation on financial results relates to regions ability to maintain a sufficient amount of capital to cushion against future losses 
however  the company can utilize certain risk management tools to help it maintain its balance sheet strength even if a deflationary scenario were to develop 
risk management risk identification and risk management are key elements in the overall management of regions 
management believes the primary risk exposures are market risk  liquidity risk  counterparty risk  international risk and credit risk 
market risk is the price and earnings variability mainly reductions arising from adverse changes in the fair values of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or the credit quality of debt securities and or the impact to net interest income based on changes in interest rates interest rate risk and the associated impact on prepayments prepayment risk 
interest rate risk is the risk to net interest income due to the impact of movements in interest rates 
prepayment risk is the risk that borrowers may repay their loans or other debt earlier than at their stated maturities 
liquidity risk relates to regions ability to fund present and future obligations 
counterparty risk represents the risk that a counterparty will not comply with its contractual obligations 
international risk  or country exposure  is defined 
table of contents as the aggregation of exposure regions has with financial institutions  companies  or individuals in a given country outside of the united states 
credit risk represents the risk that parties indebted to regions fail to perform as contractually obligated 
regions primary credit risk arises from the possibility that borrowers may not be able to repay loans  and to a lesser extent  the failure of securities issuers and counterparties to perform as contractually required 
management follows a formal process for identifying and documenting key risks facing each line of business  how those risks can be controlled or mitigated  and how management monitors the controls to ensure that they are effective 
separate from risk acceptance  there is an independent risk assessment and reporting program 
to ensure that risks within the company are appropriately addressed  the board has designated a risk committee of outside directors 
the risk committee s focus is on regions overall risk profile  and the committee receives reports from the company s management quarterly 
additionally  regions internal audit division performs ongoing  independent reviews of the risk management process which are reported to the audit committee of the board of directors 
some of the more significant processes used to manage and control these and other risks are described in the remainder of this report 
external factors beyond management s control may result in losses despite risk management efforts 
market risk interest rate risk regions primary market risk is interest rate risk  including uncertainty with respect to absolute interest rate levels as well as uncertainty with respect to relative interest rate levels  which is impacted by both the shape and the slope of the various yield curves that affect the financial products and services that the company offers 
to quantify this risk  regions measures the change in its net interest income in various interest rate scenarios compared to a base case scenario 
net interest income sensitivity is a useful short term indicator of regions interest rate risk 
sensitivity measurement financial simulation models are regions primary tools used to measure interest rate exposure 
using a wide range of sophisticated simulation techniques provides management with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates 
models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of regions balance sheet 
assumptions are made about the direction and volatility of interest rates  the slope of the yield curve  and the changing composition of the balance sheet that result from both strategic plans and from customer behavior 
among the assumptions are expectations of balance sheet growth and composition  the pricing and maturity characteristics of existing business and the characteristics of future business 
interest rate related risks are expressly considered  such as pricing spreads  the lag time in pricing deposit accounts  prepayments and other option risks 
regions considers these factors  as well as the degree of certainty or uncertainty surrounding their future behavior 
the primary objective of asset liability management at regions is to coordinate balance sheet composition with interest rate risk management to sustain a reasonable and stable net interest income throughout various interest rate cycles 
in computing interest rate sensitivity for measurement  regions compares a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario based on market forward rates 
the standard set of interest rate scenarios includes the traditional instantaneous parallel rate shifts of plus and basis points 
regions also prepares a minus basis points scenario  as minus and basis point scenarios are not considered realistic in the current rate environment 
up rate scenarios of greater magnitude are also analyzed  and are of increased importance as the current and historic low levels of interest rates increase the relative likelihood of a rapid and substantial increase in interest rates 
regions also includes simulations of gradual interest rate movements that may more realistically mimic potential interest rate movements 
these gradual scenarios include curve steepening  flattening  and parallel movements of various magnitudes phased in over a six month period  and include rate shifts of minus basis points and plus and basis points 

table of contents exposure to interest rate movements as of december   regions was moderately asset sensitive to both gradual and instantaneous rate shifts as compared to the base case for the measurement horizon ending december table interest rate sensitivity illustrates several rate shift scenarios 
the protractedly low interest rate environment that has prevailed over the past few years has led many borrowers  especially those with loans at fixed rates of interest  to refinance or prepay their loans 
this has resulted in considerable pressure on net interest margin and net interest income as these loans and fixed rate investment securities were replaced by other assets at lower yields 
however  at the same time  the broader economic conditions and the level of short term interest rates  in particular  produced ample opportunities for the reduction of deposit and borrowing costs 
if long term rates were to decline materially from the recent implied market forward outlook  regions loan and securities portfolios would expect to be subject to higher levels of prepayment 
deposit costs  having benefited from several years of very low short term rates  would likely experience additional reduction from recent levels  but the magnitude of decline may not be as pronounced as in the past few years 
in total  regions estimates an impact of a basis points instantaneous and gradual decline in interest rates at million and million respectively  for the measurement period ending december note that where scenarios would indicate negative interest rates  a minimum of zero is applied 
in the converse environment  in which rates rise  regions estimates that the speed of loan and securities prepayment will slow considerably and deposit rates would rise  but the negative impact of these factors would be more than offset by higher rates on new loans and securities as well as the repricing of existing floating rate loans 
table interest rate sensitivity gradual change in interest rates estimated annual change in net interest income december  in millions basis points basis points basis points instantaneous change in interest rates basis points basis points basis points interest rate movements may also have an impact on the value of regions securities portfolio  which can directly impact the carrying value of shareholders equity 
regions from time to time may hedge these price movements with derivatives as discussed below 
derivatives regions uses financial derivative instruments for management of interest rate sensitivity 
the asset and liability committee alco  which consists of members of regions senior management team  in its oversight role for the management of interest rate sensitivity  approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging strategies 
the most common derivatives regions employs are forward rate contracts  eurodollar futures contracts  interest rate swaps  options on interest rate swaps  interest rate caps and floors  and forward sale commitments 
derivatives are also used to offset the risks associated with customer derivatives  which include interest rate  credit and foreign exchange risks 
forward rate contracts are commitments to buy or sell financial instruments at a future date at a specified price or yield 
a eurodollar futures contract is a future on a eurodollar deposit 
eurodollar futures contracts subject regions to market risk associated with changes in interest rates 
because futures contracts are cash settled daily  there is minimal credit risk associated with eurodollar futures 
interest rate swaps are contractual agreements typically entered into to exchange fixed for variable or vice versa streams of interest payments 
the notional principal is not exchanged but is used as a reference for the size of interest settlements 
interest rate 
table of contents options are contracts that allow the buyer to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a predetermined price and time 
forward sale commitments are contractual obligations to sell market instruments at a future date for an already agreed upon price 
foreign currency contracts involve the exchange of one currency for another on a specified date and at a specified rate 
these contracts are executed on behalf of the company s customers and are used to manage fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
the company is subject to the credit risk that another party will fail to perform 
regions has made use of interest rate swaps to effectively convert a portion of its fixed rate funding position to a variable rate position and  in some cases  to effectively convert a portion of its variable rate loan portfolio to fixed rate 
regions also uses derivatives to manage interest rate and pricing risk associated with its mortgage origination business 
in the period of time that elapses between the origination and sale of mortgage loans  changes in interest rates have the potential to cause a decline in the value of the loans in this held for sale portfolio 
futures contracts and forward sale commitments are used to protect the value of the loan pipeline and loans held for sale from changes in interest rates and pricing 
regions manages the credit risk of these instruments in much the same way as it manages credit risk of the loan portfolios by establishing credit limits for each counterparty and through collateral agreements for dealer transactions 
for non dealer transactions  the need for collateral is evaluated on an individual transaction basis and is primarily dependent on the financial strength of the counterparty 
credit risk is also reduced significantly by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements 
when there is more than one transaction with a counterparty and there is a legally enforceable master netting agreement in place  the exposure represents the net of the gain and loss positions with and collateral received from and or posted to that counterparty 
the credit risk section in this report contains more information on the management of credit risk 
regions also uses derivatives to meet the needs of its customers 
interest rate swaps  interest rate options and foreign exchange forwards are the most common derivatives sold to customers 
other derivatives instruments with similar characteristics are used to hedge market risk and minimize volatility associated with this portfolio 
instruments used to service customers are held in the trading account  with changes in value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
the primary objective of regions hedging strategies is to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes  from an economic perspective  on net interest income and the net present value of its balance sheet 
the overall effectiveness of these hedging strategies is subject to market conditions  the quality of regions execution  the accuracy of its valuation assumptions  counterparty credit risk and changes in interest rates 
see note derivative financial instruments and hedging activities to the consolidated financial statements for a tabular summary of regions year end derivatives positions and further discussion 
on january   regions began accounting for mortgage servicing rights at fair market value with any changes to fair value being recorded within mortgage income 
also  in early  regions entered into derivative and balance sheet transactions to mitigate the impact of market value fluctuations related to mortgage servicing rights 
derivative instruments entered into in the future could be materially different from the current risk profile of regions current portfolio 
market risk prepayment risk regions  like most financial institutions  is subject to changing prepayment speeds on mortgage related assets under different interest rate environments 
prepayment risk is a significant risk to earnings and specifically to net interest income 
for example  mortgage loans and other financial assets may be prepaid by a debtor  so that the debtor may refinance its obligations at lower rates 
as loans and other financial assets prepay in a falling rate environment  regions must reinvest these funds in lower yielding assets 
prepayments of assets carrying higher rates reduce regions interest income and overall asset yields 
conversely  in a rising rate environment  these assets will prepay at a slower rate  resulting in opportunity cost by not having the cash flow to reinvest at higher 
table of contents rates 
prepayment risk can also impact the value of securities and the carrying value of equity 
regions greatest exposures to prepayment risks primarily rest in its mortgage backed securities portfolio  the mortgage fixed rate loan portfolio and the mortgage servicing asset  all of which tend to be sensitive to interest rate movements 
regions also has prepayment risk that would be reflected in non interest income in the form of servicing income on loans sold 
regions actively evaluates prepayment exposure as part of its overall net interest income forecasting and interest rate risk management 
in particular  because current interest rates are relatively low  regions is actively managing exposure to declining prepayments that are expected to coincide with increasing interest rates in both the loan and securities portfolios 
market risk brokerage and other market activity risk on january   regions entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell morgan keegan company  inc and related affiliates to raymond james financial  inc the transaction closed on april  refer to note discontinued operations  to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
regions capital markets business  which includes derivatives  loan syndication and foreign exchange trading activities  expose it to market risk 
further  the company is exposed to non trading market risk from mortgage hedging activities which include secondary marketing of loans to government sponsored entities and mortgage servicing rights valuation 
to manage trading risks arising from interest rate and equity price risks  regions uses a value at risk var model along with other risk management methods to measure the potential fair value the company could lose on its trading positions given a specified statistical confidence level and time to liquidate time horizon 
the end of period day var was approximately thousand at december  and thousand at december  maximum day var utilization during was million and average day var during the same period was thousand 
liquidity risk liquidity is an important factor in the financial condition of regions and affects regions ability to meet the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal requirements of its customers 
regions intends to fund obligations primarily through cash generated from normal operations 
in addition to these obligations  regions has obligations related to potential litigation contingencies 
see note commitments  contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the company s funding requirements 
assets  consisting principally of loans and securities  are funded by customer deposits  purchased funds  borrowed funds and stockholders equity 
regions goal in liquidity management is to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  while at the same time meeting the company s cash flow needs 
the challenges of the current market environment demonstrate the importance of having and using various sources of liquidity to satisfy the company s funding requirements 
in order to ensure an appropriate level of liquidity is maintained  regions performs specific procedures including scenario analyses and stress testing at the bank  holding company  and affiliate levels 
regions holding company cash is managed to a conservative three step evaluation 
the minimum cash requirement utilizes a three step process that requires the parent to hold the greater of two years of corporate dividends  debt service  and maturities by utilizing cash on hand  and the next four quarters expected dividend capacity from regions bank  enough cash on hand with no upstream dividend capacity from regions bank to meet corporate dividends  debt service payments and maturities for the next months  or a minimum cash requirement of million 
regions runs similar testing scenarios and has minimum liquidity requirements for the bank and subsidiaries 
the company s funding and contingency planning does not currently include any reliance on unsecured sources 
risk limits are established within the company s alco  which regularly reviews compliance 
table of contents with the established limits 
regions parent company cash and cash equivalents as of december  was million 
regions contractual obligations and expected payment dates are presented in the following table table contractual obligations payments due by period less than year years years more than years indeterminable maturity total in millions deposits short term borrowings long term borrowings lease obligations purchase obligations benefit obligations commitments to fund low income housing partnerships unrecognized tax benefits indemnification obligation visa litigation deposits with indeterminable maturity include non interest bearing demand  savings  interest bearing transaction accounts and money market accounts 
amounts only include obligations related to the unfunded non qualified pension plan and postretirement health care plan 
commitments to fund low income housing partnerships do not have defined maturity dates 
therefore  they have been considered due on demand  maturing one year or less 
includes liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of million and tax related interest and penalties of million

see note commitments contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements for the company s commercial commitments at december  see note commitments contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the indemnification obligation to raymond james  and the rationale for the expected payment timeframe 
the securities portfolio is one of regions primary sources of liquidity 
maturities of securities provide a constant flow of funds available for cash needs see note securities to the consolidated financial statements 
the agency guaranteed mortgage portfolio is another source of liquidity in various secured borrowing capacities 
maturities in the loan portfolio also provide a steady flow of funds see table selected loan maturities 
at december   commercial loans and investor real estate mortgage and construction loans with an aggregate balance of billion were due to mature in one year or less  although regions may renew some of these lending arrangements if the risk profile is acceptable 
additionally  securities of million were due to contractually mature in one year or less 
additional funds are provided from payments on consumer loans and one to four family residential first mortgage loans 
in addition  liquidity needs can also be met by borrowing funds in state and national money markets  although regions does not currently rely on unsecured wholesale market funding 
historically  regions liquidity has been enhanced by its relatively stable customer deposit base 
regions elected to exit the fdic s tag program on july  the tag program was a component of the temporary liquidity guarantee program  whereby the fdic guaranteed all funds held at participating institutions beyond the  deposit insurance limit in qualifying transaction accounts 
the decision to exit 
table of contents the program did not have a significant impact on liquidity 
the dodd frank act permanently increased the fdic coverage limit to  as a result of the dodd frank act  effective december   unlimited coverage for non interest bearing demand transaction accounts was provided until january  in early  non interest bearing transaction accounts have declined  but the overall impact to deposit balances and liquidity has not been significant and is within expectations 
regulation q prohibited banks from paying interest on business checking accounts in accordance with the glass steagall act of however  the dodd frank act repealed regulation q 
in july  financial institutions  such as regions  were allowed to offer interest on corporate checking accounts 
regions responded to these changes by enhancing its existing core interest bearing products 
however  due to the low interest rate environment and unlimited fdic insurance available on non interest bearing balances until january   the company has not experienced  nor does it anticipate experiencing significant migration of business customer balances from non interest bearing accounts to an interest bearing account 
due to the potential for uncertainty and inconsistency in the unsecured funding markets  regions has been maintaining higher levels of cash liquidity by depositing excess cash with the federal reserve bank  which is the primary component of the balance sheet line item  interest bearing deposits in other banks 
at december   regions had over billion in excess cash on deposit with the federal reserve 
regions borrowing availability with the federal reserve bank as of december   based on assets available for collateral at that date  was billion 
regions periodically accesses funding markets through sales of securities with agreements to repurchase 
repurchase agreements are also offered through a commercial banking sweep product as a short term investment opportunity for customers 
all such arrangements are considered typical of the banking industry and are accounted for as borrowings 
regions financing arrangement with the fhlb adds additional flexibility in managing its liquidity position 
as of december   regions borrowing availability from the fhlb totaled billion 
fhlb borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral pledged to the fhlb 
regions bank and its subsidiaries have pledged certain residential first mortgage loans on one to four family dwellings and home equity lines of credit as collateral for the fhlb advances outstanding 
additionally  investment in fhlb stock is required in relation to the level of outstanding borrowings 
regions held million in fhlb stock at december  the fhlb has been and is expected to continue to be a reliable and economical source of funding 
in february  regions filed a shelf registration statement with the us securities and exchange commission 
this shelf registration does not have a capacity limit and can be utilized by regions to issue various debt and or equity securities 
the registration statement will expire in february regions expects to file a new shelf registration statement prior to the expiration of the current shelf registration statement 
in  regions issued from the shelf million shares of common stock with a par value per share at a share as well as million depositary shares each representing a th ownership interest in the company s non cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a  with a par value 
regions bank note program allows regions bank to issue up to billion aggregate principal amount of bank notes outstanding at any one time 
no issuances have been made under this program as of december  notes issued under the program may be senior notes with maturities from days to years and subordinated notes with maturities from years to years 
these notes are not deposits and they are not insured or guaranteed by the fdic 
on december   following a notice by the federal reserve of proposed rulemaking which would phase out the tier capital treatment of the trust preferred securities  regions redeemed approximately million of issued and outstanding trust preferred securities issued by regions financing trust iii 
regions determined that the federal reserve s approval for publication of the notice constituted a capital 
table of contents treatment event as defined in the indenture related to the trust preferred securities  which allowed regions to redeem the trust preferred securities pursuant to the terms of such securities 
regions may  from time to time  consider opportunistically retiring outstanding issued securities  including subordinated debt  trust preferred securities and preferred shares in privately negotiated or open market transactions for cash or common shares 
regulatory approval would be required for retirement of some instruments 
see the stockholders equity section for discussion of the federal reserve s comprehensive capital analysis and review 
counterparty risk regions manages and monitors its exposure to other financial institutions  also known as counterparty exposure  on an ongoing basis 
the objective is to ensure that regions appropriately identifies and reacts to risks associated with counterparties in a timely manner 
this exposure may be direct or indirect and could create financial  credit  legal  or reputational risk to the company 
counterparty exposure may result from a variety of transaction types and may include exposure to commercial banks  savings and loans  insurance companies  broker dealers  institutions that provide credit enhancements  and foreign corporate debt issuers 
because transactions with a counterparty may be generated in one or more departments  exposure limits are established for use by various areas of the company including treasury  investments group  capital markets  finance  the mortgage division  and other lines of business 
to manage counterparty risk  regions has a centralized approach to approval  management and monitoring of exposure 
to that end  regions has a dedicated counterparty credit group and credit officer  as well as a documented counterparty credit policy 
exposures to counterparties are regularly aggregated across departments and reported to senior management 
international risk regions has minimal sovereign credit exposure 
this includes an immaterial amount in government securities issued by a single non european sovereign  as well as a guarantee on a leveraged lease from a western european government agency 
however  regions does have country exposure  which is defined as the aggregation of exposure with financial institutions  companies  or individuals in a given country outside of the united states 
the majority of these exposures are in the form of corporate bonds purchased for the bank s investment portfolio  derivative hedges interest rate and foreign exchange  and leveraged lease guarantees 
this exposure is concentrated in highly rated  western european countries but not in those most severely affected by the eurozone turmoil 
in addition to western europe and australia  regions corporate securities include investments in corporations domiciled in other countries in eastern europe and north america 
regions has other smaller exposures in the form of trade confirmations  due from clearing accounts and loan participations with counterparties domiciled in countries in other regions  such as central and south america  asia and the middle east north africa region 
at december   regions international exposure was approximately billion in total outstandings 
approximately percent of the total exposure relates to corporate bonds 
approximately percent of the total exposure relates to highly rated western european entities 
regions counterparty risk department is responsible for the setting of country limits and managing of the outstanding country exposure for all departments of the bank as well as monitoring compliance of the outstanding exposure to the established limits 
reports are sent to counterparty risk by the lines of business on a monthly basis to demonstrate their compliance with their set limits 
counterparty risk conducts a formal  
table of contents quarterly assessment of the exposure  on both an outstanding and limit basis  which is then distributed to upper management for review 
credit risk regions objective regarding credit risk is to maintain a high quality credit portfolio that provides for stable credit costs with acceptable volatility through an economic cycle 
see the credit quality section found earlier in this report for further information 
management process regions employs a credit risk management process with defined policies  accountability and regular reporting to manage credit risk in the loan portfolio 
credit risk management is guided by credit policies that provide for a consistent and prudent approach to underwriting and approvals of credits 
within the credit policy department  procedures exist that elevate the approval requirements as credits become larger and more complex 
generally  consumer credits and smaller commercial credits are centrally underwritten based on custom credit matrices and policies that are modified as appropriate 
larger commercial and investor real estate transactions are individually underwritten  risk rated  approved and monitored 
responsibility and accountability for adherence to underwriting policies and accurate risk ratings lies in the lines of business 
for consumer and small business portfolios  the risk management process focuses on managing customers who become delinquent in their payments and managing performance of the credit scorecards  which are periodically adjusted based on actual credit performance 
the credit risk management division works with commercial relationship teams to analyze and underwrite new business opportunities  manage the overall loan portfolio  and perform ongoing credit servicing activities utilizing a risk based approach which incorporates quantitative and qualitative factors 
to ensure problem commercial credits are identified on a timely basis  several specific portfolio reviews occur each quarter to assess the larger adversely rated credits for accrual status and  if necessary  to ensure such individual credits are transferred to regions problem asset management division  which specializes in managing distressed credit exposures 
there are also separate and independent commercial credit and consumer credit risk management organizational groups 
these organizational units partner with the business line to assist in the processes described above  including the review and approval of new business and ongoing assessments of existing loans in the portfolio 
independent commercial and consumer credit risk management provides for more accurate risk ratings and the timely identification of problem credits  as well as oversight for the chief credit officer on conditions and trends in the credit portfolios 
credit quality and trends in the loan portfolio are measured and monitored regularly and detailed reports  by product  business unit and geography  are reviewed by line of business personnel and the chief credit officer 
the chief credit officer reviews summaries of these credit reports with executive management and the board of directors 
finally  the credit review department provides ongoing independent oversight of the credit portfolios to ensure policies are followed  credits are properly risk rated and that key credit control processes are functioning as intended 
risk characteristics of the loan portfolio in order to assess the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio  regions considers the current us economic environment and that of its primary banking markets  as well as risk factors within the major categories of loans 

table of contents economic environment in regions banking markets one of the primary factors influencing the credit performance of regions loan portfolio is the overall economic environment in the us and the primary markets in which it operates 
the great recession that began in december and ended in june took a severe toll on the us economy 
however  by year end many of the economic headwinds that had restrained the economy had diminished 
in particular  the housing market is recovering  consumers have reduced their leverage  and business and consumer confidence has improved 
considerable improvement is needed before the economy can be considered to have fully healed from the great recession 
the housing recovery comes from a low base and permits  starts  and sales will be well short of levels that could be considered normal for some time to come 
while having fallen to percent by year end  the unemployment rate remains well above a level that could be considered consistent with full employment  and at least some of the decline in the unemployment rate to date has come as a result of a lower labor force participation rate 
with what remains a high degree of labor market under utilization  wage and salary growth remains weak and uneven which  in turn  is reflected in a slow rate of growth in disposable personal income  particularly when adjusted for inflation 
it is expected that the private sector of the us economy will continue to strengthen throughout the housing market recovery should continue  household balance sheets should continue to improve  and corporate balance sheets are healthy 
what will remain is a highly stimulative monetary policy  with the federal open market committee fomc actively engaged in holding down long term interest rates that will be supportive of the recovery in the broader economy 
there are  however  some economic risks that could adversely impact regions operating environment over the near term 
as begins  federal fiscal policy is exerting a drag on the economy with the potential for this drag to intensify 
higher payroll tax rates impact all workers with wage and salary earnings  even those who may not pay personal income taxes 
this is expected to have a material adverse impact on growth in consumer spending during the first quarter of moreover  with the sequestration spending cuts set to take effect march   the economy is facing roughly billion of cutbacks in federal government expenditures on an annual basis for the next ten years  which would act as an additional drag on the broader economy 
additionally  while the risks of a catastrophic outcome in the euro zone have been diminished by an aggressive policy stance by the european central bank  the underlying structural constraints that act as a significant drag on growth in many euro zone nations have yet to be addressed  meaning that europe cannot be ruled out as a downside risk 
in summation  after the gross domestic product gdp grew at percent in  the us economy s gdp is expected to grow approximately percent in  with slower growth over the first half of the year and faster growth over the second half of the year 
should the recovery broaden and strengthen over the second half of  as is anticipated  economic growth would be stronger in portfolio characteristics regions has a diversified loan portfolio  in terms of product type  collateral and geography 
at december   commercial loans represented percent of total loans  net of unearned income  investor real estate loans represented percent  residential first mortgage loans totaled percent and other consumer loans  largely home equity lending  comprised the remaining percent 
following is a discussion of risk characteristics of each loan type 
commercial the commercial loan portfolio segment totaled billion at year end and primarily consists of loans to small and mid sized commercial and large corporate customers with business operations in regions geographic footprint 
loans in this portfolio are generally underwritten individually and are usually secured with the assets of the company and or the personal guarantee of the business owners 
also considered as 
table of contents commercial loans are owner occupied commercial real estate loans to businesses for long term financing of land and buildings 
regions attempts to minimize risk on owner occupied properties by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount  adequate cash flow to service the debt  and  in many cases  the personal guarantees of principals of the borrowers 
net charge offs on commercial loans were percent in compared to percent in investor real estate the investor real estate portfolio segment totaled billion at year end and includes various loan types 
a large component of investor real estate loans is extensions of credit to real estate developers and investors for the financing of land or buildings  where the repayment is generated from the sale of the real estate or income generated by the real estate property 
net charge offs on commercial investor real estate mortgage loans were percent in  as compared to percent in commercial investor real estate construction loans are primarily extensions of credit to real estate developers or investors where repayment is dependent on the sale of real estate or income generated from the real estate collateral 
these loans are generally underwritten and managed by a specialized real estate group that also manages loan disbursements during the construction process 
net charge offs on commercial investor real estate construction decreased from percent in to percent in residential first mortgage the residential first mortgage class in the consumer portfolio segment totaled billion at year end and primarily contains loans to individuals  which are secured by single family residences that are originated through regions branch network 
loans of this type are generally smaller in size than commercial or investor real estate loans and are geographically dispersed throughout regions market areas  with some guaranteed by government agencies or private mortgage insurers 
losses on the residential loan portfolio depend  to a large degree  on the level of interest rates  the unemployment rate  economic conditions and collateral values 
during  losses on single family residences totaled percent  as compared to percent in home equity the home equity class in the consumer portfolio segment totaled billion at december   as compared to billion at december  substantially all of this portfolio was originated through regions branch network 
losses in this portfolio generally track overall economic conditions 
during  losses on home equity decreased to percent from percent in most of the improvement in losses came from florida second liens because property values in florida markets have either stabilized or started to increase 
indirect indirect lending  which is lending initiated through third party business partners  is largely comprised of loans made through automotive dealerships 
beginning in late  the company re entered indirect auto lending 
during  this portfolio class increased million to billion 
losses on indirect loans were percent for  as compared to percent for consumer credit card during  regions completed the purchase of existing regions branded consumer credit card accounts from fia card services 
the products are primarily open ended variable interest rate consumer credit card loans 
during  this portfolio class decreased million to million 
losses on consumer credit card were percent for in the third quarter of  regions assumed the servicing of these loans from fia card services 
other consumer other consumer loans include direct consumer installment loans  overdrafts and other revolving credit  and educational loans 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of year end 
the allowance for credit losses consists of two components the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments 
management s assessment of the appropriateness of the allowance for 
table of contents credit losses is based on a combination of both of these components 
regions determines its allowance for credit losses in accordance with applicable accounting literature as well as regulatory guidance related to receivables and contingencies 
binding unfunded credit commitments include items such as letters of credit  financial guarantees and binding unfunded loan commitments 
allowance process factors considered by management in determining the adequacy of the allowance include  but are not limited to detailed reviews of individual loans  historical and current trends in gross and net loan charge offs for the various classes of loans evaluated  the company s policies relating to delinquent loans and charge offs  the level of the allowance in relation to total loans and to historical loss levels  levels and trends in non performing and past due loans  collateral values of properties securing loans  the composition of the loan portfolio  including unfunded credit commitments  management s analysis of current economic conditions  migration of loans between risk rating categories  and estimation of inherent credit losses in the portfolio 
in support of collateral values  regions obtains updated valuations for non performing loans on at least an annual basis 
for loans that are individually identified for impairment in certain loan categories  those valuations are currently discounted from the most recent appraisal to consider continued declines in property values 
the discounted valuations are utilized in the measurement of the level of impairment in the allowance calculation 
for loans that are not individually identified for impairment and secured by real estate  regions considers the impact of declines in real estate valuations in the loss given default estimates within the allowance calculation 
commercial and consumer credit risk management and problem asset management are all involved in the credit risk management process to assess the accuracy of risk ratings  the quality of the portfolio and the estimation of inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio 
this comprehensive process also assists in the prompt identification of problem credits 
the company has taken a number of measures to manage the portfolios and reduce risk  particularly in the more problematic portfolios 
in addition  a strong customer assistance program for consumer lending is in place which educates customers about options and initiates early contact with customers to discuss solutions when a loan first becomes delinquent 
for loans that are not specifically reviewed  management uses information from its ongoing review processes to stratify the loan portfolio into pools sharing common risk characteristics 
loans that share common risk characteristics are assigned a portion of the allowance for credit losses based on the assessment process described above 
credit exposures are categorized by type and assigned estimated amounts of inherent loss based on several factors  including current and historical loss experience for each pool and management s judgment of current economic conditions and their expected impact on credit performance 
adjustments to the allowance for loan losses calculated using a pooled approach are recorded through the provision for loan losses  adjustments to the reserve for unfunded credit commitments calculated using a pooled approach are recorded through noninterest expense 
as a matter of business practice  regions may require some form of credit support  such as a guarantee 
guarantees are legally binding and entered into simultaneously with the primary loan agreements 
regions underwrites the ability of each guarantor to perform under its guarantee in the same manner and to the same extent as would be required to underwrite the repayment plan of a direct obligor 
this entails obtaining sufficient information on the guarantor  including financial and operating information  to sufficiently measure the guarantor s ability to perform under the guarantee 
evaluation of guarantors ability and willingness to pay is considered as part of the risk rating process  which provides the basis for the allowance for loan losses for the commercial and investor real estate portfolio segments 
in some cases  the credit support provided by the guarantor is integral to the risk rating 
in concluding that the risk rating is appropriate  regions considers a number of factors including whether underlying cash flow is adequate to service the debt  payment history  and whether there is appropriate guarantor support 
accordingly  regions has concluded that the impact of credit support provided by guarantors has been appropriately considered in the calculation and assessment of the allowance for loan losses 

table of contents management considers the current level of allowance for credit losses appropriate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio and unfunded commitments 
management s determination of the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses  which is based on the factors and risk identification procedures previously discussed  requires the use of judgments and estimations that may change in the future 
changes in the factors used by management to determine the appropriateness of the allowance or the availability of new information could cause the allowance for credit losses to be increased or decreased in future periods 
management expects the allowance for credit losses to total loans ratio to vary over time due to changes in portfolio balances  economic conditions  loan mix and collateral values  or variations in other factors that may affect inherent losses 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies  as part of their examination process  may require changes in the level of the allowance based on their judgments and estimates 
additional discussion of the methodology used to calculate the allowance for credit losses is included in note summary of significant accounting policies and note allowance for credit losses to the consolidated financial statements 
details regarding the allowance for credit losses  including an analysis of activity from the previous year s total  are included in table allowance for credit losses 
also  refer to table allocation of the allowance for loan losses for details pertaining to management s allocation of the allowance for loan losses to each loan category 
financial disclosure and internal controls regions has always maintained internal controls over financial reporting  which generally include those controls relating to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us regions process for evaluating internal controls over financial reporting starts with understanding the risks facing each of its functions and areas  how those risks are controlled or mitigated  and how management monitors those controls to ensure that they are in place and effective 
these risks  control procedures and monitoring tools are documented in a standard format 
this format not only documents the internal control structures over all significant accounts  but also places responsibility on management for establishing feedback mechanisms to ensure that controls are effective 
regions has also established processes to ensure appropriate disclosure controls and procedures are maintained 
these controls and procedures as defined by the securities and exchange commission sec are generally designed to ensure that financial and non financial information required to be disclosed in reports filed with the sec is reported within the time periods specified in the sec s rules and forms  and that such information is communicated to management  including the chief executive officer ceo and chief financial officer cfo  as appropriate  to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 
regions disclosure review committee  which includes representatives from the legal  risk management  accounting  investor relations  treasury and audit departments  meets quarterly to review recent internal and external events to determine whether all appropriate disclosures have been made in reports filed with the sec 
in addition  the ceo and cfo meet quarterly with the sec filings review committee  which includes senior representatives from accounting  legal  risk management  audit  treasury  the lines of business  and administration 
the sec filings review committee reviews certain reports to be filed with the sec  including forms k and q and evaluates the adequacy and accuracy of the disclosures 
as part of this process  certifications of internal control effectiveness are obtained from accounting  treasury  legal  audit  risk management  the lines of business and administration 
these certifications are reviewed and presented to the ceo and cfo as support of the company s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting 
the form k is presented to the audit committee of the board of directors for approval  and the forms q are reviewed by the audit committee 
financial results and other financial information are also reviewed with the audit committee on a quarterly basis 
as required by applicable regulatory pronouncements  the ceo and the cfo review and make various certifications regarding the accuracy of regions periodic public reports filed with the sec  as well as the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting
