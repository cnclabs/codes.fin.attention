the terms of this venture do not prohibit us from developing a wholly owned student housing property for our own account 
critical accounting policies set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated and combined financial statements 
certain of these accounting policies are particularly important for an understanding of the financial position and results of operations presented in the consolidated and combined financial statements set forth elsewhere in this report 
these policies require the application of judgment and assumptions by management and  as a result  are subject to a degree of uncertainty 
actual results could differ as a result of such judgment and assumptions 
our consolidated and combined financial statements include the accounts of all investments  which include joint ventures in which we have a controlling interest  and our consolidated subsidiaries and the combined subsidiaries of the predecessor 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our historical consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has utilized all available information  including its past history  industry standards and the current economic environment  among other factors  in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the historical consolidated and combined financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
our estimates may not be ultimately realized 
application of the critical accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results will differ from these estimates 
in addition  other companies in similar businesses may utilize different estimation policies and methodologies  which may impact the comparability of our results of operations and financial condition to those companies 
valuation of investment in real estate investment in real estate is recorded at historical cost 
pre development expenditures include items such as entitlement costs  architectural fees and deposits associated with the pursuit of partially owned and wholly owned development projects 
these costs are capitalized until such time that management believes it is no longer probable that a contract will be executed and or construction will commence 
management evaluates the status of projects where we have not yet acquired the target property or where we have not yet commenced construction on a periodic basis and writes off any pre development costs related to projects whose current status indicates the commencement of construction is not probable 
such write offs are included within operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated and combined statements of operations 
management assesses whether there has been impairment in the value of our investment in real estate whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of investment in real estate is assessed by a comparison of the carrying amount of a student housing property to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the property 
impairment is recognized when estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the property 
the estimation of expected future undiscounted cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future economics and market conditions 
if such conditions change  then an adjustment reducing the carrying value of our long lived assets could occur in the future period in which conditions change 
to the extent that a property is impaired  the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to operating earnings 
fair value is determined based upon the discounted cash flows of the property  quoted market prices or independent appraisals  as considered necessary 
investment in unconsolidated entities under the equity method  investments in unconsolidated entities are initially recognized in the balance sheet at cost and are subsequently adjusted to reflect our proportionate share of net earnings or losses of the entity  distributions received  contributions  and certain other adjustments  as appropriate 
any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on our balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated entities 
when circumstances indicate there may have been a loss in value of an equity method investment  and we determine the loss in value is other than temporary  we recognize an impairment charge to reflect the investment at fair value 
development  construction and management services development and construction service revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method  as determined by construction costs incurred relative to total estimated construction costs 
any changes in significant judgments and or estimates used in determining construction and development revenue could significantly change the timing or amount of construction and development revenue recognized 
development and construction service revenues are recognized for contracts with entities we do not consolidate 
for projects where revenue is based on a fixed price  any cost overruns incurred during construction  as compared to the original budget  will reduce the net profit ultimately recognized on those projects 
profit derived from these projects is eliminated to the extent of our interest in the unconsolidated entity 
any incentive fees  net of the impact of our ownership interest  are recognized when the project is complete and performance has been agreed upon by all parties  or when performance has been verified by an independent third party 
when total development or construction costs at completion exceed the fixed price set forth within the related contract  such cost overruns are recorded as additional investment in the unconsolidated entity to the extent these amounts are determined to be realizable 
entitlement fees  where applicable  are recognized when earned based on the terms of the related contract 
allowance for doubtful accounts allowances for student receivables are established when management determines that collections of such receivables are doubtful 
balances are considered past due when payment is not received on the contractual due date 
when management has determined receivables are uncollectible  they are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
fair value of financial instruments the carrying value of cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash  student receivables and accounts payable are representative of their respective fair values due to the short term nature of these instruments 
the estimated fair value of our revolving line of credit approximates the outstanding balance due to the frequent market based re pricing of the underlying variable rate index 
the estimated fair values of mortgages and construction loans are determined by comparing current borrowing rates and risk spreads offered in the market to the stated interest rates and spreads on our current mortgages and construction loans 
fair value guidance for financial assets and liabilities that are recognized and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and nonfinancial assets on a nonrecurring basis establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurements and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs level measurements 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows level observable inputs  such as quoted prices in active markets at the measurement date for identical  unrestricted assets or liabilities 
level other inputs that are observable directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs which are observable  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the asset or liability 
level unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data and which we make our own assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received when selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price 
in instances where inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety has been determined is based on the lowest level input significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability 
income taxes we have made an election to qualify  and believe we are operating so as to qualify  as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code 
our qualification as a reit depends upon our ability to meet on a continuing basis  through actual investment and operating results  various complex requirements under the internal revenue code relating to  among other things  the sources of our gross income  the composition and values of our assets  our distribution levels and the diversity of ownership of our stock 
we believe that we are organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit under the internal revenue code and that our intended manner of operation will enable us to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit 
as a reit  we generally are not subject to us federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions  we will be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates and generally will be precluded from qualifying as a reit for the subsequent four taxable years following the year during which we lost our reit qualification 
accordingly  our failure to qualify as a reit could materially and adversely affect us  including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders in the future 
we have made the election to treat trs holdings  our subsidiary which holds our development  construction and management companies that provide services to entities in which we do not own of the equity interests  as a trs 
as a trs  the operations of trs holdings and its subsidiaries are generally subject to federal  state and local income and franchise taxes 
our trs accounts for its income taxes in accordance with us gaap  which includes an estimate of the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
deferred tax assets and liabilities of the trs entities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
we follow a two step approach for evaluating uncertain tax positions 
recognition step one occurs when we conclude that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not a likelihood of more than percent to be sustained upon examination 
measurement step two determines the amount of benefit that more likely than not will be realized upon settlement 
derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when we subsequently determined that a tax position no longer met the more likely than not threshold of being sustained 
the use of a valuation allowance as a substitute for derecognition of tax positions is prohibited 
property acquisitions we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets based on relative fair values 
fair value estimates are based on information obtained from independent appraisals  other market data  information obtained during due diligence and information related to the marketing and leasing at the specific property 
the value of in place leases is based on the difference between i the property valued with existing in place leases adjusted to market rental rates and ii the property valued as if vacant 
as lease terms are typically one year or less  rates on in place leases generally approximate market rental rates 
factors considered in the valuation of in place leases include an estimate of the carrying costs during the expected lease up period considering current market conditions  nature of the tenancy and costs to execute similar leases 
carrying costs include estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up period  net of variable operating expenses 
the value of in place leases is amortized over the remaining initial term of the respective leases  generally less than one year 
the purchase price of property acquisitions is not expected to be allocated to tenant relationships  considering the terms of the leases and the expected levels of renewals 
acquisition related costs such as due diligence  legal and accounting fees are expensed as incurred and not applied in determining the fair value of an acquired property 
changes in financial condition in february  we completed an underwritten public offering of approximately million shares of our series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock series a preferred stock  including approximately million shares issued and sold pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters overallotment option in full 
the shares of series a preferred stock were issued at a public offering price of per share  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering costs 
we used a portion of the net proceeds to repay approximately million of indebtedness outstanding under two construction loans  which had been used to partially fund the four properties that were delivered for the academic year see note to the accompanying consolidated and combined financial statements 
we used the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes  including funding properties currently under development 
in july  we completed an underwritten public offering of approximately million shares of common stock  including approximately million shares issued and sold pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters option to purchase additional shares  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
the net proceeds were used to acquire the remaining ownership interests in the grove at moscow  idaho and the grove at valdosta  georgia that we did not already own  and to repay the mortgage debt secured by these properties  and to reduce borrowings outstanding under the credit facility 
remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 
in january  we entered into the second amended and restated credit agreement the second amended and restated credit agreement with citibank  na and certain other lenders see note and note to the accompanying consolidated and combined financial statements 
the second amended and restated credit agreement provides for a senior unsecured revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility of up to million  with sub limits of million for swing line loans and million for letters of credit 
the second amended and restated credit agreement also provides for a term loan of million the term loan  and together with the revolving credit facility  the amended credit facility 
unless otherwise terminated pursuant to the terms of the second amended and restated credit agreement  the amended credit facility will mature on january   subject to a one year extension which we may exercise at our option  pursuant to certain terms and conditions  including the payment of an extension fee 
the second amended and restated credit agreement had the effect of retroactively applying the amended terms  including interest rates  covenants and borrowing capacity limits  to december  for additional information regarding the credit facility  please refer to liquidity and capital resources principal capital resources below 
reit qualification requirements we have elected to be treated as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code 
our continued qualification as a reit depends upon our ability to meet on a continuing basis  through actual investment and operating results  various complex requirements under the internal revenue code relating to  among other things  the sources of our gross income  the composition and values of our assets  our distribution levels and the diversity of ownership of our stock 
we believe that our intended manner of operation will enable us to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to us federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders 
factors expected to affect our operating results unique leasing characteristics student housing properties are typically leased by the bed on an individual lease liability basis  unlike multi family housing where leasing is by the unit 
individual lease liability limits each student tenant s liability to his or her own rent without liability for a roommate s rent 
a parent or guardian is required to execute each lease as a guarantor unless the student tenant provides adequate proof of income 
the number of lease contracts that we administer is therefore equivalent to the number of beds occupied rather than the number of units 
due to our predominantly private bedroom accommodations  the high level of student oriented amenities offered at our properties and the individual lease liability for our student tenants and their parents  we believe that we typically command higher per unit and per square foot rental rates than many multi family properties located in the markets in which we operate 
we are also typically able to charge higher rental rates than on campus student housing  which generally offers fewer amenities 
unlike traditional multi family housing  most of our leases commence on the same date 
in the case of our typical month leases which provide for equal monthly payments  this date coincides with the commencement of the fall academic term and typically terminates at the completion of the last summer school session 
as such  we must re lease each property in its entirety each year  resulting in significant turnover in our tenant population from year to year 
as a result  we are highly dependent upon the effectiveness of our marketing and leasing efforts during the annual leasing season  which typically begins each october and ends in september of the following year 
as of the start of the fall term for the and academic years  we had approximately and  respectively  of our current tenants renew their previous lease for the upcoming term 
development  construction and management services the amount and timing of revenues from development  construction and management services will typically be contingent upon the number and size of development projects that we are able to successfully structure and finance in our current and future unconsolidated joint ventures 
in particular  we entered into joint ventures hsre vi and hsre ix described above that are currently building three student housing properties with completion targeted for the academic year and one student housing property with completion targeted for the academic year  respectively 
we will receive fees for providing development and construction services to hsre vi and receive management fees for managing properties owned by hsre vi once they are placed in service 
we will share in the receipt of fees for providing development services to hsre ix and share in the receipt of management fees for managing the property owned by hsre ix once it is placed in service 
no assurance can be given that hsre vi or hsre ix will be successful in developing student housing properties as currently contemplated or those currently under construction 
results of operations our business segments management evaluates operating performance through the analysis of results of operations of two distinct business segments i student housing operations and ii development  construction and management services 
management evaluates each segment s performance by net operating income  which we define as operating income before depreciation and amortization 
the accounting policies of our reportable business segments are described in more detail in the summary of significant accounting policies footnote note to our consolidated and combined financial statements 
intercompany fees are reflected at the contractually stipulated amounts  as adjusted to reflect our proportionate ownership of unconsolidated entities 
student housing operations our student housing operations are comprised of rental and other service revenues  such as application fees  pet fees and late payment fees 
we opened our first student housing property in asheville  north carolina in for the academic year 
we subsequently opened three additional properties in for the academic year  six additional properties in for the academic year and nine additional properties in for the academic year 
in  we opened one additional property that was consolidated by our predecessor and four additional properties that were owned by a real estate venture in which we have a noncontrolling interest 
in august  we opened three additional properties for the academic year that were owned by the same real estate venture 
concurrent with the offering  in october we purchased the noncontrolling interest in one of the properties owned by this real estate venture 
in december  we purchased the controlling interest in two properties that were opened in august in august  we opened four wholly owned properties and an additional two properties that are owned in real estate ventures in which we have a noncontrolling interest 
in july  we purchased the controlling interest in two properties that were opened in august and august in august and september  we opened three wholly owned properties and an additional three properties that are owned in a real estate ventures in which we have a noncontrolling interest 
due to the continuous opening of new properties in consecutive years and annual lease terms that do not coincide with our reported fiscal calendar years  the comparison of our consolidated financial results from period to period may not provide a meaningful measure of our operating performance 
for this reason  we divide the results of operations in our student housing operations segment between new property operations and same store operations  which we believe provides a more meaningful indicator of comparative historical performance 
same store properties are our wholly owned operating properties acquired or placed in service prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by us and remaining in service through the end of the latest period presented or period being analyzed 
new properties are our wholly owned operating properties that we acquired or placed in service after the beginning of the earliest period presented or period being analyzed 
we monitor net operating income noi of our student housing properties  which is a non gaap financial measure 
in general terms  we define noi as student housing rental revenue less student housing operating expenses including real estate taxes related to our properties 
we believe this measure provides an operating perspective not immediately apparent from gaap operating income loss or net income loss 
we use noi to evaluate performance on a community by community basis because it allows management to evaluate the impact that factors such as lease structure  lease rates and tenant base  which vary by locality  have on our financial performance 
to help make comparisons of noi between periods more meaningful  we distinguish noi from our properties that are wholly owned and that were in service throughout each period presented that is  our same store properties from noi from our other wholly owned properties 
we specifically calculate noi by adding back to or subtracting from net income loss attributable to common stockholders the following expenses or charges income tax expense  other expense  interest expense  equity in loss of unconsolidated entities  depreciation and amortization  ground lease expense  general and administrative expense  development  construction and management services expenses and other non recurring costs or expenses 
the following income or gains are then deducted from net income loss attributable to common stockholders  adjusted for add backs of expenses or charges other income  change in fair value of interest rate derivatives  development  construction and management services revenues and non recurring income or gains 
noi excludes multiple components of net income loss attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with gaap and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties  all of which have real economic effects and could materially and adversely impact our results of operations 
therefore  the utility of noi as a measure of our performance is limited 
additionally  other companies  including other equity reits  may use different methodologies for calculating noi and  accordingly  noi as disclosed by such other companies may not be comparable to noi published herein 
we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our historical operating results  noi should be examined in conjunction with net income loss as presented in the consolidated and combined financial statements accompanying this report 
noi should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss attributable to common stockholders as an indicator of our properties financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to pay dividends or make distribution 
development  construction and management services development and construction services 
in addition to our wholly owned properties  all of which were developed and built by us  we also provide development and construction services to unconsolidated joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest 
we act as a general contractor on all of our construction projects 
when building properties for our own account ie  for entities that are consolidated in our financial statements  construction revenues and expenses are eliminated for accounting purposes and construction costs are ultimately reflected as capital additions 
thus  building properties for our own account does not generate any revenues or expenses in our development  construction and management services segment on a consolidated basis 
alternatively  when performing these services for unconsolidated joint ventures  we recognize construction revenues based on the costs that have been contractually agreed to with the joint venture for the construction of the property and expenses based on the actual costs incurred 
construction revenues are recognized using the percentage of completion method  as determined by construction costs incurred relative to total estimated construction costs  as adjusted to eliminate our proportionate ownership of each entity 
actual construction costs are expensed as incurred and are likewise adjusted to eliminate our proportionate ownership of each entity 
operating income generated by our development and construction activities generally reflects the development fee and construction fee income that is realized by providing these services to unconsolidated joint ventures ie  the spread between the contractual cost of construction and the actual cost of construction 
management services 
in addition to our wholly owned properties  all of which are managed by us  we also provide management services to unconsolidated joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest 
we recognize management fees from these entities as earned in accordance with the property management agreement with these entities  as adjusted to eliminate our proportionate ownership of each entity 
we have set forth a discussion comparing the consolidated results for year ended december  to the consolidated results of our operations for the year ended december  additionally  we have set forth a discussion comparing consolidated results for year ended december  to the combined operating results of our operations for the period from october  through december   and the predecessor s historical results of operations for the period from january  through october  the historical results of operations presented below should be reviewed in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
comparison of years ended december  and december  as of december   our property portfolio consisted of consolidated operating properties  containing approximately  apartment units and  beds and seven operating properties held in three unconsolidated joint ventures  containing approximately  apartment units and  beds 
the following table presents our results of operations for the periods presented  including the amount and percentage change in these results between the periods in thousands year ended year ended december  december  change change revenues student housing rental    student housing services   development  construction and management services  total revenues    operating expenses student housing operations    development  construction and management services  general and administrative    ground leases depreciation and amortization    total operating expenses    equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated entities operating income    nonoperating income expense interest expense    change in fair value of interest rate derivatives other income expense gain on purchase of previously unconsolidated interests  total nonoperating expense    net income before income taxes    income tax expense net income    net income attributable to noncontrolling interests dividends on preferred stock   n a net income attributable to common stockholders and owner  student housing operations revenues in the student housing operations segment which include student housing rental and student housing service revenues increased by approximately million and operating expenses in the student housing operations segment increased by approximately million in  as compared to the increase in revenues was primarily due to the opening of three new properties in august  the acquisitions of the grove at valdosta and the grove at moscow in july  the acquisitions of the grove at huntsville and the grove at statesboro in december  the inclusion of operating results for our august deliveries for a full calendar year in as well as increases in occupancy and monthly revenue per bed at our same store properties 
the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the aforementioned activity as well as an increase in same store property level payroll and taxes which was partially offset by a decrease in same store property level utilities and in general office expenses 
new property operations 
in august  we began operations at the grove at auburn  the grove at flagstaff and the grove at orono  which contributed approximately million in noi for the year ended december  compared to no contribution for the year ended december  in july  we acquired the remaining ownership interests in the grove at valdosta and the grove at moscow which contributed approximately million of noi for the year ended december   compared to no contribution for the year ended december  prior to the acquisition of these interests  we accounted for our ownership in this property under the equity method 
in december  we acquired the remaining ownership interests in the grove at huntsville and the grove at statesboro which contributed approximately million of noi for the year ended december   as compared to an immaterial amount of noi for the year ended december  prior to the acquisition of these interests  we accounted for our ownership in this property under the equity method 
in august  we began operations at the grove at ames  the grove at clarksville  the grove at columbia and the grove at fort wayne which contributed approximately million in noi for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million in noi for the year ended december  same store property operations 
our same store properties contributed approximately million of noi for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million of noi for the year ended december  the increase in revenue at our same store properties was due to an increase in the average occupancy to approximately for the year ended december  from approximately for the year ended december  and an increase in average monthly revenue per occupied bed revpob to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in operating expenses were primarily due to property level payroll and taxes which was partially offset by decreases in same store property level utilities and general office expenses

we eliminate revenue and related expenses on such transactions with our unconsolidated entities to the extent of our ownership interest 
the increase in development  construction and management services revenue and operating expenses were primarily due to a higher volume of unconsolidated service activity and the timing of that service activity 
during the year ended december   we completed construction on three joint venture projects for which we had a ownership interest and began construction on three additional joint venture projects for which we had a ownership interest 
during the year ended december   we completed construction on two joint venture projects for which we had a ownership interest and began construction on three additional joint venture projects for which we had a ownership interest 
although we remain in the early stages of our construction cycle for our current round of developments  we believe our current round of developments will be materially in line with our expectations 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  the million increase was primarily due to an increase in number of employees and travel expenses resulting from our growth 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased from approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the increased number of aforementioned operating properties 
equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated entities equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated entities  which represents our share of the net income loss from entities in which we have a noncontrolling interest  increased to a gain of approximately million for the year ended december  from a loss of approximately million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the addition of three unconsolidated properties commencing operations in august and two unconsolidated properties commencing operations in august  offset by our acquisition of the remaining ownership interests in the grove at valdosta and the grove at moscow in july and the grove at huntsville and the grove at statesboro in december the increase was also due to refinancing initiatives during the fourth quarter that resulted in lower interest expense and an increase in return on our preferred investments 
nonoperating income expense interest expense 
interest expense increased approximately million to approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in outstanding indebtedness during as compared to resulting from an increase in the number of operating properties as well as an increase in write offs of deferred financing costs due to re financing activities 
change in fair value of interest rate derivatives 
the fair value of interest rate derivatives decreased to a loss of approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to a gain of approximately million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in non cash mark to market adjustments of approximately million combined with an increase in monthly net cash settlements of approximately million 
other income expense 
other income expense decreased approximately million from a gain of approximately million for the year ended december  to a loss of approximately million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to interest income earned in on cash balances  which was not earned in gain on purchase of previously unconsolidated interests 
the gain for the year ended december  was due to our acquisition of the remaining ownership interests in the grove at valdosta and the grove at moscow and our associated re measurement of those interests 
the gain for the year ended december  was due to our acquisition of the remaining ownership interests in the grove at huntsville and the grove at statesboro and our associated re measurement of those interests 
income taxes income tax expense in was relatively unchanged compared to at approximately million and approximately million  respectively  due to comparable levels in service activity by our trss 
we managed seven unconsolidated joint venture properties during as compared to nine unconsolidated joint venture properties during the same period in the prior year 
dividends on preferred stock dividends on preferred stock increased to approximately million for the year ended december  compared to zero for the year ended december  we had preferred stock outstanding during the year ended december  whereas no such equity was outstanding during the year ended december  cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million 
approximately million was used by working capital purposes for the year ended december  as compared to approximately million used by working capital accounts for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the payments into restricted cash accounts required by our lenders and an increase in construction related receivables  partially offset by an increase in outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses 
we also added three wholly owned and three joint venture properties for the year ended december  along with receiving a full year benefit of the four wholly owned and two joint venture deliveries from we also acquired two joint venture properties in december and two additional joint venture properties in july these factors  along with increased occupancy at our existing properties contributed to the increase in cash flows of operating activities 
net cash used in investing activities totaled approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to net cash used of approximately million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million 
this increase was primarily due to expenditures on development projects  contributions to joint ventures and the acquisition of the grove at valdosta and the grove at moscow during net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to net cash provided of approximately million for the year ended december   a decrease of approximately million 
this decrease was primarily due to the net financing activity resulting from increased draws and the repayment of our line of credit  mortgage and construction notes  partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of preferred and common stock 
comparison of years ended december  and december  as of december   our property portfolio consisted of consolidated operating properties  containing approximately  apartment units and  beds and six operating properties held in two unconsolidated joint ventures  containing approximately  apartment units and  beds

this increase was partially offset by decreases in property level marketing expenses  repairs and maintenance and payroll

we eliminate revenue and related expenses on such transactions with our unconsolidated entities to the extent of our ownership interest 
the decrease in development  construction and management services revenues and operating expenses in was primarily due to decreased construction activity in as compared to as we had construction activity on two unconsolidated joint venture properties in in which we owned a interest compared to three unconsolidated joint venture properties through october  in which we owned a interest 
this decrease was only partially offset by the fourth quarter construction activity for three additional unconsolidated joint venture properties  in which we own a interest 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses in for the year ended december  were relatively unchanged compared to the year ended december  at million and million  respectively 
write off of pre development costs write off of pre development costs were zero for the year ended december  and million in for the year ended december  as a result of events that occurred in which led management to conclude that certain pre development projects would not result in either the acquisition of a site or commencement of construction 
as of december   all pre development prospects remained probable 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately million  from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of our operating properties described above 
equity in loss of unconsolidated entities equity in loss of unconsolidated entities  which represents our share of the net loss from entities in which we have a noncontrolling interest  increased from a loss of approximately million for the year ended december  to a loss of approximately million for the year ended december  this million increase was primarily due to an increase in our ownership interest to in hsre i upon the completion of the offering in october  the addition of three new properties owned by hsre i that commenced operations in august and had a full year of operations during  two additional properties owned by hsre iv that commenced operations in august and interest in our preferred investments 
these losses were primarily driven by the ventures depreciation expense 
nonoperating income expense interest expense 
interest expense decreased approximately million  from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  primarily due to a decrease in outstanding indebtedness during  which resulted from the change in our capital structure as a result of the offering and formation transactions in october change in fair value of interest rate derivatives 
change in fair value of interest rate derivatives decreased from a gain of approximately million for the year ended december  to a gain of approximately million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in non cash mark to market adjustments of approximately million  offset by a decrease in monthly net cash settlements of approximately million 
other income expense other income expense increased approximately million  from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to interest income earned on preferred investments for a full year 
the remaining increase was related to interest income earned in on cash balances 
gain on purchase of previously unconsolidated interests 
the gain for the year ended december  is due to our acquisition of the remaining ownership interests in the grove at huntsville and the grove at statesboro and our associated re measurement of those interests 
the gain for the year ended december  was due to our acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in the grove at san marcos and our associated re measurement of that interest

this increase was primarily due to increased net financing proceeds associated with our development projects for the academic year 
liquidity and capital resources our capital resources include accessing the public debt and equity markets  when available  mortgage and construction loan financing and immediate access to the amended credit facility discussed below 
as a reit  we generally must distribute annually at least of our reit taxable income  excluding any net capital gain  in order for corporate income tax not to apply to earnings that we distribute 
to the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement  but distribute less than of our reit taxable income  we will be subject to us federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income 
in addition  we will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we distribute to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under us federal income tax laws 
we intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the requirements of the internal revenue code and to avoid paying corporate tax on undistributed income 
additionally  we intend to make distributions that exceed these requirements 
we may need to obtain financing to meet our distribution requirements because our income may not be matched by our related expenses at the time the income is considered received for purposes of determining taxable income  and non deductible capital expenditures  creation of reserves or debt service requirements may reduce available cash but not taxable income 
in these circumstances  we may be forced to obtain third party financing on terms we might otherwise find unfavorable  and we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing 
alternatively  if we are unable or unwilling to obtain third party financing on the available terms  we could choose to pay a portion of our distributions in stock instead of cash  or we may fund distributions through asset sales 
principal capital resources in january  we entered into the second amended and restated credit agreement with citibank  na and certain other lenders see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated and combined financial statements in this form k 
the second amended and restated credit agreement provides for the revolving credit facility of up to million  with sub limits of million for swing line loans and million for letters of credit 
the second amended and restated credit agreement also provides for the term loan of million 
as of january   we had approximately million outstanding under our revolving credit facility and million outstanding under the term loan 
the amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and term loan  as well as outstanding letters of credit  will reduce the amount that we may be able to borrow under this facility for other purposes 
as of january   we had approximately million in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility  and amounts borrowed under the facility will be due at its maturity in january  subject to a one year extension  which we may exercise at our option  pursuant to certain terms and conditions  including the payment of an extension fee 
the amount available for us to borrow under the amended credit facility is based on the sum of a the lesser of i of the as is appraised value of our properties that form the borrowing base of the amended credit facility and ii the amount that would create a debt service coverage ratio of not less than  and b of the aggregate of the lesser of i the book value of each of our development assets as such term is defined in the second amended and restated credit agreement and ii the as is appraised value of each of our development assets  subject to certain limitations in the second amended and restated credit agreement 
additionally  the amended credit facility has an accordion feature that allows us to request an increase in the total commitments from million to million  subject to conditions 
amounts outstanding under the amended credit facility bear interest at a floating rate equal to  at our election  the eurodollar rate or the base rate each as defined in the second amended and restated credit agreement plus a spread that depends upon our leverage ratio 
the spread for borrowings under the revolving credit facility ranges from to for eurodollar rate based borrowings and from to for base rate based borrowings  and the spread for the term loan ranges from to for eurodollar rate based borrowings and from to for base rate based borrowings 
our ability to borrow under the amended credit facility is subject to its ongoing compliance with a number of customary financial covenants  including a maximum leverage ratio of not greater than  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than  a minimum ratio of fixed rate debt and debt subject to hedge agreements to total debt of not less than  a maximum secured recourse debt ratio of not greater than  a minimum tangible net worth of not less than the sum of  plus an amount equal to of the net proceeds of any additional equity issuances  and a maximum secured debt ratio of not greater than through february  and not greater than on any date thereafter 
pursuant to the terms of the amended credit facility  we may not pay distributions that exceed the greater of i of our funds from operations  or ii the minimum amount required for us to qualify and maintain our status as a reit 
if a default or event of default occurs and is continuing  we also may be precluded from making certain distributions other than those required to allow us to qualify and maintain our status as a reit 
we and certain of our subsidiaries guarantee the obligations under the amended credit facility and we and certain of our subsidiaries have provided a negative pledge against specified assets including real property  stock and other interests 
as of december   we were in compliance with the above financial covenants with respect to our amended credit facility 
in february  we amended the second amended and restated credit agreement held with citibank  na and certain other lenders to provide for certain exclusions related to our investments in joint ventures as well as the treatment of certain other investments within the compliance calculation of our secured debt ratio and certain negative covenants 
in november  we filed a shelf registration statement which was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission sec on december  and provides for the ability to issue up to million of debt and equity securities 
in february  we completed an underwritten public offering of approximately million shares of our series a preferred stock  including approximately million shares issued and sold pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters overallotment option in full see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated and combined financial statements in this form k 
in july  we issued approximately million shares of common stock  including the full exercise of the underwriters option to purchase additional shares see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated and combined financial statements in this form k 
short term liquidity needs we believe that we will have sufficient capital resources as a result of operations and the borrowings in place to fund ongoing operations and distributions required to maintain reit compliance 
we anticipate using our cash flow from continuing operations  cash and cash equivalents  and amended credit facility availability to fund our business operations  cash dividends and distributions  debt amortization  and recurring capital expenditures 
capital requirements for significant acquisitions and development projects may require funding from borrowings and or equity offerings 
recurring capital expenditures our properties require periodic investments of capital for general maintenance 
these recurring capital expenditures vary in size annually based upon the nature of the maintenance required for that time period 
for example  recently developed properties typically do not require major maintenance such as the replacement of a roof 
in addition  capital expenditures associated with newly acquired or developed properties are capitalized as part of their acquisition price or development budget  so that such properties typically begin to require recurring capital expenditures only following their first year of ownership 
our historical recurring capital expenditures at our consolidated properties are set forth below in thousands  except average per bed amount year ended december  the company and the company predecessor investment in wholly owned developments   acquisition of previously unconsolidated entities  capital improvements    recurring capital expenditures  investment in operating properties    total beds as of january    average per bed total number of beds as of january of the year indicated  excluding beds at consolidated properties that commenced operations during the year indicated  as they did not require material recurring capital expenditures 
we invested approximately million  million and million in wholly owned developments for the years ended december    and  respectively 
in  we completed construction on three development projects and began construction on another three projects targeted for completion in the third quarter of in  we completed construction on four development projects and began construction on another three projects targeted for completion in the third quarter of in  we began construction on four projects targeted for completion in the third quarter of we have increased the number of projects under construction over time as our access to capital has increased 
going forward  our scope and number of projects will be contingent upon our access to capital among other factors 
we invested approximately million  million and million in our operating properties for the years ended december    and  respectively 
in  we acquired the remaining ownership interests in two previously unconsolidated joint ventures campus crest at valdosta gp  llc and campus crest at moscow  llc for approximately million with the remainder for various capital improvements at our wholly owned properties 
in  we acquired the remaining ownership interests in three previously unconsolidated joint ventures campus crest at huntsville i gp  llc  campus crest at huntsville ii gp  llc and campus crest at statesboro  llc for approximately million with the remainder for various capital improvements at our wholly owned properties 
in  we acquired the remaining ownership interest in a previously unconsolidated joint venture campus crest at san marcos gp  llc for approximately million with the remainder for various capital improvements 
capital improvements at our wholly owned properties include betterments to buildings  clubhouse renovations  parking lots  solar panel installations and other capital improvements 
we expect to consider acquiring additional joint venture ownership interests going forward 
we also expect our capital improvements and recurring capital expenditures to increase over time as our portfolio expands 
development expenditures our development activities have historically required us to fund pre development expenditures such as architectural fees  engineering fees and earnest deposits 
because the closing of a development project s financing is often subject to various delays  we cannot always predict accurately the liquidity needs of these activities 
we frequently incur these pre development expenditures before a financing commitment has been obtained and  accordingly  bear the risk of the loss of these pre development expenditures if financing cannot ultimately be arranged on acceptable terms 
we are building six new student housing properties  three of which are wholly owned by us and three of which are owned by hsre vi  a joint venture that we established with hsre  and in which we own a interest 
we are currently targeting completion of these six properties for the academic year 
for each of these projects  we commenced construction subsequent to conducting significant pre development activities 
we estimate that the cost to complete all three wholly owned properties will be approximately million 
additionally  we will be obligated to fund our pro rata portion of the development costs of our joint venture with hsre  and we estimate that the cost to complete the three joint venture properties will be approximately million and our net pro rata share of equity will be approximately million 
no assurance can be given that we will complete construction of these six properties in accordance with our current expectations including the estimated cost thereof 
during  we closed on all financing necessary for our six development projects 
we intend to finance our share of the remaining construction costs through the revolving credit facility 
we are also building one new student housing property of which is owned by hsre ix  a joint venture that we established with hsre and brandywine  in which we own a interest 
we are currently targeting completion of this property for the academic year 
we estimate that the cost to complete this joint venture property to be approximately million and our net pro rata share of equity will be approximately million 
no assurance can be given that we will complete construction of this property in accordance with our current expectations including the estimated cost thereof 
during january  we closed on our financing necessary for this development project 
we intend to finance our share of the construction costs through the revolving credit facility 
long term liquidity needs our long term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for long term development activities  non recurring capital expenditures  potential acquisitions of properties and payments of debt at maturity 
long term liquidity needs may also include the payment of unexpected contingencies  such as remediation of unknown environmental conditions at our properties or at additional properties that we develop or acquire  or renovations necessary to comply with the ada or other regulatory requirements 
we do not expect that we will have sufficient funds on hand to cover all of our long term liquidity needs 
we will therefore seek to satisfy these needs through cash flow from operations  additional long term secured and unsecured debt  including borrowings under our revolving credit facility  the issuance of debt securities  the issuance of equity securities and equity related securities including op units  property dispositions and joint venture transactions 
we believe that we will have access to these sources of capital to fund our long term liquidity requirements  but we cannot make any assurance that this will be the case  especially in difficult market conditions

off balance sheet arrangements hsre joint ventures we have investments in real estate ventures with hsre  which are not consolidated by us and were not combined by our predecessor 
these joint ventures are engaged primarily in developing  constructing  owning and managing student housing properties in the united states

funds from operations ffo ffo is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating performance measure for reits 
we calculate ffo in accordance with the definition that was adopted by the board of governors of nareit 
ffo  as defined by nareit  represents net income loss determined in accordance with gaap  excluding extraordinary items as defined under gaap and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets  plus specified non cash items  such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
in addition  in october  nareit communicated to its members that the exclusion of impairment write downs of depreciable real estate is consistent with the definition of ffo 
we use ffo as a supplemental performance measure because  in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions  it provides a performance measure that  when compared year over year  captures trends in occupancy rates  rental rates and operating expenses 
we also believe that  as a widely recognized measure of the performance of equity reits  ffo will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other reits 
however  because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties  all of which have real economic effects and could materially and adversely impact our results of operations  the utility of ffo as a measure of our performance is limited 
while ffo is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of equity reits  other equity reits may use different methodologies for calculating ffo and  accordingly  ffo as disclosed by such other reits may not be comparable to ffo published herein 
therefore  we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our historical operating results  ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income loss as presented in the consolidated and combined financial statements accompanying this report 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our properties financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions 
the following table presents a reconciliation of our ffo to our net income loss for the periods presented in thousands the company predecessor october  january  year ended year ended through through december  december  december  october in thousands funds from operations ffo net income loss attributable to common stockholders  net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests gain on purchase of joint venture properties  real estate related depreciation and amortization  real estate related depreciation and amortization unconsolidated joint ventures   ffo     for  gain is from the purchase of our joint venture partner s interest in the grove at moscow and the grove at valdosta  for  gain is from the purchase of our joint venture partner s interest in the grove at huntsville and the grove at statesboro  for  gain is from the purchase of our joint venture partner s interest in the grove at san marcos 
in addition to ffo  we believe it is also a meaningful measure of our performance to adjust ffo to exclude the change in fair value of interest rate derivatives  write off of unamortized deferred financing fees and the write off of development costs 
excluding the change in fair value of interest rate derivatives  write off of unamortized deferred financing fees and development cost write offs adjusts ffo to be more reflective of operating results prior to capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligations or other commitments and contingencies 
this measure is referred to herein as ffoa 
the company predecessor october  january  year ended year ended through through december  december  december  october ffo     elimination of change in fair value of interest rate derivatives elimination of write off of unamortized deferred financing fees elimination of development cost write off funds from operations adjusted ffoa   includes only the noncash portion of the change in unhedged derivatives 
inflation our student housing leases typically do not have terms that extend beyond months 
accordingly  although on a short term basis we would be required to bear the impact of rising costs resulting from inflation  we have the opportunity to raise rental rates at least annually to offset any rising costs 
however  our ability to raise rental rates could be limited by a weak economic environment  declining student enrollment at our principal colleges and universities or competition in the marketplace

for debt obligations  the table presents scheduled maturities and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates in thousands thereafter total fixed rate debt     weighted average interest rate variable rate debt   weighted average interest rate total      in january  we amended our credit facility  thereby extending the maturity date to january  subject to a one year extension option 
see note to the accompanying consolidated and combined financial statements 
the table above presents the principal amount of debt maturing each year through december  and thereafter and weighted average interest rates for the debt maturing in each specified period 
this table reflects indebtedness outstanding as of december  and does not reflect indebtedness incurred after that date 
our ultimate exposure to interest rate fluctuations depends on the amount of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates  the time at which the interest rate is adjusted  the amount of adjustment  the ability to prepay or refinance variable rate indebtedness and hedging strategies used to reduce the impact of any increases in rates 
as of december   the estimated fair value of our construction loans and fixed rate mortgage debt was million 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
we seek to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower the overall borrowing costs by closely monitoring our variable rate debt and converting such debt to fixed rates when we deem such conversion advantageous 
as of december   approximately million of our aggregate indebtedness of total indebtedness was subject to variable interest rates 
if market rates of interest on our variable rate long term debt fluctuate by  interest cost would increase or decrease  depending on rate movement  future earnings and cash flows by approximately million annually 
this assumes that the amount outstanding under our variable rate debt remains at million  the balance as of december  we do and may in the future  continue to use derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risks related to such variable rate borrowings 
we do not  and do not expect to  use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes  and we expect to enter into contracts only with major financial institutions
