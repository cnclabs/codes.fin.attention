item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our business the kroger co 
was founded in and incorporated in it is one of the nation s largest retailers  as measured by revenue  operating  supermarket and multi department stores under two dozen banners including kroger  city market  dillons  jay c  food less  fred meyer  fry s  king soopers  qfc  ralphs and smith s 
of these stores   have fuel centers 
we also operate convenience stores  either directly or through franchisees  and fine jewelry stores 
kroger operates manufacturing plants  primarily bakeries and dairies  which supply approximately of the corporate brand units sold in our retail outlets 
our revenues are earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores 
we earn income predominately by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of the costs we incur to make these products available to our customers 
such costs include procurement and distribution costs  facility occupancy and operational costs  and overhead expenses 
our retail operations  which represent over of kroger s consolidated sales and ebitda  are our only reportable segment 
our performance we achieved outstanding results in our business strategy continues to resonate with a full range of customers and our results reflect the balance we seek to achieve across our business including positive identical sales growth  increases in loyal household count  and good cost control  as well as growth in net earnings and net earnings per diluted share 
our net earnings were billion or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share for the same period of for  this includes estimated net earnings of million pre tax million after tax or per diluted share due to a rd week in fiscal year the extra week 
in addition  net earnings benefited by million pre tax million after tax or per diluted share from a settlement with visa and mastercard and from a reduction in our obligation to fund the united food and commercial workers international union ufcw consolidated pension fund created in january excluding the visa and mastercard settlement  the ufcw consolidated pension fund adjustment and the extra week in  our adjusted net earnings were billion or per diluted share 
our results included a charge related to the consolidation of four multi employer pension plans to the ufcw consolidated pension plan totaling million  pre tax million after tax 
excluding the adjusted item  our adjusted net earnings were billion or per diluted share 
after accounting for these adjusted items  our adjusted net earnings per diluted share represent a increase in adjusted net earnings per diluted share 
please refer to the net earnings section for more information related to the increase in net earnings for  compared to our identical supermarket sales increased by  excluding fuel in we have achieved consecutive quarters of positive identical supermarket sales growth  excluding fuel 
as we continue to outpace many of our competitors on identical supermarket sales growth  we continue to gain market share 
we focus on identical supermarket sales growth  excluding fuel  because our business model emphasizes this primary component 
increasing market share is an important part of our long term strategy as it best reflects how our products and services resonate with customers 
market share growth allows us to spread the fixed costs in our business over a wider revenue base 
our fundamental operating philosophy is to maintain and increase market share by offering customers good prices and superior products and service 
based on nielsen homescan data  our estimated market share increased in total by approximately basis points in across our marketing areas outlined by the nielsen report 
this information also indicates that our market share increased in of the marketing areas and declined in nine 
wal mart supercenters are a primary competitor in of these marketing areas 
in these marketing areas  our market share increased in nine and declined in eight 
nielsen homescan data is generated by customers who self report their grocery purchases to nielsen  regardless of retail channel or grocery outlet 
these market share results reflect our long term strategy of market share growth 
results of operations the following discussion summarizes our operating results for compared to and for compared to comparability is affected by income and expense items that fluctuated significantly between and among the periods and an extra week in net earnings net earnings totaled billion in  million in and billion in the net earnings for include benefits from net earnings of approximately million  after tax  for the extra week  a million  after tax  settlement with visa and mastercard and a reduction in our obligation to fund the ufcw consolidated pension fund created in january adjusted items 
the net earnings for include a ufcw consolidated pension plan charge totaling million  after tax adjusted item 
the net earnings for include a non cash goodwill impairment charge totaling million  after tax  related to a small number of stores adjusted item 
excluding these benefits and charges for adjusted items in  and  adjusted net earnings were billion in  billion in and billion in adjusted net earnings improved  compared to  due to an increase in first in  first out fifo non fuel operating profit  increased net earnings from our fuel operations and a last in  first out lifo charge of million pre tax  compared to a lifo charge of million pre tax in  partially offset by increased interest expense and income tax expense 
adjusted net earnings improved  compared to  due to an increase in fifo non fuel operating profit  lower interest expense  favorable resolutions for certain tax issues and higher retail fuel margins  partially offset by a lifo charge of million pre tax  compared to a lifo charge of million pre tax in net earnings per diluted share totaled  and adjusted net earnings per diluted share in totaled  which excludes the adjusted items 
net earnings per diluted share totaled  and adjusted net earnings per diluted share in totaled  which excludes the adjusted item 
net earnings per diluted share totaled  and adjusted net earnings per diluted share in totaled  which excludes the adjusted item 
adjusted net earnings per diluted share in  compared to  increased primarily due to fewer shares outstanding as a result of the repurchase of kroger common shares  increased fifo non fuel operating profit  increased net earnings from our fuel operations and a decrease in the lifo charge to million pre tax  compared to a lifo charge of million pre tax in  partially offset by increased interest expense and income tax expense 
adjusted net earnings per diluted share in  compared to  increased primarily due to increased retail fuel margins  the repurchase of kroger common shares  increased fifo non fuel operating profit  and the favorable resolution of certain tax issues  offset by a lifo charge of million pre tax  compared to a lifo charge of million pre tax in management believes adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share are useful metrics to investors and analysts because the amounts referenced above in net earnings and net earnings per diluted share are not directly related to our day to day business 
adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share are non generally accepted accounting principle non gaap financial measures and should not be considered alternatives to net earnings and net earnings per diluted share or any other generally accepted accounting principle gaap measure of performance 
adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share should not be reviewed in isolation or considered substitutes for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap 
management uses adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share as it believes these measures are more meaningful indicators of ongoing operating performance since  as adjusted  those earnings relate more directly to our day to day operations 
management also uses adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share to measure our progress against internal budgets and targets 
in addition  management takes into account adjusted net earnings when calculating management incentive programs

we define a supermarket as identical when it has been in operation without expansion or relocation for five full quarters 
fuel discounts received at our fuel centers and earned based on in store purchases are included in all of the supermarket identical sales results calculations illustrated below and reduce our identical supermarket sales results 
differences between total supermarket sales and identical supermarket sales primarily relate to changes in supermarket square footage 
identical supermarket sales include sales from all departments at identical fred meyer multi department stores 
we calculate annualized identical supermarket sales by adding together four quarters of identical supermarket sales 
our identical supermarket sales results are summarized in the table below  based on the week period of  compared to the previous year results adjusted to a comparable week period 
identical supermarket sales dollars in millions including supermarket fuel centers excluding supermarket fuel centers including supermarket fuel centers excluding supermarket fuel centers identical supermarket sales for were adjusted to a comparable week basis by including week of fiscal in our identical supermarket sales base

retail fuel sales lower our gross margin rate due to the very low gross margin on retail fuel sales as compared to non fuel sales 
we calculate fifo gross margin as sales minus merchandise costs  including advertising  warehousing  and transportation expenses  but excluding the lifo charge 
merchandise costs exclude depreciation and rent expenses 
our lifo charge was million in  million in and million in fifo gross margin is a non gaap financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to gross margin or any other gaap measure of performance 
fifo gross margin should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap 
fifo gross margin is an important measure used by management to evaluate merchandising and operational effectiveness 
management believes fifo gross margin is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures our day to day merchandising and operational effectiveness 
our fifo gross margin rates  as a percentage of sales  were in  in and in retail fuel sales lower our fifo gross margin rate due to the very low fifo gross margin on retail fuel sales as compared to non fuel sales

we calculate fifo operating profit as operating profit excluding the lifo charge 
fifo operating profit is a non gaap financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to operating profit or any other gaap measure of performance 
fifo operating profit should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap 
fifo operating profit is an important measure used by management to evaluate operational effectiveness 
management believes fifo operating profit is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures our day to day operational effectiveness 
since fuel discounts are earned based on in store purchases  fuel operating profit does not include fuel discounts  which are allocated to our in store supermarket location departments 
we also derive operating  general and administrative expenses  rent and depreciation and amortization through the use of estimated allocations in the calculation of fuel operating profit 
fifo operating profit was billion in  billion in and billion in excluding the extra week  fifo operating profit was billion in fifo operating profit  as a percentage of sales  was in  in and in fifo operating profit  as a percentage of sales excluding the extra week  was in fifo operating profit  excluding the  and adjusted items  was billion in  billion in and billion in fifo operating profit  excluding the extra week and the adjusted items  was billion in fifo operating profit  as a percentage of sales excluding the  and adjusted items  was in  in and in fifo operating profit  excluding the extra week and the adjusted items  was in retail fuel sales lower our overall fifo operating profit rate due to the very low fifo operating profit rate  as a percentage of sales  of retail fuel sales compared to non fuel sales

common share repurchase program we maintain share repurchase programs that comply with securities exchange act rule b and allow for the orderly repurchase of our common shares  from time to time 
we made open market purchases of kroger common shares totaling billion in  billion in and million in under these repurchase programs 
in addition to these repurchase programs  we also repurchase common shares to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans 
this program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises  and the tax benefit from these exercises 
we repurchased approximately million in  million in  and million in of kroger shares under the stock option program 
the shares reacquired in were reacquired under four separate share repurchase programs 
the first is a billion repurchase program that was authorized by kroger s board of directors on september  the second is a billion repurchase program that was authorized by kroger s board of directors on june   that replaced the first referenced program 
the third is a million repurchase program that was authorized by kroger s board of directors on october   that replaced the second referenced program 
the fourth is a program that uses the cash proceeds from the exercises of stock options by participants in kroger s stock option and long term incentive plans as well as the associated tax benefits 
as of february   we had million remaining on the october  million share repurchase program

adjusted operating profit is calculated by excluding certain items included in operating profit  and adding our lifo charge  depreciation and amortization and rent 
average invested capital is calculated as the sum of i the average of our total assets  ii the average lifo reserve  iii the average accumulated depreciation and amortization and iv a rent factor equal to total rent for the last four quarters multiplied by a factor of eight  minus i the average taxes receivable  ii the average trade accounts payable  iii the average accrued salaries and wages and iv the average other current liabilities 
averages are calculated for return on invested capital by adding the beginning balance of the first quarter and the ending balance of the fourth quarter  of the last four quarters  and dividing by two 
we use a factor of eight for our total rent as we believe this is a common factor used by our investors and analysts 
roic is a non gaap financial measure of performance 
roic should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as a substitute for our financial results as reported in accordance with gaap 
roic is an important measure used by management to evaluate our investment returns on capital 
management believes roic is a useful metric to investors and analysts because it measures how effectively we are deploying our assets 
all items included in the calculation of roic are gaap measures  excluding certain adjustments to operating income 
although roic is a relatively standard financial term  numerous methods exist for calculating a company s roic 
as a result  the method used by our management to calculate roic may differ from methods other companies use to calculate their roic 
we urge you to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate their roic before comparing our roic to that of such other companies 
the following table provides a calculation of roic for and on a week basis in millions february  january  return on invested capital numerator operating profit on a week basis in fiscal year rd week operating profit adjustment lifo charge depreciation and amortization rent on a week basis in fiscal year rd week rent adjustment adjusted item adjusted items adjusted operating profit denominator average total assets average taxes receivable average lifo reserve average accumulated depreciation and amortization average trade accounts payable average accrued salaries and wages average other current liabilities rent x average invested capital return on invested capital taxes receivable were as of february  and as of january  as of january   the company did not have any taxes receivable 
other current liabilities included accrued income taxes of as of february  and as of january  as of january   other current liabilities did not include any accrued income taxes 
accrued income taxes are removed from other current liabilities in the calculation of average invested capital 
critical accounting policies we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position  and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
self insurance costs we primarily are self insured for costs related to workers compensation and general liability claims 
the liabilities represent our best estimate  using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods  of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through february  we establish case reserves for reported claims using case basis evaluation of the underlying claim data and we update as information becomes known 
for both workers compensation and general liability claims  we have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis 
we are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits 
we account for the liabilities for workers compensation claims on a present value basis utilizing a risk adjusted discount rate 
a basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase our liability by approximately million 
general liability claims are not discounted 
the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability  which can affect the liability recorded for such claims 
for example  variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized 
similarly  changes in legal trends and interpretations  as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can affect ultimate costs 
our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables  and any changes could have a considerable effect on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities 
impairments of long lived assets we monitor the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger events have occurred 
these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset 
when a trigger event occurs  we perform an impairment calculation  comparing projected undiscounted cash flows  utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores  to the carrying value for those stores 
if we identify impairment for long lived assets to be held and used  we compare the assets current carrying value to the assets fair value 
fair value is determined based on market values or discounted future cash flows 
we record impairment when the carrying value exceeds fair market value 
with respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal  we adjust the value of the property and equipment to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions 
we recognize impairment for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value  reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal 
we recorded asset impairments in the normal course of business totaling million in  million in and million in we record costs to reduce the carrying value of long lived assets in the consolidated statements of operations as operating  general and administrative expense 
the factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows 
our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation  the economy and market competition 
application of alternative assumptions and definitions  such as reviewing long lived assets for impairment at a different level  could produce significantly different results 
goodwill our goodwill totaled billion as of february  we review goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year  and also upon the occurrence of triggering events 
we perform reviews of each of our operating divisions and variable interest entities collectively  our reporting units with goodwill balances 
fair value is determined using a multiple of earnings  or discounted projected future cash flows  and we compare fair value to the carrying value of a reporting unit for purposes of identifying potential impairment 
we base projected future cash flows on management s knowledge of the current operating environment and expectations for the future 
if we identify potential for impairment  we measure the fair value of a reporting unit against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities  excluding goodwill  to estimate an implied fair value of the division s goodwill 
we recognize goodwill impairment for any excess of the carrying value of the division s goodwill over the implied fair value 
the annual evaluation of goodwill performed during the fourth quarter of and did not result in impairment 
the annual evaluation of goodwill performed during the fourth quarter of resulted in an impairment charge of million 
based on the results of our step one analysis in the fourth quarter of  a supermarket reporting unit with a small number of stores indicated potential impairment 
due to estimated future expected cash flows being lower than in the past  our estimated fair value of the reporting unit decreased 
we concluded that the carrying value of goodwill for this reporting unit exceeded its implied fair value  resulting in a pre tax impairment charge of million million after tax 
in  we disclosed that a reduction in fair value of this supermarket reporting unit would indicate a potential for impairment 
subsequent to the impairment  no goodwill remains at this reporting unit 
based on current and future expected cash flows  we believe goodwill impairments are not reasonably possible 
a reduction in fair value of our reporting units would not indicate a potential for impairment of our goodwill balance 
for additional information relating to our results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during  and see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the impairment review requires the extensive use of management judgment and financial estimates 
application of alternative estimates and assumptions  such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different level  could produce significantly different results 
the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several factors such as inflation  business valuations in the market  the economy and market competition 
store closing costs we provide for closed store liabilities on the basis of the present value of the estimated remaining non cancellable lease payments after the closing date  net of estimated subtenant income 
we estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores 
we usually pay closed store lease liabilities over the lease terms associated with the closed stores  which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to years 
adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates 
we make adjustments for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known 
we review store closing liabilities quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs  or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose  is adjusted to earnings in the proper period 
we estimate subtenant income  future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located  our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions 
the ultimate cost of the disposition of the leases and the related assets is affected by current real estate markets  inflation rates and general economic conditions 
we reduce owned stores held for disposal to their estimated net realizable value 
we account for costs to reduce the carrying values of property  equipment and leasehold improvements in accordance with our policy on impairment of long lived assets 
we classify inventory write downs in connection with store closings  if any  in merchandise costs 
we expense costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores as they are incurred 
post retirement benefit plans we account for our defined benefit pension plans using the recognition and disclosure provisions of gaap  which require the recognition of the funded status of retirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet 
we record  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci  actuarial gains or losses  prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that have not yet been recognized 
the determination of our obligation and expense for company sponsored pension plans and other post retirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts 
those assumptions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  average life expectancy and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs 
actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions  including the discount rate used and the expected return on plan assets  may materially affect our pension and other post retirement obligations and our future expense 
note to the consolidated financial statements discusses the effect of a change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other post retirement benefit costs and the related liability 
the objective of our discount rate assumptions was intended to reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled 
in making this determination  we take into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plans 
our policy for selecting the discount rates as of year end changed from the policy as of year end and in  our policy was to match the plan s cash flows to that of a hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flow from coupons and maturities match the plan s projected benefit cash flows 
the discount rates are the single rates that produce the same present value of cash flows 
the selection of the and discount rates as of year end for pension and other benefits  respectively  represents the hypothetical bond portfolio using bonds with an aa or better rating constructed with the assistance of an outside consultant 
in and  our policy was to match the plan s cash flows to that of a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zero coupon corporate bonds for each maturity 
benefit cash flows due in a particular year can theoretically be settled by investing them in the zero coupon bond that matures in the same year 
the discount rates are the single rates that produce the same present value of cash flows 
the selection of the and discount rates as of year end for pension and other benefits  respectively  represents the equivalent single rates constructed under a broad market aa yield curve constructed with the assistance of an outside consultant 
a basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the projected pension benefit obligation as of february   by approximately to determine the expected rate of return on pension plan assets  we consider current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted rates of return on various asset categories 
for and  we assumed a pension plan investment return rate of 
our pension plan s average rate of return was for the calendar years ended december   net of all investment management fees and expenses 
the value of all investments in our company sponsored defined benefit pension plans during the calendar year ending december   net of investment management fees and expenses  increased 
for the past years  our average annual rate of return has been 
the average annual return for the s p over the same period of time has been 
based on the above information and forward looking assumptions for investments made in a manner consistent with our target allocations  we believe an rate of return assumption is reasonable 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the asset allocations of pension plan assets 
sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions used in the calculation of kroger s pension plan liabilities for the qualified plans is illustrated below in millions 
percentage point change projected benefit obligation decrease increase expense decrease increase discount rate expected return on assets we contributed million in  million in and million in to our company sponsored defined benefit pension plans 
in february  we contributed million to the company sponsored defined benefit pension plans and do not expect to make any additional contributions in we expect contributions made during will decrease our required contributions in future years 
among other things  investment performance of plan assets  the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations  and future changes in legislation  will determine the amounts of contributions 
we contributed and expensed million in  million in  and million in to employee k retirement savings accounts 
the k retirement savings account plans provide to eligible employees both matching contributions and automatic contributions from the company based on participant contributions  plan compensation  and length of service 
multi employer pension plans we also contribute to various multi employer pension plans based on obligations arising from collective bargaining agreements 
these plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers 
the benefits are paid from assets held in trust for that purpose 
trustees are appointed in equal number by employers and unions 
the trustees typically are responsible for determining the level of benefits to be provided to participants as well as for such matters as the investment of the assets and the administration of the plans 
in the fourth quarter of  we entered into a memorandum of understanding mou with locals of the ufcw that participated in four multi employer pension funds 
the mou established a process that amended each of the collective bargaining agreements between kroger and the ufcw locals under which we made contributions to these funds and consolidated the four multi employer pension funds into one multi employer pension fund 
under the terms of the mou  the locals of the ufcw agreed to a future pension benefit formula through we are designated as the named fiduciary of the new consolidated pension plan with sole investment authority over the assets 
we committed to contribute sufficient funds to cover the actuarial cost of current accruals and to fund the pre consolidation unfunded actuarial accrued liability uaal that existed as of december   in a series of installments on or before march  at january   the uaal was estimated to be million pre tax 
in accordance with gaap  we expensed million in related to the uaal 
the expense was based on a preliminary estimate of the contractual commitment 
in  we finalized the uaal contractual commitment and recorded an adjustment that reduced our estimated commitment by million pre tax 
the final uaal contractual commitment  at january   was million pre tax 
in the fourth quarter of  we contributed million to the consolidated multi employer pension plan of which million was allocated to the uaal and million was allocated to service and interest costs and expensed in in the fourth quarter of  we contributed million to the consolidated multi employer pension plan to fully fund our uaal contractual commitment 
future contributions will be dependent  among other things  on the investment performance of assets in the plan 
the funding commitments under the mou replace the prior commitments under the four existing funds to pay an agreed upon amount per hour worked by eligible employees 
we recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded or  in the case of the ufcw consolidated pension plan  when commitments are made  in accordance with gaap 
we made cash contributions to these plans of million in  million in and million in the cash contributions for and include our million contribution in and our million contribution in to the ufcw consolidated pension plan in the fourth quarter of each year 
based on the most recent information available to us  we believe that the present value of actuarially accrued liabilities in most of these multi employer plans substantially exceeds the value of the assets held in trust to pay benefits 
we have attempted to estimate the amount by which these liabilities exceed the assets  ie  the amount of underfunding  as of december  because kroger is only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans  we also have attempted to estimate the ratio of kroger s contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year as a way of assessing kroger s share of the underfunding 
nonetheless  the underfunding is not a direct obligation or liability of kroger or of any employer except as noted above 
as of december   we estimate that kroger s share of the underfunding of multi employer plans to which kroger contributes was billion  pre tax  or billion  after tax 
this represents a decrease in the estimated amount of underfunding of approximately million  pre tax  or million  after tax  as of december   compared to december  the decrease in the amount of underfunding is attributable to our contribution to the ufcw consolidated pension plan in and the increased returns on the assets held in the multi employer plans during our estimate is based on the most current information available to us including actuarial evaluations and other data that include the estimates of others  and such information may be outdated or otherwise unreliable 
we have made and disclosed this estimate not because  except as noted above  this underfunding is a direct liability of kroger 
rather  we believe the underfunding is likely to have important consequences 
in  excluding all payments to the ufcw consolidated pension plan and the pension plans that were consolidated into the ufcw consolidated pension plan  our contributions to these plans increased approximately over the prior year and have grown at a compound annual rate of approximately since in  we expect to contribute approximately million to our multi employer pension plans  subject to collective bargaining and capital market conditions 
this amount reflects a contribution decrease  compared to  due to the ufcw consolidated pension plan 
excluding all payments to the ufcw consolidated pension plan and the pension plans that were consolidated into the ufcw consolidated pension plan  based on current market conditions  we expect increases in expense as a result of increases in multi employer pension plan contributions over the next few years 
finally  underfunding means that  in the event we were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these funds  we could trigger a substantial withdrawal liability 
any adjustment for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated  in accordance with gaap 
the amount of underfunding described above is an estimate and could change based on contract negotiations  returns on the assets held in the multi employer plans and benefit payments 
the amount could decline  and kroger s future expense would be favorably affected  if the values of the assets held in the trust significantly increase or if further changes occur through collective bargaining  trustee action or favorable legislation 
on the other hand  kroger s share of the underfunding could increase and kroger s future expense could be adversely affected if the asset values decline  if employers currently contributing to these funds cease participation or if changes occur through collective bargaining  trustee action or adverse legislation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information relating to our participation in these multi employer pension plans 
deferred rent we recognize rent holidays  including the time period during which we have access to the property for construction of buildings or improvements  as well as construction allowances and escalating rent provisions on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
the deferred amount is included in other current liabilities and other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
uncertain tax positions we review the tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns to determine whether and to what extent a benefit can be recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and other related disclosures related to uncertain tax positions 
various taxing authorities periodically audit our income tax returns 
these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions  including state and local taxes  we record allowances for probable exposures 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which an allowance has been established  is audited and fully resolved 
as of february   the internal revenue service had concluded its field examination of our and federal tax returns 
we have filed an administrative appeal within the internal revenue service protesting certain adjustments proposed by the internal revenue service as a result of their field work 
the assessment of our tax position relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions 
share based compensation expense we account for stock options under the fair value recognition provisions of gaap 
under this method  we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments granted 
we recognize share based compensation expense  net of an estimated forfeiture rate  over the requisite service period of the award 
in addition  we record expense for restricted stock awards in an amount equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date of the award  over the period the award restrictions lapse 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally on a lifo basis or market 
in total  approximately of inventories in and of inventories in were valued using the lifo method 
cost for the balance of the inventories was determined using the fifo method 
replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by billion at february   and by billion at january  we follow the link chain  dollar value lifo method for purposes of calculating our lifo charge or credit 
we follow the item cost method of accounting to determine inventory cost before the lifo adjustment for substantially all store inventories at our supermarket divisions 
this method involves counting each item in inventory  assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts of each item and recording the cost of items sold 
the item cost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory when compared to the retail method of accounting 
in addition  substantially all of our inventory consists of finished goods and is recorded at actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances and cash discounts 
we evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities 
we record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date 
vendor allowances we recognize all vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs when the related product is sold 
in most cases  vendor allowances are applied to the related product cost by item  and therefore reduce the carrying value of inventory by item 
when it is not practicable to allocate vendor allowances to the product by item  we recognize vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs based on inventory turns and as the product is sold 
we recognized approximately billion in  billion in  and billion in of vendor allowances as a reduction in merchandise costs 
we recognized approximately of all vendor allowances in the item cost with the remainder being based on inventory turns 
recently adopted accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended its rules regarding the presentation of comprehensive income 
the objective of this amendment is to improve the comparability  consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
specifically  this amendment requires that all non owner changes in shareholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the new rules became effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  in december  the fasb deferred certain aspects of this standard beyond the december  effective date  specifically the provisions dealing with reclassification adjustments 
we adopted these amended standards effective january  by presenting separate consolidated statements of comprehensive income immediately following the consolidated statements of operations 
in may  the fasb amended its rules for disclosure requirements for common fair value measurement 
these amendments  effective for the interim and annual periods beginning on or after december  early adoption was prohibited  result in a common definition of fair value and common requirements for fair value measurement and disclosure between gaap and international financial accounting standards 
consequently  the amendments change some fair value measurement principles and disclosure requirements 
the implementation of the amended accounting guidance did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
recently issued accounting standards as discussed above under recently adopted accounting standards  in december the fasb deferred certain provisions of its rule amendments dealing with reclassification adjustments 
in february  the fasb amended its standards on comprehensive income by requiring disclosure in the footnotes of information about amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
specifically  the amendment will require disclosure of the line items of net income in which the item was reclassified only if it is reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
it will also require cross reference to other disclosures for amounts that are not reclassified in their entirety in the same reporting period 
the new disclosures will be required for us prospectively only for annual periods beginning february  and interim periods within those annual periods 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow information net cash provided by operating activities we generated billion of cash from operations in  compared to billion in and billion in the cash provided by operating activities came from net earnings including non controlling interests adjusted primarily for non cash expenses of depreciation and amortization  the lifo charge and changes in working capital 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in  compared to  resulted primarily due to an increase in net earnings including non controlling interests  offset by a decline in long term liabilities and changes in working capital 
the decline in long term liabilities in is due to the investment returns of our company sponsored pension plans during the year and our funding of the remaining uaal commitment  partially offset by a lower discount rate on our company sponsored pension plans 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in  compared to  was primarily due to the decline in net earnings including non controlling interests  due to the ufcw consolidated pension plan charge  and changes in working capital  offset by an increase in long term liabilities 
the increase in long term liabilities in was due to establishing a liability for our remaining estimated commitment for the uaal in excess of the cash contribution and a lower discount rate on our company sponsored pension plans  offset by the investment returns of our company sponsored pension plans during the year 
changes in working capital also provided used cash from operating activities of million in  compared to million in and million in the decrease in cash provided by changes in working capital for  compared to  was primarily due to an increase in inventories and prepaid expenses  offset partially by an increase in accrued expenses 
prepaid expenses increased in  compared to  due to kroger prefunding million of employee benefits at the end of the decrease in cash provided by changes in working capital for  compared to  was primarily due to an increase in inventories  offset partially by increases in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses 
these amounts are also net of cash contributions to our company sponsored defined benefit pension plans totaling million in  million in and million in the amount of cash paid for income taxes increased in  compared to  primarily due to an increase in net earnings including non controlling interests 
the amount of cash paid for income taxes decreased in  compared to  primarily due to a decrease in net earnings including non controlling interests and from the bonus depreciation deductions allowed by the tax relief act for property placed into service in net cash used by investing activities cash used by investing activities was billion in  compared to billion in and billion in the amount of cash used by investing activities increased in  compared to  due to increased payments for capital investments and acquisitions 
the amount of cash used by investing activities decreased in  compared to  due to decreased payments for other investing activities  offset partially by increased payments for acquisitions 
capital investments  including changes in construction in progress payables and excluding acquisitions  were billion in  billion in and billion in refer to the capital investment section for an overview of our supermarket storing activity during the last three years 
net cash used by financing activities financing activities used million of cash in  compared to billion in and billion in the decrease in the amount of cash used for financing activities in  compared to  was primarily related to increased proceeds from the issuance of long term debt and net borrowings from our commercial paper program  offset partially by payments on long term debt 
the increase in the amount of cash used for financing activities in  compared to  was primarily related to increased payments for treasury stock purchases  partially offset by increased borrowings under our commercial paper program 
we repurchased billion of kroger common shares in  compared to billion in and million in we paid dividends totaling million in  million in and million in debt management total debt  including both the current and long term portions of capital leases and lease financing obligations increased million to billion as of year end  compared to the increase in  compared to  resulted from increased borrowings of billion of commercial paper supported by our credit facility and the issuance of i million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of and ii million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of  offset partially by payments at maturity of i million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of  ii million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of and iii million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 
this increase was primarily due to our million ufcw consolidated pension plan contribution in the fourth quarter of  prefunding million of employee benefit costs at the end of  our common share repurchase activity during the year  the payment at maturity of million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of and the purchase of a specialty pharmacy 
total debt increased million to billion as of year end  compared to year end the increase in  compared to  resulted from increased net borrowings of commercial paper of million and the issuance of million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of  offset by the payment at maturity of our million of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 
in  we expect to refinance billion of debt 
we plan on refinancing our debt maturities in along with an additional issuance of approximately million to replace the senior notes bearing an interest rate of that matured in the fourth quarter of the debt that matured in the fourth quarter of was previously refinanced with commercial paper 
we have entered into million notional amount of forward starting interest rate swaps to effectively hedge the changes in future benchmark interest rates on a portion of our expected issuances of fixed rate debt 
liquidity needs we estimate our liquidity needs over the next twelve month period to be approximately billion  which includes anticipated requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  interest payments and scheduled principal payments of debt and commercial paper  offset by cash and temporary cash investments on hand at the end of based on current operating trends  we believe that cash flows from operating activities and other sources of liquidity  including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility  will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future beyond the next twelve months 
we have approximately billion of commercial paper and billion of senior notes maturing in the next twelve months  which is included in the billion in estimated liquidity needs 
we expect to refinance this debt by issuing additional senior notes or commercial paper on favorable terms based on our past experience 
billion of this debt matures in the first quarter of in the first quarter of  we anticipate refinancing this billion through cash flows from operating activities and by issuing billion to billion of additional senior notes 
we also currently do not expect to repurchase our common shares at the levels we did in we used our commercial paper program toward the end of to fund our common share repurchases  a million pre tax pre funding of employee benefit costs at the end of  a million ufcw consolidated pension plan contribution in the fourth quarter of and the payment at maturity of of senior notes bearing an interest rate of 
we also expect our contributions to the ufcw consolidated pension plan to decrease in future periods 
we may use our commercial paper program to fund debt maturities at the end of but do not currently expect to use the program permanently 
we believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to maintain our current debt ratings and to respond effectively to competitive conditions 
factors affecting liquidity we can currently borrow on a daily basis approximately billion under our commercial paper cp program 
at february   we had billion of cp borrowings outstanding 
cp borrowings are backed by our credit facility  and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facility 
if our short term credit ratings fall  the ability to borrow under our current cp program could be adversely affected for a period of time and increase our interest cost on daily borrowings under our cp program 
this could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facility  under which we believe we have sufficient capacity 
however  in the event of a ratings decline  we do not anticipate that our borrowing capacity under our cp program would be any lower than million on a daily basis 
although our ability to borrow under the credit facility is not affected by our credit rating  the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facility could be affected by an increase in our leverage ratio 
as of march   we had billion of cp borrowings outstanding 
the decrease as of march   compared to year end  was due to applying cash from operations against our year end cp outstanding borrowings 
our credit facility requires the maintenance of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio our financial covenants 
a failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facility 
these financial covenants and ratios are described below our leverage ratio the ratio of net debt to consolidated ebitda  as defined in the credit facility was to as of february  if this ratio were to exceed to  we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired 
in addition  our applicable margin on borrowings is determined by our leverage ratio 
our fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of consolidated ebitda plus consolidated rental expense to consolidated cash interest expense plus consolidated rental expense  as defined in the credit facility was to as of february  if this ratio fell below to  we would be in default of our credit facility and our ability to borrow under the facility would be impaired 
consolidated ebitda  as defined in our credit facility  includes an adjustment for unusual gains and losses including our ufcw consolidated pension plan liability adjustment in our credit agreement is more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we were in compliance with our financial covenants at year end the tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments  based on year of maturity or settlement  as of february  in millions of dollars thereafter total contractual obligations long term debt interest on long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations low income housing obligations financed lease obligations self insurance liability construction commitments purchase obligations total other commercial commitments standby letters of credit surety bonds guarantees total the contractual obligations table excludes funding of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations  which totaled approximately million in this table also excludes contributions under various multi employer pension plans  which totaled million in  including our million contribution to the ufcw consolidated pension plan 
the liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing of future tax settlements cannot be determined 
as of february   we had billion of borrowings of commercial paper and no borrowings under our credit agreement and money market lines 
amounts include contractual interest payments using the interest rate as of february   and stated fixed and swapped interest rates  if applicable  for all other debt instruments 
the amounts included in the contractual obligations table for self insurance liability related to workers compensation claims have been stated on a present value basis 
our construction commitments include funds owed to third parties for projects currently under construction 
these amounts are reflected in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
our purchase obligations include commitments to be utilized in the normal course of business  such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our manufacturing plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and manufacturing facilities 
our obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties 
any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
as of february   we maintained a billion with the ability to increase by million  unsecured revolving credit facility that  unless extended  terminates on january  outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings  and some outstanding letters of credit  reduce funds available under the credit agreement 
in addition to the credit agreement  we maintained two uncommitted money market lines totaling million in the aggregate 
the money market lines allow us to borrow from banks at mutually agreed upon rates  usually at rates below the rates offered under the credit agreement 
as of february   we had billion of borrowings of commercial paper and no borrowings under our credit agreement and money market lines 
the outstanding letters of credit that reduce funds available under our credit agreement totaled million as of february  in addition to the available credit mentioned above  as of february   we had authorized for issuance million of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec and effective on december  on january   the board of directors authorized for issuance additional securities in the amount of billion over and above the million of securities available for issuance as of february  subsequent to year end  we filed a current report on form k  on february   incorporating by reference additional exhibits to the shelf registration statement including the board of directors resolution 
we also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our self insured workers compensation claims 
these bonds are required by most states in which we are self insured for workers compensation and are placed with predominately third party insurance providers to insure payment of our obligations in the event we are unable to meet our claim payment obligations up to our self insured retention levels 
these bonds do not represent liabilities of kroger  as we already have reserves on our books for the claims costs 
market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and  in some instances  availability of these bonds may become more limited  which could affect our costs of  or access to  such bonds 
although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly affect our ability to access these surety bonds  if this does become an issue  we would issue letters of credit  in states where allowed  against our credit facility to meet the state bonding requirements 
this could increase our cost and decrease the funds available under our credit facility 
we have guaranteed half of the indebtedness of two real estate entities in which we have a ownership interest 
our share of the responsibility for this indebtedness  should the entities be unable to meet their obligations  totals approximately million 
based on the covenants underlying this indebtedness as of february   we believe that it is unlikely that we will be responsible for repayment of these obligations 
we also are contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions 
we could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations 
due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties  and various other remedies available to us  we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote 
we have agreed to indemnify certain third party logistics operators for certain expenses  including pension trust fund contribution obligations and withdrawal liabilities 
in addition to the above  we enter into various indemnification agreements and take on indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business 
such arrangements include indemnities against third party claims arising out of agreements to provide services to kroger  indemnities related to the sale of our securities  indemnities of directors  officers and employees in connection with the performance of their work  and indemnities of individuals serving as fiduciaries on benefit plans 
while kroger s aggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability  we are not aware of any current matter that could result in a material liability 
outlook this discussion and analysis contains certain forward looking statements about kroger s future performance 
these statements are based on management s assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available 
such statements relate to  among other things projected changes in net earnings attributable to the kroger co  identical supermarket sales growth  expected product cost  expected pension plan contributions  our ability to generate operating cash flows  projected capital expenditures  square footage growth  opportunities to reduce costs  cash flow requirements  and our operating plan for the future  and are indicated by words such as comfortable  committed  will  expect  goal  should  intend  target  believe  anticipate  plan  and similar words or phrases 
these forward looking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially 
statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations  projections  beliefs  intentions or strategies are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of while we believe that the statements are accurate  uncertainties about the general economy  our labor relations  our ability to execute our plans on a timely basis and other uncertainties described below could cause actual results to differ materially 
we expect net earnings per diluted share in the range of for this equates to our long term growth rate of to from our adjusted fiscal net earnings per diluted share of  which excludes the ufcw consolidated pension accrual and credit card settlement adjustments in the third quarter of and the extra week in the fourth quarter of we expect the first quarter net earnings per diluted share growth rate for to be on the low end of the range primarily due to expected inflation being lower in the first quarter of  compared to  and the growth of our pharmacy business not being as substantial as in the first quarter of we expect the second and third quarters net earnings per diluted share growth rate for to be at the high end to above the range primarily due to expected inflation being more comparable in the second and third quarters of  compared to the second and third quarters of  and expecting our identical supermarket sales to be trending upwards 
we also expect the fourth quarter net earnings per diluted share growth rate for to be lower than the prior year on a week to week basis primarily due to a budgeted lifo charge of million compared to a lifo credit of million in the fourth quarter of we expect identical supermarket sales growth  excluding fuel sales  of in we expect identical supermarket sales growth to increase over time during relative to in  we experienced higher levels of inflation early in the year 
in the second half of the year  several branded prescription drugs came off patent  and when branded prescription drugs come off patent and are sold as generics  sales are reduced because generic equivalents have lower retail prices than branded drugs 
we do not expect these conditions to continue to have the same impact for our long term business model seeks to produce annual earnings per diluted share growth averaging  plus a dividend of to  for a total shareholder return of approximately 
for  we intend to continue to focus on improving sales growth  in accordance with our customer st strategy  by making investments in gross margin and customer shopping experiences 
we expect to finance these investments primarily with operating cost reductions 
we expect fifo non fuel operating margins for to expand slightly compared to  excluding the ufcw consolidated pension plan accrual and the credit card settlement adjustments in for  we expect our annualized lifo charge to be approximately million 
this forecast is based on estimated cost changes for products in our inventory 
for  we expect interest expense to be approximately million 
we plan to use cash flow primarily for capital investments  to maintain our current debt coverage ratios  to pay cash dividends  and to repurchase stock 
as market conditions change  we may re evaluate these uses of cash flow 
we expect to obtain sales growth from new square footage  as well as from increased productivity from existing locations 
capital investments reflect our strategy of growth through expansion  filling in targeted existing markets  entering a new market and focusing on productivity increases from our existing store base through remodels 
in addition  we intend to continue our emphasis on self development and ownership of real estate  and logistics and technology improvements 
our continued capital spending on technology is focused on improving store operations  logistics  manufacturing procurement  category management  merchandising and buying practices  and is expected to reduce merchandising costs 
we intend to continue using cash flow from operations to finance capital expenditure requirements 
we expect capital investments for to increase to the range of billion  excluding acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities 
we also expect capital investments to increase incrementally million over the next few years  excluding acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities  to accomplish our strategy 
we expect total food store square footage for to grow approximately before acquisitions and operational closings 
based on current operating trends  we believe that cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity  including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facility  will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  interest payments and scheduled principal payments for the foreseeable future 
we also believe we have adequate coverage under our debt covenants to continue to respond effectively to competitive conditions 
we believe we have adequate sources of cash  if needed  under our credit facility and other borrowing sources for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future beyond the next twelve months 
we expect that our og a results will be affected by increased costs  such as higher employee benefit costs and credit card fees  offset by improved productivity from process changes and leverage gained through sales increases 
we expect that our effective tax rate for will be approximately  excluding the effect of the resolution of any tax issues 
we expect rent expense  as a percentage of total sales and excluding closed store activity  will decrease due to the emphasis our current strategy places on ownership of real estate 
we believe that in there will be opportunities to reduce our operating costs in such areas as administration  productivity improvements  shrink  warehousing and transportation 
we intend to invest most of these savings in our core business to drive profitable sales growth and offer improved value and shopping experiences for our customers 
in february  we contributed million to the company sponsored defined benefit pension plans and do not expect to make any additional contributions in we expect contributions made during will decrease our required contributions in future years 
among other things  investment performance of plan assets  the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations  and future changes in legislation  will determine the amounts of additional contributions 
we expect expense for company sponsored defined benefit pension plans to be approximately million 
in addition  we expect k retirement savings account plan cash contributions and expense from automatic and matching contributions to participants to increase slightly in  compared to we expect to contribute approximately million to multi employer pension plans in  subject to collective bargaining 
in addition  excluding all payments to the ufcw consolidated pension plan and the pension plans that were consolidated into the ufcw consolidated pension plan  we expect increases in expense as a result of increases in multi employer pension plan contributions over the next few years 
we do not anticipate additional goodwill impairments in in  we expect to refinance billion of debt 
we plan on refinancing our debt maturities in along with an additional issuance of approximately million to replace the senior notes bearing an interest rate of that matured in the fourth quarter of the debt that matured in the fourth quarter of was previously refinanced with commercial paper 
we have various labor agreements that will be renegotiated in  covering store employees in indianapolis  dallas  houston  seattle and cincinnati  among others 
upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements  work stoppages by the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate new contracts with labor unions 
a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of locations could have a material adverse effect on our results 
in all of these contracts  rising health care and pension costs will continue to be an important issue in negotiations 
various uncertainties and other factors could cause us to fail to achieve our goals 
these include the extent to which our sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet our requirements may be affected by the state of the financial markets and the effect that such condition has on our ability to issue commercial paper at acceptable rates 
our ability to borrow under our committed lines of credit  including our bank credit facilities  could be impaired if one or more of our lenders under those lines is unwilling or unable to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us  or in the event that natural disasters or weather conditions interfere with the ability of our lenders to lend to us 
our ability to refinance maturing debt may be affected by the state of the financial markets 
changes in market conditions could affect our cash flow 
our ability to achieve sales and earnings goals may be affected by labor negotiations or disputes  changes in the types and numbers of businesses that compete with us  pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors  including non traditional competitors  and the aggressiveness of that competition  our response to these actions  the state of the economy  including interest rates  the inflationary and deflationary trends in certain commodities  and the unemployment rate  the effect that fuel costs have on consumer spending  changes in government funded benefit programs  manufacturing commodity costs  diesel fuel costs related to our logistics operations  trends in consumer spending  the extent to which our customers exercise caution in their purchasing in response to economic conditions  the inconsistent pace of the economic recovery  changes in inflation or deflation in product and operating costs  stock repurchases  the effect of brand prescription drugs going off patent  our ability to retain additional pharmacy sales from third party payors  and the success of our future growth plans 
the extent to which the adjustments we are making to our strategy create value for our shareholders will depend primarily on the reaction of our customers and our competitors to these adjustments  as well as operating conditions  including inflation or deflation  increased competitive activity  and cautious spending behavior of our customers 
our ability to achieve sales and earnings goals may also be affected by our ability to manage the factors identified above 
our product cost inflation could vary from our estimate due to general economic conditions  weather  availability of raw materials and ingredients in the products that we sell and their packaging  and other factors beyond our control 
our ability to pass on product cost increases will depend on the reactions of our customers and competitors to those increases 
our ability to use free cash flow to continue to maintain our debt coverage and to reward our shareholders could be affected by unanticipated increases in net total debt  our inability to generate free cash flow at the levels anticipated  and our failure to generate expected earnings 
during the first three quarters of the year  our lifo charge and the recognition of lifo expense will be affected primarily by estimated year end changes in product costs 
our lifo charge for the year will be affected primarily by changes in product costs at year end 
if actual results differ significantly from anticipated future results for certain reporting units including variable interest entities  an impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value would have to be recognized 
in addition to the factors identified above  our identical store sales growth could be affected by increases in kroger private label sales  the effect of our sister stores new stores opened in close proximity to an existing store and reductions in retail pricing 
our operating margins  without fuel  could decline or fail to meet expectations if we are unable to pass on any cost increases  if we fail to deliver the cost savings contemplated or if changes in the cost of our inventory and the timing of those changes differ from our expectations 
we have estimated our exposure to the claims and litigation arising in the normal course of business  as well as to the material litigation facing kroger  and believe we have made provisions where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable 
unexpected outcomes in these matters  however  could result in an adverse effect on our earnings 
changes in the types and numbers of businesses that compete with us are likely to continue and the effects on our business  either favorable or unfavorable  cannot be foreseen 
rent expense  which includes subtenant rental income  could be adversely affected by the state of the economy  increased store closure activity and future consolidation 
depreciation expense  which includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases  is computed principally using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of individual assets  or the remaining terms of leases 
use of the straight line method of depreciation creates a risk that future asset write offs or potential impairment charges related to store closings would be larger than if an accelerated method of depreciation were followed 
our effective tax rate may differ from the expected rate due to changes in laws  the status of pending items with various taxing authorities  and the deductibility of certain expenses 
the actual amount of automatic and matching cash contributions to our k retirement savings account plan will depend on the number of participants  savings rate  compensation as defined by the plan  and length of service of participants 
the amounts of our contributions and recorded expense related to multi employer pension funds could vary from the amounts that we expect  and could increase more than anticipated 
should asset values in these funds deteriorate  if employers withdraw from these funds without providing for their share of the liability  or should our estimates prove to be understated  our contributions could increase more rapidly than we have anticipated 
if the investment performance of our pension plan assets does not meet expectations due to poor performance of the financial markets or for other reasons  our contributions to company sponsored defined benefit pension plans could increase more than anticipated in future periods 
changes in laws or regulations  including changes in accounting standards  taxation requirements and environmental laws may have a material effect on our financial statements 
changes in the general business and economic conditions in our operating regions may affect the shopping habits of our customers  which could affect sales and earnings 
changes in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial indicators 
for example  we continue to add supermarket fuel centers to our store base 
since gasoline generates low profit margins  we expect to see our fifo gross profit margins decline as gasoline sales increase 
although this negatively affects our fifo gross margin  gasoline sales provide a positive effect on og a expense as a percentage of sales 
our capital expenditures  expected square footage growth  and number of store projects completed over the next fiscal year could differ from our estimate if we are unsuccessful in acquiring suitable sites for new stores  if development costs vary from those budgeted  if our logistics and technology or store projects are not completed on budget or within the time frame projected  or if economic conditions fail to improve  or worsen 
interest expense could be adversely affected by the interest rate environment  changes in our credit ratings  fluctuations in the amount of outstanding debt  decisions to incur prepayment penalties on the early redemption of debt and any factor that adversely affects our operations and results in an increase in debt 
impairment losses  including goodwill  could be affected by changes in our assumptions of future cash flows  market values or business valuations in the market 
our cash flow projections include several years of projected cash flows which would be affected by changes in the economic environment  real estate market values  competitive activity  inflation and customer behavior 
our estimated expense and obligation for kroger sponsored pension plans and other post retirement benefits could be affected by changes in the assumptions used in calculating those amounts 
these assumptions include  among others  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  average life expectancy and the rate of increases in compensation and health care costs 
adverse weather conditions could increase the cost our suppliers charge for their products  or may decrease customer demand for certain products 
increases in demand for certain commodities could also increase the cost our suppliers charge for their products 
additionally  increases in the cost of inputs  such as utility costs or raw material costs  could negatively affect financial ratios and earnings 
although we presently operate only in the united states  civil unrest in foreign countries in which our suppliers do business may affect the prices we are charged for imported goods 
if we are unable to pass on these increases to our customers  our fifo gross margin and net earnings would suffer 
earnings and sales also may be affected by natural disasters or adverse weather conditions  particularly to the extent that they disrupt our operations or those of our suppliers  create shortages in the availability or increases in the cost of products that we sell in our stores or materials and ingredients we use in our manufacturing facilities  or raise the cost of supplying energy to our various operations  including the cost of transportation 
we cannot fully foresee the effects of changes in economic conditions on kroger s business 
we have assumed economic and competitive situations will not change significantly in other factors and assumptions not identified above could also cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking information 
accordingly  actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in  contemplated or implied by forward looking statements made by us or our representatives 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial risk management we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and  to a lesser extent  adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
as a matter of policy  all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure 
because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure  fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure 
the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets 
we manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of variable and fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps 
our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates 
to do this  we use the following guidelines i use average daily outstanding borrowings to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure  ii limit the average annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of billion or less  iii include no leveraged products  and iv hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current mark to market status 
as of february   we maintained interest rate swap agreements  with notional amounts totaling million  to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates 
these agreements mature at varying times between april and december  and coincide with our scheduled debt maturities 
the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense 
these interest rate swap agreements are being accounted for as fair value hedges 
as of february   other long term assets totaling million were recorded to reflect the fair value of these agreements  primarily offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying debt 
as of february   we maintained forward starting interest rate swap agreements with maturity dates between april and january with an aggregate notional amount totaling million 
a forward starting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges the variability in future benchmark interest payments attributable to changes in interest rates on the forecasted issuance of fixed rate debt 
we entered into the forward starting interest rate swaps in order to lock in fixed interest rates on our forecasted issuances of debt in fiscal year the fixed interest rates for these forward starting interest rate swaps range from to 
the variable rate component of the forward starting interest rate swaps is month libor 
accordingly  the forward starting interest rate swaps were designated as cash flow hedges as defined by gaap 
as of february   the fair value of the interest rates swaps was recorded in other investments for million and accumulated other comprehensive income for million net of tax 
annually  we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines described above 
the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate 
the tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges and underlying debt portfolio as of february  and january  the amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of long term debt  excluding capital leases  and the average outstanding notional amounts of interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges as of february  and january  interest rates reflect the weighted average rate for the outstanding instruments 
the variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on us dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of february  and january  the fair value column includes the fair value of our debt instruments and interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges as of february  and january  refer to notes  and to the consolidated financial statements 
february  expected year of maturity thereafter total fair value in millions debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate february  average notional amounts outstanding thereafter february  total february  fair value in millions interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges fixed to variable average pay rate average receive rate january  expected year of maturity thereafter total fair value in millions debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate january  average notional amounts outstanding thereafter january  total january  fair value in millions interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges fixed to variable average pay rate average receive rate based on our year end variable rate debt levels  a percent change in interest rates would be immaterial 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies 
commodity price protection we enter into purchase commitments for various resources  including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores  warehouses  manufacturing facilities and administrative offices 
we enter into commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of normal business 
those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases
