item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with selected financial data and our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including but not limited to those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
background cpsi was founded in and specializes in delivering comprehensive healthcare information systems and related services to rural and community hospitals 
our systems and services are designed to support the primary functional areas of a hospital and to enhance access to necessary financial and clinical information 
our comprehensive system enables healthcare providers to improve clinical  financial and administrative processes and outcomes 
our products and services provide solutions in key areas  including patient management  financial management  patient care and clinical  enterprise and office automation 
in addition to servicing small to medium sized hospitals  we provide information technology services to other related entities in the healthcare industry  such as nursing homes  home health agencies and physician clinics 
we sell a fully integrated  enterprise wide financial and clinical hospital information system comprised of all necessary software  hardware  peripherals  forms and office supplies  together with comprehensive customer service and support 
we also offer business management services  including electronic billing submissions  patient statement processing and accounts receivable management  as part of our overall information system solution 
our system currently is installed and operating in over hospitals in states and the district of columbia 
our customers consist of rural and community hospitals with or fewer acute care beds  with hospitals having or fewer acute care beds comprising approximately of our customers 
management overview we primarily seek revenue growth through sales of healthcare information technology systems and related services to existing and new customers within our historic target market 
our strategy has produced consistent revenue growth over the long term  as reflected in five and ten year compounded annual growth rates in revenues of approximately and  respectively 
selling new and additional products and services to our existing customer base is an important part of cpsi s future revenue growth 
we believe that as our customer base grows  the demand for additional products and services  including business management services  will also continue to grow  supporting further increases in recurring revenues 
we also expect to drive revenue growth from new product development that we may generate from our research and development activities 
in january  we announced the formation of trubridge  llc trubridge  a wholly owned subsidiary of cpsi 
initially  trubridge will provide the business management  consulting and managed information technology services that have historically been provided by cpsi with the expectation of expanding both our service offerings and our footprint in this particular marketplace in the future 
we expect this strategic initiative to allow us to more fully take advantage of the market opportunities in providing such services by facilitating the expansion of our target market to include the entire rural and community hospital market  no longer limiting the market for our services to hospitals where cpsi already serves as the primary information technology vendor 
in addition to revenue growth  our business model is focused on earnings growth 
once a hospital has installed our system  we continue to provide support and maintenance services to our customers on an ongoing 
table of contents 
index to financial statements basis 
these services are typically provided by the same personnel who perform our system installations but at a reduced cost to us  and therefore at an increased gross margin 
we also look to increase margins through cost containment measures where appropriate 
as a result of the recent economic recession  continued economic uncertainty and tightened lending standards  hospitals have experienced reduced availability of third party credit and an overall reduction in their investment portfolios 
in addition  healthcare organizations with a large dependency on medicare and medicaid populations  such as community based hospitals  have been impacted by the challenging financial condition of the federal government and many state governments and government programs 
accordingly  we recognize that prospective hospital customers often do not have the necessary capital to make investments in information technology 
additionally  in response to these challenges  hospitals have become more selective regarding where they invest capital  resulting in a focus on strategic spending that generates a return on their investment 
despite the current economic environment  we believe healthcare information technology is often viewed as more strategic to hospitals than other possible purchases because the technology offers the possibility of a quick return on investment 
information technology also plays an important role in healthcare by improving safety and efficiency and reducing cost 
additionally  we believe most hospitals recognize that they must invest in healthcare information technology to meet current and future regulatory  compliance and government reimbursement requirements 
we have experienced an increase in customers seeking financing arrangements from us over the past five years for system installations as a result of ongoing economic conditions and tightened lending standards  resulting in the majority of our new system installation customers seeking financing arrangements during historically  we have made financing arrangements available to customers on a case by case basis depending upon various aspects of the proposed contract and customer attributes 
these financing arrangements include short term payment plans  longer term lease financing through us or third party financing companies  and software as a service saas arrangements 
we intend to continue to work with prospective customers to provide for financing arrangements to purchase our systems so long as such arrangements do not adversely affect our financial position or liquidity 
we believe that meeting the financial needs of community based hospitals while allowing for the profitable expansion of our footprint in this market will remain both an opportunity and a challenge for us in the foreseeable future 
despite the ongoing challenging economic conditions generally  including continued tightened lending standards  we have not experienced a decline in demand for our products and services and our collections of receivables remains consistent with historical trends 
american recovery and reinvestment act of while the ongoing challenging economic conditions and tightened lending standards have impacted and could continue to impact the community hospitals that comprise our target market  we believe that the american recovery and reinvestment act of the arra has increased and will continue to increase demand for healthcare information technology and will have a positive impact on our business prospects through the arra includes more than billion in funding to aid healthcare organizations in modernizing their operations through the acquisition and wide spread use of healthcare information technology 
included in the funding is approximately billion in incentives through medicare and medicaid reimbursement systems to encourage and assist healthcare providers in adopting and using electronic health records ehrs 
these incentive payments began in  but if an eligible healthcare provider does not begin to demonstrate meaningful use of ehrs by october   then reimbursement under medicare will begin to be reduced 
our hospital customers began receiving these incentive payments under the arra in as of march   approximately of our hospital customers had received payments for ehr adoption totaling more than million 
we have been focused on ensuring that we take the necessary steps to meet the needs of rural and community hospitals to help them gain access to the incentives made available under the arra 
primary among those steps was ensuring that our technology meets the arra s ehr certification requirements 
during  
table of contents 
index to financial statements both our hospital and medical practice ehr solutions were certified as a complete ehr by cchit 
receiving this certification for both our hospital and medical practice ehr products ensures that both hospitals and providers using our ehr systems can attain meaningful use of ehrs and qualify for certain ehr incentives 
according to data reported by the office of the national coordinator for health it  along with the center for medicare and medicaid services  as of october cpsi is second among all vendors in terms of successful hospital attestations for complete ehr systems 
as a result of our obtaining this certification and our track record with our hospital customers successfully achieving meaningful use  the arra has had and should continue to have a positive impact on our business and the businesses of the community hospitals that comprise our target market 
health care reform in march  president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of  collectively referred to as the health reform laws 
this sweeping legislation implements changes to the healthcare and health insurance industries from through  with the ultimate goal of requiring substantially all us citizens and legal residents to have qualifying health insurance coverage by and providing the means by which it will be made available to them 
we anticipate that the health reform laws will have little direct impact on our internal operation but may have a significant impact on the businesses of our hospital customers once fully in effect 
we have not been able to determine at this point whether the impact will be positive  negative or neutral  however  it is likely that the health reform laws will affect hospitals differently depending upon the populations they service 
rural and community hospitals typically service higher uninsured populations than larger urban hospitals and rely more heavily on medicare and medicaid for reimbursement 
it remains to be seen whether the increase in the insured populations for rural and community hospitals  as well as the increase in medicare and medicaid reimbursements under arra for hospitals that implement ehr technology  will be enough to offset proposed cuts in medicare and medicaid reimbursements contained in the health reform laws 
we believe healthcare initiatives will continue during the foreseeable future 
if adopted  some aspects of previously proposed reforms  such as further reductions in medicare and medicaid payments  could adversely affect the businesses of our customers and thereby harm our business 
deficit reduction sequestration president obama signed legislation on august   the budget control act of  to increase the us debt ceiling 
this legislation mandates significant cuts in federal spending over the next decade  as the special bipartisan congressional committee appointed under the legislation failed to take any action on deficit reduction 
although medicaid is specifically exempted from the federal spending cuts mandated by the legislation  it calls for a reduction of up to in federal medicare spending  all of which will be achieved by reduced reimbursements to healthcare providers 
with the passage of the american taxpayer relief act of  the reduced reimbursements provided for under the budget control act took effect starting in march as our hospital customers rely heavily on reimbursements from medicare to fund their operations  the anticipated reduction in reimbursement rates  although capped at  could negatively affect the businesses of our customers and our business 
financial overview our gross revenues increased  while our net income increased 
the disproportionate increase in net income versus gross revenues is due to a decrease in income tax expense as  during  we recognized significant provision to return adjustments related to prior years domestic production activities deduction dpad amounts 
despite the increase in net income  cash flow from operations decreased due primarily to significant increases in our financing receivables 
we continued to experience increased levels of customers seeking financing arrangements for system installations during the year due to continued challenging economic conditions and unavailability of third party credit 
additionally  as our new system installation customer base 
table of contents 
index to financial statements expects significant future cash inflows in the form of ehr incentive payments  we have experienced a significant demand for financing arrangements allowing new system installation customers to minimize the near term impact on their current cash resources 
as a result  we have experienced a significant increase in financing arrangements that allow customers to utilize anticipated cash inflows under the ehr incentive programs in satisfaction of their principal obligation in purchasing our ehr solution 
these customers have opted for payment terms that result in the full satisfaction of principal within a timeframe consistent with that of our historical financing arrangements 
we will continue to grant financing arrangements to customers on a case by case basis depending upon various aspects of the proposed contract and customer attributes 
despite the decrease in cash flow from operations during the year  we paid a special  one time dividend of approximately million per share during december in anticipation of a significant increase in tax rates on dividends beginning in this dividend  which was in addition to our standard quarterly dividend  was partially funded by the liquidation of million of our investment portfolio 
we have maintained a strong cash position that we believe is sufficient to meet our operating requirements 
we believe that a strong cash position enables us to compete better in the marketplace and maintain the quality of our customer service and product offerings 
at the beginning of  we began including language in certain of our customer license agreements that more evenly matches customers anticipated cash inflows under the ehr incentive program with the necessary cash outflows for purchasing our ehr solution extended meaningful use installment plans 
under these arrangements  customers are required to remit to us incentive payments not to exceed the remaining balance under the arrangement received for adoption of qualifying ehrs upon receipt of such funds  with only nominal payments required until the customer s receipt of such incentive payments 
if no such incentive payments are received by the customer or if such payments are not sufficient to pay the remaining balance under the arrangement  payments continue at contracted nominal amounts until the balance of the contract price is paid in full 
ehr incentive payments aside  these nominal payment amounts would result in the overall duration of the payment periods significantly exceeding that of our historical financing arrangements 
as a result  revenue from these arrangements is recognized as the amounts become due 
as of december   we have accumulated unrecognized revenue of million to be recognized as the amounts become due under these contracts 
of the customers contributing to the million in accumulated unrecognized revenue as of december   more than half have attested to stage one of meaningful use as of march   with each of those customers attesting to stage one having already received related medicaid incentive payments 
medicare payments  which are typically significantly larger than the related medicaid payments  are still pending for most of these customers 
our experience suggests an average time from successful attestation in stage one to receipt of funds from medicare under the ehr incentive program of approximately six weeks 
overall with respect to these contracts  we typically experience a timeframe of to months from the date of installation to receipt of funds under the ehr incentive program 
the final new system installation under an extended meaningful use installment plan was performed during the fourth quarter of  and the company does not expect to offer such payment terms going forward 
as a result  aside from the anticipated recognition of the million of accumulated unrecognized revenue as of december   we do not expect extended meaningful use installment plans to have a significant impact on our future financial statements 
although we do not expect to offer extended meaningful use installment plans going forward  we expect the trend towards increased financing arrangements to continue for the next few years 
however  the overall payment period durations of future financing arrangements are expected to be consistent with that of our historical financing arrangements  resulting in revenue from future financing arrangements being recognized upon installation of our ehr solution 
revenues the company allocates revenue to its multiple element arrangements  including software and software related services based on a hierarchy of evidence to support selling prices in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
revenue from general support agreements for post contract support services support and maintenance and information technology management and consulting services are recognized by the company ratably over the term of the agreement

support and maintenance 
the principal costs associated with our system support and maintenance services are employee salaries  benefits and certain other overhead expenses 
these costs are expensed as incurred 
our employees that perform system installations also provide support and maintenance services 
we allocate their time equally between the two functions to provide them with an equal amount of time at home providing support services versus travelling away from home performing system installations 
as such  salary related expenses are allocated between cost of system sales and cost of support and maintenance services based upon an estimate of the percentage of time employees spend performing each function 
we had software installation and support employees as of december  compared to as of december  supplies and forms represent an additional cost associated with our support and maintenance services 
these costs are expensed as incurred

costs of sales 
total costs of sales increased by  or million 
as a percentage of revenues  costs of sales increased slightly from to 
costs of systems sales increased  or million 
this increase is mostly attributable to increases in travel costs and payroll and related expenses 
travel costs increased  or million  as a result of the increased activity in new system installations 
payroll and related expenses increased  or million  due to moderate increases in the related headcount necessary to successfully accomplish the increased installation workload 
these increases were partially offset by a  or million  decrease in cost of equipment due largely to a decrease in equipment sales 
during  we experienced an unusually high number of equipment sales to existing customers and related cost of equipment due to the company s migration to a new operating platform  which required many customers to upgrade existing hardware to support the new platform 
the gross margin on system sales remained relatively flat  decreasing slightly from in to in this is despite the prevalence of extended meaningful use installment plans in the company s new system implementations  which comprised nearly one third of all new system installations for under these arrangements  the company recognizes all non equipment expenses as the installations occur but will not recognize the related revenue until the customers successfully achieve meaningful use designation and receive related arra incentive payments 
excluding the effects of the unrecognized revenue noted above and the deferral of the related cost of equipment  the adjusted gross margin on system sales as hereinafter defined in the non gaap financial measures section below increased to in the table below summarizes the major components of costs of system sales as a percentage of system sales revenues year ended december  payroll and related expenses travel expenses cost of equipment if the company had recognized the million of unrecognized revenue accumulated during from extended meaningful use installment plans  payroll and related expenses  travel expenses  and adjusted cost of equipment as hereinafter defined in the non gaap financial measures section below would represent   and  respectively  of adjusted system sales as hereinafter defined in the non gaap

cost of support and maintenance increased  or million  due entirely to an increase in payroll and related costs of  or million 
the increase in payroll and related costs was driven by the addition of personnel to provide it managed services  which was a new service offering beginning in the third quarter of the gross margin on support and maintenance decreased from in to in  as our it managed services offering has yet to achieve the economies of scale that currently benefit the remainder of our support and maintenance services mix

bad debt expense in was significantly higher than historical trends as several customers declared bankruptcy during the second quarter of and we increased reserves for specific customers with which we had experienced collection problems 
as a result of the foregoing factors  income before taxes remained unchanged at million during both and income taxes 
our effective income tax rate for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
the significant decrease in our effective income tax rate was primarily due to favorable provision to return adjustments related to differences between the dpad reported on the federal income tax returns and amounts previously estimated  as well as the estimated additional net federal tax benefit to be realized by the company upon amending federal income tax returns for all open years for revised dpad amounts 
the federal research and development tax credit expired effective december   but was retroactively extended for amounts incurred from january  through december   when the american taxpayer relief act of atra was signed into law in january as the atra was signed into law during the first quarter of  no tax benefit from these potential credits has been recorded for however  our effective tax rate for the first quarter of will include a tax benefit from federal research and development tax credits attributable to the entire fiscal year and the first quarter of excluding the impact of the federal research and development tax credits to be recorded during  we anticipate our effective income tax rate to be for the year ended december

cash provided by operating activities has been used primarily to fund the growth in our business and return cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends 
because of our cash position  our board of directors decided to begin paying a quarterly dividend in we declared and paid dividends in the aggregate amount of million in including a special  one time dividend of approximately million during december in anticipation of a significant increase in tax rates on dividends beginning in  million in and million in we believe that paying dividends is an effective way of providing an investment return to our stockholders and a beneficial use of our cash 
however  the declaration of dividends by cpsi is subject to the discretion of our board of directors 
our board of directors will continue to take into account such matters as general business conditions  our financial results and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the slight decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in is despite a increase in net income from to  due primarily to significant increases in our financing receivables 
we continued to experience increased levels of customers seeking financing arrangements for system installations during the year due to continued challenging economic conditions  unavailability of third party credit  and the increasing preference by our new system installation customers to minimize the near term impact that purchasing our system will have on their current cash resources 
we expect this trend of increased levels of customers seeking financing arrangements for system installations to continue during the next twelve months  resulting in further increases in our financing receivables

we currently do not have a bank line of credit or other credit facility in place 
because we have no debt  we are not subject to contractual restrictions or other influences on our operations  such as payment demands and restrictions on the use of operating funds that are typically associated with debt 
if we borrow money in the future  we will likely be subject to operating and financial covenants that could limit our ability to operate as profitably as we have in the past 
defaults under applicable loan agreements could result in the demand by lenders for immediate payment of substantial funds and substantial restrictions on expenditures  among other things 
due to the recent economic recession and ongoing tightened lending standards  additional capital  if needed  may not be available on terms favorable to the company  or at all 
non gaap financial measures we have included in the discussion under the caption compared to above financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with gaap 
any analysis of non gaap financial measures should be made only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap 
below  we define each of these non gaap financial measures  provide a reconciliation of each non gaap financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap  and discuss the reasons that we believe this information is useful to management and may be useful to investors 
we use the non gaap financial measures adjusted gross margin on system sales  adjusted cost of equipment  and adjusted system sales 
management believes these non gaap financial measures provide our board of directors  investors  potential investors  securities analysts and others with useful information to evaluate our performance because they exclude the impact of unrecognized revenue  recognized revenue and related deferral of cost of equipment resulting from our use of extended meaningful use installment plans 
extended meaningful use installment plans were new to the company in  resulting in the company not having sufficient experience with comparable arrangements to establish evidence of a standard business practice of historically collecting under the original payment terms of such contracts without making concessions 
as a result  the provisions of the software topic and revenue recognition subtopic of the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification result in a conclusion that the fee is not fixed or determinable and  as a result  the revenue is to be recognized as the amounts become due 
because the timing of our recognition of revenue under extended meaningful use installment plans is not related to any remaining obligation on the part of the company  the company and our board of directors use these non gaap financial measures to evaluate our performance relative to other periods 
we believe that the most directly comparable gaap measures to adjusted gross margin on system sales  adjusted cost of equipment  and adjusted system sales

index to financial statements to multiple element arrangements in the revenue recognition topic and multiple element arrangments subtopic of the codification 
these standards require that four basic criteria must be met before revenues can be recognized persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
the recognition of revenue pursuant to these criteria involves estimates and judgments regarding the allocation of total arrangement consideration to the various elements of our multiple element arrangements  including  for certain elements  estimates and judgments regarding vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value  which we base on either the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management having the relevant authority to do so  for an element not yet sold separately 
vsoe calculations are updated and reviewed regularly depending on the nature of the product or service 
we base vsoe for the related undelivered elements on either renewals or stand alone sales as appropriate 
our determination that total fees for our products and services are fixed or determinable  which we base on signed contracts and orders 
our assessment that collection of amounts due is reasonably assured  which we base on our standard payment terms and collection history 
risks associated with these estimates and judgments and the effects thereof include if vsoe of fair value of any undelivered element does not exist  all revenue is deferred until vsoe of fair value of the undelivered element is established or the element has been delivered and if the fees are not fixed or determinable  or if collection is not reasonably assured  then the revenue recognized in various periods will be less than amounts that would have been otherwise recognizable using the residual method provided under the codification 
see note to the financial statements for further discussion of our revenue recognition policies 
although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments regarding revenue recognition is reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in revenue that could be material 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
trade accounts receivable are stated at the amount the company expects to collect and do not bear interest 
the collectability of trade receivable balances is regularly evaluated based on a combination of factors such as customer credit worthiness  past transaction history with the customer  current economic industry trends and changes in customer payment patterns  resulting in the establishment of general reserves 
additionally  if it is determined that a customer will be unable to fully meet its financial obligation  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or other material events impacting its business  a specific reserve for bad debt is recorded to reduce the related receivable to the amount expected to be recovered 
although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments regarding our allowance for doubtful accounts is reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in required reserves that could be material 
allowance for credit losses 
the company leases its information and patient care systems to certain healthcare providers under sales type leases 
the company establishes an allowance for credit losses for these financing receivables based on the historical level of customer defaults under such financing arrangements 
additionally  if it is determined that a customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or other material event impacting its business  a specific reserve is recorded to reduce the related receivable to the amount expected to be recovered 
reference is made to note to the financial statements for further information about our financing receivables 
although we believe that that our approach to estimates and judgments regarding our allowance for credit losses is reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in required reserves that could be material

index to financial statements estimates 
the company uses estimates to record certain transactions and liabilities 
these estimates are generally based on management s best judgment  past experience  and utilization of third party services such as actuarial and other expert services 
because these estimates are subjective and variable  actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
significant estimates included in our financial statements include those for self insurance reserves under our health insurance plan  reserves for uncertain tax positions  bad debt and credit allowances  legal liability exposure or lack thereof  and accrued expenses 
backlog backlog consists of revenues we reasonably expect to recognize over the next twelve months under existing contracts 
the revenues to be recognized may relate to a combination of one time fees for system sales  and recurring fees for support  business management  saas and isp services 
as of december   we had a twelve month backlog of approximately million in connection with non recurring system purchases and approximately million in connection with recurring payments under support  business management and saas contracts 
the backlog amounts exclude amounts to be recognized in subsequent periods related to extended meaningful use installment plans 
our backlog increase is the result of new contracts signed in to be installed in  as well as an increase in our customer base for recurring business 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market and interest rate risk our exposure to market risk relates primarily to the potential change in the value of our investment portfolio as a result of fluctuations in interest rates 
the primary purpose of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk of loss 
as of december   our investment portfolio consisted of a variety of financial instruments  including  but not limited to  money market securities and high quality government and corporate obligations 
it is our intent to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
we do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
the securities in our investment portfolio are classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on our balance sheet as a current asset at fair market value with their unrealized gain or loss reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
we believe that the market risk arising from our holdings of these financial instruments is minimal 
due to the conservative allocation of our investment portfolio  we do not believe that an immediate increase in interest rates would have a material effect on the market value of our portfolio 
since we have the ability to liquidate this portfolio  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage the interest rate risks associated with our investments
