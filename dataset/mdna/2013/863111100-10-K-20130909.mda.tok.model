raw materials commodity prices our primary raw materials are high grade zinc  brass  nickel silver  aluminum  steel and plastic resins 
these materials are generally available from a number of suppliers  but we have chosen to concentrate our sourcing with one primary vendor for each commodity or purchased component 
we believe our sources of raw materials are reliable and adequate for our needs 
however  the development of future sourcing issues related to using existing or alternative raw materials and the global availability of these materials as well as significant fluctuations in the market prices of these materials may have an adverse effect on our financial results if the increased raw material costs cannot be recovered from our customers 
given the significant financial impact on us relating to changes in the cost of our primary raw materials  commencing with fiscal  we began quoting quarterly material price adjustments for changes in our zinc costs in our negotiations with our customers 
our success in obtaining these quarterly price adjustments in our customer contracts is dependent on separate negotiations with each customer 
it is not a standard practice for our customers to include such price adjustments in their contracts 
we have been successful in obtaining quarterly price adjustments in some of our customer contracts 
however  we have not been successful in obtaining the adjustments with all of our customers
