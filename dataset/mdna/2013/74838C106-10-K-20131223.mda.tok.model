item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the md a contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under risk factors within item a 
overview we began operations in as a california company making boardshorts for surfers in the united states under a license agreement with the quiksilver brand founders in australia 
we reincorporated in delaware and went public in and  in subsequent years  acquired the worldwide licenses and trademarks that created the global company that we are today 
our business is rooted in the strong heritage and authenticity of our core brands  quiksilver  roxy and dc  each of which caters to the casual  outdoor lifestyle associated with surfing  skateboarding  snowboarding  bmx and motocross  among other activities 
today  our products are sold in over countries through a wide range of distribution points  including wholesale accounts surf shops  skate shops  snow shops  sporting goods stores  discount centers  specialty stores and select department stores  owned or licensed company retail stores  and via our e commerce websites 
we operate in the outdoor market of the sporting goods industry in which we design  develop and distribute branded apparel  footwear  accessories and related products 
we have four operating segments consisting of the americas  emea and apac  each of which sells a full range of our products  as well as corporate operations 
our americas segment includes revenues primarily from the united states  canada  brazil and mexico 
our emea segment includes revenues primarily from continential europe  the united kingdom  russia and south africa 
our apac segment includes revenues primarily from australia  japan  new zealand  south korea  taiwan and indonesia 
royalties earned from various licensees in other international territories are categorized in corporate operations along with revenues from sourcing services for our licensees 

table of contents multi year profit improvement plan in may  we announced a multi year profit improvement plan  or pip  designed to accelerate our three fundamental strategies of strengthening brands  growing sales and driving operational efficiencies 
the pip s initiatives focus on prioritizing our three core brands  globalizing key functions and reducing our cost structure 
important elements of the pip include clarifying the positioning of our three flagship brands quiksilver  roxy and dc  divesting or exiting certain non core brands  globalizing product design and merchandising  licensing of secondary or peripheral product categories  reprioritization of marketing investments to emphasize in store and print marketing along with digital and social media  continued investment in emerging markets and e commerce  improving sales execution  optimizing our supply chain  reducing product styles  centralizing global responsibility for key functions  including product design  supply chain  marketing  retail stores  licensing and administrative functions  and closing underperforming retail stores  reorganizing wholesale sales operations  implementing greater pricing disciplines  and improving product segmentation 
we expect that the pip  when fully implemented by the end of fiscal  will improve adjusted ebitda by approximately million compared with fiscal results 
of this increase  approximately is expected to come from supply chain optimization and the rest is expected to be primarily comprised of corporate overhead reductions  licensing opportunities and improved pricing management  along with modest net revenue growth 
we believe we have made meaningful progress on our pip during the second half of fiscal discontinued operations one of the elements of our multi year profit improvement plan involves divesting or exiting certain non core businesses in order to improve our focus on our three flagship brands 
in november  we completed the sale of mervin manufacturing  inc  a manufacturer of snowboards and related products under the lib technologies and gnu brands  mervin for million  subject to a final working capital adjustment 
additionally  we are in active negotiations to sell hawk designs  inc  our subsidiary that owns and operates our hawk brand  hawk and our majority stake in uk based surfdome shop  ltd  a multi brand e commerce retailer  surfdome

fiscal compared to fiscal revenues  net revenues  net by segment the following table presents consolidated net revenues from continuing operations in millions by segment in historical currency for each of fiscal and americas emea apac corporate total fiscal fiscal decrease our net revenues for fiscal were billion  a decrease of million or from billion in fiscal the million decrease in net revenues in fiscal was driven by a high single digit percentage decrease in net revenues across all three regional segments with americas segment revenues down million  emea segment revenues down million and apac segment revenues down million 
the decline in net revenues in our apac segment in fiscal was almost entirely due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates between fiscal and fiscal absent changes in foreign currency exchange rates  apac net revenues decreased by less than million in fiscal a more detailed discussion of net revenue changes by segment  brand and channel as adjusted for changes in foreign currency exchange rates ie  in constant currency is set forth below 
we use constant currency measurements to better understand actual growth rates in our foreign operations 
constant currency measurements remove the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations from period to period 
constant currency is calculated by taking the ending foreign currency exchange rate for balance sheet items or the average foreign currency exchange rate for income statement items used in translation for the current period and applying that same rate to the prior period 
the following table presents consolidated net revenues from continuing operations in millions by segment in constant currency for each of fiscal and americas emea apac corporate total fiscal fiscal decrease in constant currency  net revenues in the americas segment decreased versus the prior year due to a low double digit percentage decline in dc brand net revenues and a high single digit percentage decline

table of contents the increased level of clearance sales in our wholesale channel and the higher level of discounting in our retail channel were driven by our decision to liquidate aged inventory in fiscal  particularly in the fourth quarter 
the level of aged inventory was attributable to the revenue shortfall in emea versus our internal plans  retail store inventory rebalancing in the americas  and slower inventory sell through than we anticipated for earlier seasons 
the clearance sales within our wholesale channel were at lower margins than in fiscal as of october   aged inventory was approximately of total inventory  which was generally consistent with historical levels as of fiscal year end

financial position  capital resources and liquidity the following table shows our cash  working capital and total indebtedness at october  and october change in millions cash and cash equivalents working capital total indebtedness we believe that our cash flows from operations  together with our existing credit facilities and cash on hand will be adequate to fund our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
see debt structure below for a description of the various debt agreements comprising our total indebtedness 
operating cash flows we generated cash of million from operating activities of continuing operations in fiscal compared to cash used of million in fiscal the million change was the result of an million increase in operating cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities  partially offset by a million decrease in net income from operations before non cash charges in fiscal compared to fiscal 
table of contents working capital trade accounts receivable and inventories two of the primary components of our working capital and near term sources of cash at any point in time are trade accounts receivable and inventories 
a comparison of the balances of these items as of october  and is as follows october change in millions trade accounts receivable average days sales outstanding inventories inventory days on hand computed as net accounts receivable as of the balance sheet date  excluding value added taxes  divided by the result obtained by dividing fiscal and fiscal fourth quarter net wholesale revenues by days 
computed as net inventory as of the balance sheet date divided by the result obtained by dividing fiscal and fiscal fourth quarter cost of goods sold by days 
days sales outstanding dso was flat in the americas and increased in both apac and emea 
the increase in dso was driven by the timing of customer payments at year end and longer credit terms granted to certain wholesale customers 
total net inventory increased million as of october  compared to october  and inventory days on hand increased by days year over year primarily due to the increased clearance sales that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal capital expenditures capital expenditures were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal these investments include company owned stores and ongoing investments in computer and warehouse equipment  including a new erp system

asu provides guidance on the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits  reflecting the manner in which an entity would settle  at the reporting date  any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position when net operating loss carryforwards  similar tax losses  or tax credit carryforwards exist 
this accounting standard will be effective for us beginning november   with early adoption permitted 
we plan to early adopt this guidance effective november   and we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued asu  reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
asu requires presentation  either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes  of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive 
table of contents income by component and by net income line item 
this new guidance is effective on a prospective basis for us on november  as this guidance only impacts the presentation and disclosure of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  the adoption will not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
to prepare these financial statements  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
these estimates also affect our reported revenues and expenses 
judgments must also be made about the disclosure of contingent liabilities 
actual results could be significantly different from these estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses the accounting policies that are necessary to understand and evaluate our reported financial results 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when the risk of ownership and title passes to our customers 
generally  we extend credit to our customers and do not require collateral 
our sales agreements with our customers do not provide for any rights of return 
however  we do approve returns on a case by case basis at our sole discretion to protect our brands and our image 
we provide allowances for estimated returns when revenues are recorded  and related losses have historically been within our expectations 
accounts receivable throughout the year  we perform credit evaluations of our customers  and we adjust credit limits based on payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness 
we continuously monitor our collections and maintain a reserve for estimated credit losses based on our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
we also use insurance on certain classes of receivables in our emea segment 
historically  our losses have been consistent with our estimates  but there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have experienced in the past 
it is not uncommon for some of our customers to have financial difficulties from time to time 
this is normal given the wide variety of our account base  which includes small surf shops  medium sized retail chains  and some large department store chains 
inventories we value inventories at the cost to purchase and or manufacture the product or the current estimated market value of the inventory  whichever is lower 
we regularly review our inventory quantities on hand  and adjust inventory values for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated forecasts of product demand and market value 
long lived assets we acquire tangible and intangible assets in the normal course of our business 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of these long lived assets including fixed assets  trademarks  licenses and other amortizable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
impairments are recognized in operating earnings 
we use our best judgment based on the most current facts and circumstances regarding our business when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment tests  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments  and the fair value of a potentially impaired asset 
changes in assumptions used could have a significant impact on our assessment of recoverability 
goodwill we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at least annually based on a two step impairment test 
the first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
we have three reporting units under which we evaluate goodwill for impairment  the americas  emea and apac 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of a discounted cash flow approach and market approach 
material assumptions in our test for impairment include future cash flows of each reporting unit  discount rates applied to these cash flows and current market estimates of 
table of contents value 
the discount rates used approximate our cost of capital 
future cash flows assume varying degrees of future growth in each reporting unit s business 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value under the first step of our goodwill impairment test  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
as of october   the fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values 
goodwill amounted to million for the americas  million for emea and million for apac as of october  income taxes current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year 
a deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences of temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the value of our deferred tax assets 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized  we would reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value by recording a valuation allowance  thereby decreasing net income 
evaluating the value of these assets is necessarily based on our judgment 
if we subsequently determine that the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance had been recorded would  in our judgment  be realized in the future  the valuation allowance would be reduced  thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made 
on november   we adopted the authoritative guidance included in asc  income taxes which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements 
this guidance provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the tax position 
we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of our provision for income taxes 
the application of this guidance can create significant variability in our tax rate from period to period based upon changes in or adjustments to our uncertain tax positions 
stock based compensation expense we recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest using the graded vested method over the requisite service period of the award 
for option valuation  we determine the fair value at the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model which requires the input of certain assumptions  including the expected life of the stock based payment awards  stock price volatility and interest rates 
for performance based equity awards with stock price contingencies  we determine the fair value using a monte carlo simulation  which creates a normal distribution of future stock prices  which is then used to value the awards based on their individual terms 
foreign currency translation a significant portion of our revenues are generated in europe  where we operate with the euro as our primary functional currency  and a smaller portion of our revenues are generated in apac  where we operate with the australian dollar and japanese yen as our primary functional currencies 
our european revenues in the united kingdom are denominated in british pounds  and substantial portions of our emea and apac product is sourced in us dollars  both of which result in exposure to gains and losses that could occur from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
revenues and expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the average exchange rate for the period 
assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange on the balance sheet date 
gains and losses from assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity on which they reside are generally recognized currently in our statement of operations 
gains and losses from translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements into us dollars are included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
as part of our overall strategy to manage our level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts generally in the form of forward contracts 
for all contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges  we record the changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts in other comprehensive income or loss 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks 
two of these risks are foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changes in interest rates that affect interest expense 
see also note of our consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency and derivatives we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to certain sales  royalty income and product purchases of our international subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies 
we are also exposed to foreign currency gains and losses resulting from domestic transactions that are not denominated in us dollars  and to fluctuations in interest rates related to our variable rate debt 
furthermore  we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from the effect that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on the reported results in our consolidated financial statements due to the translation of the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries 
we use foreign currency exchange contracts and intercompany loans as part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
on the date we enter into a derivative contract  we designate the derivative as a hedge of the identified exposure 
before entering into various hedge transactions  we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as the risk management objective and strategy 
in this documentation  we identify the asset  liability  firm commitment  or forecasted transaction that has been designated as a hedged item and indicate how the hedging instrument is expected to hedge the risks related to the hedged item 
we formally measure effectiveness of our hedging relationships both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis in accordance with our risk management policy 
we will discontinue hedge accounting prospectively if we determine that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item  when the derivative expires or is sold  terminated or exercised  if it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction being hedged by the derivative will not occur  if a hedged firm commitment no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment  or if we determine that designation of the derivative as a hedge instrument is no longer appropriate 
derivatives that do not qualify or are no longer deemed effective to qualify for hedge accounting but are used by management to mitigate exposure to currency risks are marked to fair value with corresponding gains or losses recorded in earnings 
for all qualifying cash flow hedges  the changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income 
as of october   we were hedging a portion of forecasted transactions expected to occur through april assuming exchange rates at october  remain constant  million of losses  net of tax  related to hedges of these transactions are expected to be reclassified into earnings over the next eighteen months 
we enter into forward exchange and other derivative contracts with major banks and are exposed to foreign currency losses in the event of nonperformance by these banks 
we anticipate  however  that these banks will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts 
accordingly  we do not obtain collateral or other security to support the contracts 
translation of results of international subsidiaries as discussed above  we are exposed to financial statement gains and losses as a result of translating the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries 
we translate the local currency statements of operations of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars using the average exchange rate during the reporting period 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results and distort comparisons from period to period 
we generally do not use foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge the profit and loss effects of such exposure as accounting rules do not allow such types of contracts to qualify for hedge accounting 

table of contents by way of example  when the us dollar strengthens compared to the euro  there is a negative effect on our reported results for emea because it takes more profits in euros to generate the same amount of profits in stronger us dollars 
the opposite is also true 
that is  when the us dollar weakens there is a positive effect on the translation of our reported results from emea 
in addition  the statements of operations of apac are translated from australian dollars and japanese yen into us dollars  and there is a negative effect on our reported results for apac when the us dollar is stronger in comparison to the australian dollar or japanese yen 
emea revenues decreased in euros during fiscal compared to fiscal as measured in us dollars and reported in our consolidated statements of operations  emea revenues decreased as a result of a stronger euro versus the us dollar in comparison to the prior year 
apac revenues remained flat in australian dollars during fiscal compared to fiscal as measured in us dollars and reported in our consolidated statements of operations  apac revenues decreased as a result of a weaker australian dollar and japanese yen versus the us dollar in comparison to the prior year 
interest rates a limited amount of our outstanding debt bears interest based on libor  tibor or euribor plus a credit spread 
our effective interest rates  therefore  will move up or down depending on market conditions 
the credit spreads are subject to change based on financial performance and market conditions 
interest expense also includes financing fees and related costs and can be affected by foreign currency exchange rate movements upon translating non us dollar denominated interest expense into us dollars for reporting purposes 
the approximate amount of our variable rate debt was million at october   and the weighted average effective interest rate at that time was 
if interest rates or credit spreads were to increase by ie  to approximately  our annual income before tax would be reduced by approximately million based on the borrowing levels at the end of fiscal
