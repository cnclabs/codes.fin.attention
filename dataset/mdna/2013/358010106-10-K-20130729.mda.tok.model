item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
during fiscal years and  many of the company s development resources were applied to certain cost plus fee contracts and the design stage of fixed price satellite payload programs 
as a result  some of the company s development efforts were customer funded and the costs appear in cost of revenues resulting in reduced internal research and development spending 
for fiscal year  the company is targeting to spend between million and million on internal research and development projects 
the actual amount spent in fiscal year will depend on market conditions and identification of new opportunities 
patents and licenses the company believes that its business is generally not dependent on patent or license protection 
rather  it is primarily dependent upon the company technical competence  the quality of its products and its prompt and responsible contract performance 
however  employees working for the company assign all rights to inventions to the company and the company presently holds such patents and licenses 
in certain limited circumstances  the us government may use or permit the use by the company s competitors of certain patents or licenses the government has funded 
during fiscal year  the company received a broad and significant patent for new  proprietary quartz oscillator technology which the company intends to exploit in both legacy and new applications 
in  the company obtained a basic patent for its low g sensitivity technology which management believes will permit greatly enhanced performance of devices on moving platforms and under externally imposed shock or vibration 

table of contents competition the company experiences competition in all areas of its business

other sections of this form k include additional factors that could materially and adversely impact the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  the company operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict the impact of all these factors on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
given these risks and uncertainties  investors should not rely on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results 
any or all of the forward looking statements contained in this form k and any other public statement made by the company or its management may turn out to be incorrect 
the company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes its most critical accounting policies to be the recognition of revenue and costs on production contracts and the valuation of inventory 
each of these areas requires the company to make use of reasonable estimates including estimating the cost to complete a contract  the realizable value of its inventory or the market value of its products 
changes in estimates can have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 

table of contents revenue recognition revenues under larger  long term contracts which generally require billings based on achievement of milestones rather than delivery of product  are reported in operating results using the percentage of completion method 
on fixed price contracts  which are typical for commercial and us government satellite programs and other long term us government projects  and which require initial design and development of the product  revenue is recognized on the cost to cost method 
under this method  revenue is recorded based upon the ratio that incurred costs bear to total estimated contract costs with related cost of sales recorded as the costs are incurred 
each month management reviews estimated contract costs through a process of aggregating actual costs incurred and estimating additional costs to completion based upon the current available information and status of the contract 
the effect of any change in the estimated gross margin percentage for a contract is reflected in revenues in the period in which the change is known 
provisions for anticipated losses on contracts are made in the period in which they become determinable 
on production type orders  revenue is recorded as units are delivered with the related cost of sales recognized on each shipment based upon a percentage of estimated final program costs 
changes in job performance on long term contracts and production type orders may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined to be required 
provisions for anticipated losses on customer orders are made in the period in which they become determinable 
for customer orders in the company s gillam fei and fei zyfer segments or smaller contracts or orders in the fei ny segment  sales of products and services to customers are reported in operating results based upon i shipment of the product or ii performance of the services pursuant to terms of the customer order 
when payment is contingent upon customer acceptance of the installed system  revenue is deferred until such acceptance is received and installation completed 
costs and expenses contract costs include all direct material  direct labor costs  manufacturing overhead and other direct costs related to contract performance 
selling  general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
inventory in accordance with industry practice  inventoried costs contain amounts relating to contracts and programs with long production cycles  a portion of which will not be realized within one year 
inventory write downs are established for slow moving materials  obsolete items and costs incurred on programs for which production level orders cannot be determined as probable 
such write downs are based upon management s experience and expectations for future business 
any changes arising from revised expectations are reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
marketable securities all of the company s investments in marketable securities are level securities which trade on public markets and have current prices that are readily available 
in general  investments in fixed price securities are only in the commercial paper of financially sound corporations or the bonds of us government agencies 
although the value of such investments may fluctuate significantly based on economic factors  the company s own financial strength enables it to wait for the securities to either recover their value or to mature such that any interim unrealized gains or losses are deemed to be temporary 

table of contents impact of fei elcom acquisition fiscal year results include the results of operations of the company s subsidiary  fei elcom tech  inc formerly elcom technologies  inc or elcom and after the acquisition  fei elcom  which was acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal year fei elcom s operations are included in the fei ny segment 
for the year ended april   fei elcom s third party revenues were approximately million and this subsidiary recorded an operating loss of approximately  in the comparable twelve month period of the prior fiscal year  including the periods before and after the acquisition  elcom recorded revenues of approximately million  an operating loss of approximately  and a net loss of approximately  in the discussion below  all amounts for the year ended april   include fei elcom only for the two and one half months from the date of acquisition through the end of the fiscal year  with the exception of the company s other income expenses which includes a  gain on its elcom investment  a  equity loss from the company s minority interest in elcom through the date of acquisition and a  impairment charge against the company s investment in elcom and certain notes receivable from elcom

table of contents fiscal year compared to fiscal year for the year ended april   fei ny revenues from commercial and us government satellite programs increased over the prior year 
revenues from these programs accounted for of fiscal year consolidated sales  approximately the same ratio as for fiscal year revenues on these long term contracts are recognized primarily under the percentage of completion method 
for the year ended april   sales from the non space us government dod business area accounted for more than of consolidated revenues and increased by more than over fiscal year this increase is due to the impact of fei elcom which was acquired by the company in late fiscal year and is part of the fei ny segment 
for the year ended april   total revenues from both satellite and non space programs for which the us government is the end user  accounted for approximately of consolidated revenues compared to approximately in the prior fiscal year 
such revenues are recorded in the fei zyfer segment as well as fei ny including fei elcom 
for the year ended april   network infrastructure sales  which are recorded in all three segments  accounted for approximately of consolidated revenues as compared to approximately of revenues in the prior fiscal year 
network infrastructure sales were lower in fiscal year compared to fiscal year and is the partial cause of decreased revenue at the fei zyfer and gillam fei segments 
the decline in revenues at the gillam fei segment is also partially attributable to a year over year decrease in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and the euro 
the revenue decline at fei zyfer is also due to delays in orders from us government customers as a result of recent us budget issues 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year the increase in consolidated revenues in fiscal year over the prior year is primarily due to satellite payload revenues generated by the fei ny segment 
for the year ended april   revenues from commercial and us government satellite programs accounted for approximately half of consolidated revenues compared to approximately of revenues during fiscal year revenues on these long term contracts are recognized primarily under the percentage of completion method 
fiscal year revenues from fei elcom  after the acquisition  were less than million and are included in the fei ny segment s revenues 
increased network infrastructure revenues generated by the fei zyfer segment were offset by declines in that business area in the gillam fei segment and lower wireless infrastructure sales in the fei ny segment 
network infrastructure revenues were less than of consolidated revenues for the year ended april  compared to approximately for fiscal year in fiscal year  revenues from the non space us government dod business area  which are recorded in the fei ny and fei zyfer segments  were approximately of consolidated revenues compared to for fiscal year fiscal year revenues were lower due to completion of certain long term programs and delays in new program awards 
based on the company s current backlog  over three fourths of which represent satellite payload business  and the potential for additional new orders  fiscal year revenues are expected to grow 
satellite payload revenues will remain the dominant portion of the company s business and represent the company s best opportunity for long term growth  benefiting from both commercial and us government programs 
fiscal year revenues from the other major business areas  us government dod non space and network infrastructure  are expected to remain in approximately the same range as realized in fiscal year gross margin fiscal years ended april  in thousands change gm rate 
table of contents for each of the years ended april  and  gross margin increased as a result of increased revenues 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year gross margin was reduced by million of consolidated revenues as a result of the write down of certain inventory recorded in the gillam fei segment due to lack of certainty regarding the realizability of such inventory 
based on slower than anticipated rollout of implementation of the french government s plans to initiate a smart grid  the company has less visibility regarding the probable schedule for obtaining production level orders which are now anticipated to occur no earlier than fiscal year improved gross margins from satellite payload revenues in the fei ny segment were offset by historically lower gross margins at fei elcom 
gross margin rates in the fei zyfer and gillam fei segments were also lower on reduced sales 
for fiscal year  the gross margin rate improved over the rate recorded in the prior fiscal year 
the largest gross margin rate improvement during fiscal year occurred in the company s fei ny segment as a higher volume of business covered more of that segment s fixed costs 
during the fiscal year ended april   cost of sales included approximately million of inventory write downs  including the gillam fei inventory write down 
during fiscal year  cost of sales included increases to warranty reserves and inventory write downs which aggregated approximately million 
these charges reduced gross margin rates by in fiscal year and by in fiscal year fiscal year gross margin was also reduced by the fourth quarter acquisition of fei elcom whose operating results are included in the fei ny segment 
with the current mix of programs and orders in its backlog  the company expects its gross margin rate to approach its target rate of 
as revenues increase in future periods  the company expects to realize a higher gross margin as more of its fixed costs are covered 
selling and administrative expenses fiscal years ended april  in thousands change in the fiscal years ended april  and  selling and administrative costs were and  respectively  of consolidated revenues 
fiscal year expenses include a full year of selling and administrative expenses incurred by fei elcom 
for the years ended april  and  selling and administrative expenses include stock compensation expense of  and  respectively 
fiscal year expenses also include approximately  of transaction costs related to the fei elcom acquisition as well as approximately  related to a stock award to the company s employees in celebration of its th anniversary 
the company expects fiscal year selling and administrative expenses to be incurred at approximately the same rate relative to revenues 
research and development expenses fiscal years ended april  in thousands change research and development r d expenditures represent investments intended to keep the company s products at the leading edge of time and frequency technology and enhance competitiveness for future revenues 
r d spending for the year ended april  was approximately of revenues compared to approximately of revenues for fiscal year approximately half of the increased r d spending in fiscal year was due to product development expenditures at recently acquired fei elcom on its own product line 
additionally  the fei ny segment  including engineering resources at fei elcom  accelerated development of new satellite payload microwave receivers converters from dc to ka band  development and improvement of miniaturized rubidium atomic clocks  development of new gps based synchronization products and further enhancement of the capabilities of its line of low g sensitivity and ruggedized rubidium oscillators 
the lower rate and lower r d expenditures in fiscal year were due primarily to the dedication of resources to customer funded programs rather than to internal r d programs 
some customer funded development activity continued into fiscal year but with the added resources from fei elcom  the company spent more on internal r d 
the costs of customer funded development efforts appear in cost of revenues  thus reducing the level of internal r d spending 
although funding is obtained from customers  the company retains the rights to any products developed 
the company will continue to devote significant resources to develop new products  enhance existing products and implement efficient manufacturing processes 
for fiscal year  the company anticipates that internal research and development spending will be less than of revenues 
the company believes that internally generated cash and cash reserves are adequate to fund these development efforts 

table of contents operating profit fiscal years ended april  in thousands change for the year ended april   operating profit was reduced by the million inventory write down in the gillam fei segment  higher selling and administrative costs and increased r d spending 
all of the fiscal year operating profit was generated by the fei ny segment which enjoyed the benefit of rising satellite payload revenues 
the company s other segments  fei zyfer and gillam fei  both incurred operating losses on reduced revenues  higher costs and the inventory write down 
for the year ended april   higher revenues  improved gross margin rates and operating expenses in line with expectations enabled the company to record an operating profit that was nearly twice the operating profit recorded in the preceding fiscal year 
on a segment basis  the operating profit of fei ny increased as a result of a increase in revenues and improved gross margin rates 
the fiscal year operating profit at gillam fei was favorably impacted by an improved product mix despite lower revenues than for fiscal year fei zyfer realized an operating loss due to lower gross margins partially due to increased warranty reserves as well as product mix 
on anticipated increased revenues and favorable product mix  the company expects to realize an improved gross margin while maintaining other operating expenses within their targeted amounts 
thus  the company expects to report higher operating profits in fiscal year other income expense fiscal years ended april  in thousands change investment income gain on investment in affiliate nm equity loss nm impairment charge nm interest expense other expense  net investment income includes interest and dividend income on marketable securities 
earnings on these securities may vary based on fluctuating dividends and interest rates and the timing of purchases or sales of securities

during fiscal year  the company anticipates that investment income will be approximately the same as that earned in fiscal year  depending on the yield of its investment portfolio

table of contents in fiscal years and  interest expense was incurred on borrowings under short term credit obligations  on deferred compensation payments and capital leases for equipment 
during the year ended april   to complete the acquisition of fei elcom  the company decided to draw on its bank line of credit rather than liquidate any of its investment in marketable securities 
in addition  subsequent to april   the company established a five year  million credit facility with a bank  replacing the previous million credit line 
as a result of the new credit facility  the company expects to maintain a higher level of debt and anticipates that interest expense in fiscal year will be higher than that incurred in fiscal year other expenses for the year ended april   consists primarily of an uninsured loss sustained by the company s gillam fei segment 
for the year ended april   other expenses consisted primarily of amortization of certain non operating assets that was partially offset by gains of approximately  derived from the excess of proceeds over the cash values of life insurance policies covering a former employee 
the company anticipates that in future years items in this category will not be significant to pretax earnings

the changes reduced the company s effective tax rate on pre tax income to 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company reduced its valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in the amount of million 
this reduction was based on a review of all available evidence  both positive and negative  and management s assessment that it is more likely than not that it will be able to realize the tax benefits from the future deductibility of most items included in its deferred tax assets 
excluding the valuation allowance reduction  for the year ended april   the company recorded a net tax provision of million or an effective tax rate of 
the company is subject to taxation in several countries 
the statutory federal rates are in the us  in europe and in china
