item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview the aviation and aerospace industries as well as markets for the company s consumer products continually face evolving challenges on a global basis 
the operations of the company can be affected by the trends of the economy  including interest rates  income tax laws  government regulation  legislation  and other factors 
in addition  uncertainties in today s global economy  competition from expanding manufacturing capabilities and technical sophistication of low cost developing countries and emerging markets  currency policies in relation to the us dollar of some major foreign exporting countries  the effect of terrorism  difficulty in predicting defense and other government appropriations under expected administrative budget cuts  the vitality of the commercial aviation industry and its ability to purchase new aircraft  the willingness and ability of the company s customers to fund long term purchase programs  volatile market demand and the continued market acceptance of the company s advanced technology and cutlery products make it difficult to predict the impact on future financial results 
both the atg and cpg markets are sensitive to domestic and foreign economic conditions and policies  which may create volatility in operating results from period to period 
for example  the airline industry is sensitive to fuel price increases and economic conditions 
these factors directly impact the demand for aircraft production as well as the amount of repair and overhaul required on in service aircraft 
government procurements are subject to congressional appropriations and priorities that may change from year to year 
such changes could result in  but are not limited thereto  the expansion and or contraction of government procurement requirements  a reduction in funding  the continuation or termination of existing programs  the introduction of new programs requiring the funds that were originally directed to current programs  a stretch out in government delivery requirements or such other us government determinations that could result in increases or reductions of government purchase orders for the atg and or the cpg products 
the company s suppliers are also subject to all the pressures and volatility being generated by the current global economic conditions 
any interruption of the company s continuous flow of material and product parts that are required for the manufacture of the company s products could adversely impact the company s ability to meet the company s customers delivery requirements 
consistent with the evolving requirements of the aerospace industry  companies are increasingly being requested to operate under long term agreements with their customers on the basis of fixed prices  on the basis of targeted year to year price reductions and or on the basis of year to year price adjustments predicated on mutually agreed indices and or a combination of some or all of the above described pricing arrangements and or otherwise 
therefore  productivity improvements and cost containment strategies are continuously sought within the company s concept of continuous improvement 
the company s products are labor intensive and as such productivity improvements are expected to have positive effects on the company s operating results 
however  increased costs for raw material  purchased parts and or labor will have the reverse effect 
therefore  there are strong incentives to continuously improve productivity and to contain reduce costs 
if any adverse economic events reduce the number of airliners and or aircraft being produced by the company s relevant prime contractors  the negative effects of that reduction will in turn flow down through the supply chain 
also  certain major manufacturers have successfully imposed extended payment terms to their suppliers 
at times  these extended terms of payment are not available to the company when purchasing raw material such as aluminum  magnetic material  steel  etc 
and or other product support items and services 
if the company s customers delay their payments until after the extended due date or fail to pay  it could adversely impact the company s operating results 
the company s ability to manufacture products on a timely basis also depends on the company s suppliers on time delivery of raw material  sub components  machined parts and other necessary product support supplies 
interruptions of this flow of purchased materials could adversely affect the company s operations 
maximizing the company s operations requires continued dedicated performances from the company s key and other personnel 
in the company s markets and business arenas there is substantial competition for the services of the highest performing individuals 
competitors  customers and other companies who may have interest in the company s most experienced and educated highly trained personnel ie  managerial  engineering and accounting administrative are a continuing consequence of the company s history of successful operational performance 
any unplanned replacement of such personnel may require the hiring of new personnel on an expedited basis provided they are available and may temporarily interrupt the company s operations and efforts for continuous improvement 
in  the company made significant changes within the cpg as discussed on page of this k under the heading discontinued operations 
the company expects these changes product line eliminations to have a positive future impact on the company s profitability but remains cautiously optimistic for the future within the constraints of today s global economic environment 
management discussion during the years ended december  and  approximately and  respectively  of the company s revenues from continuing operations were derived from contracts with agencies of the us government or their prime contractors and their subcontractors 
sales of products sold for government applications decreased when comparing the results of to  due to decreased government shipments at the consumer products group in the amount of approximately  respectively  while shipments to the government at the advanced technology group remained relatively consistent 
the company believes that government involvement in military operations overseas will continue to have an impact on the financial results in both the advanced technology and consumer products markets 
while the company is optimistic in relation to these potential opportunities  it recognizes that sales to the government are affected by defense budgets  the foreign policies of the us and other nations  the level of military operations and other factors and  as such  it is difficult to predict the impact on future financial results 
the company s commercial business is affected by such factors as uncertainties in today s global economy  global competition  the vitality and ability of the commercial aviation industry to purchase new aircraft  the effects of terrorism and the threat of terrorism  market demand and acceptance both for the company s products and its customers products which incorporate company made components 
the atg continues its aggressive business development efforts in its primary markets and is broadening its activities to include new domestic and foreign markets that are consistent with its core competencies 
although the atg backlog continues to be strong  actual scheduled shipments may be delayed changed as a function of the company s customers final delivery determinations that may be based on changes in the global economy and other factors 
the company s cpg develops new commercial products and products for government and military applications 
included in the significant uncertainties in the near and long term is the impact of expected budgets cuts for military spending and vagaries inherent in the government procurement process and programs 
the atg and cpg continue to respond to us government procurement requests for quotes 
new product development activities are ongoing along with the acquisition and development of new product lines
