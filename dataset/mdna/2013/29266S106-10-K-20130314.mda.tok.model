item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors including the risks we discuss in item a of part i  risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview our business our corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility is located in irvine  california 
we develop  manufacture  market  and sell innovative medical devices for the treatment of aortic disorders 
our principal product is a stent graft and delivery catheter for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms aaa through minimally invasive endovascular repair 
we sell our products through i our direct us and european sales forces and ii third party distributors in europe  asia  latin america  and in other parts of the world 
see item  business  for a discussion of market overview and opportunity our products manufacturing and supply marketing and sales competition clinical trials and product developments overview was an important year of revenue growth  business expansion  and infrastructure development 
we continued to gain market share in the us  while also building our direct sales operations in europe 
combined with good results in other international markets  we achieved annual revenue growth 
we also made substantial progress with our new product pipeline  positioning us for several product launches in characteristics of our revenue and expenses revenue revenue is derived from sales of our elg system including extensions and accessories to hospitals upon completion of an evar procedure  or from sales to distributors upon title transfer which is typically at shipment  provided our other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold includes compensation including stock based compensation and benefits of production personnel and production support personnel

general and administrative expenses also include bad debt expense  patent and legal fees  financial audit fees  insurance  recruiting fees  other professional services  and allocated facilities related expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
while management believes these estimates are reasonable and consistent  they are by their very nature  estimates of amounts that will depend on future events 
accordingly  actual results could differ from these estimates 
our audit committee of the board of directors periodically reviews our significant accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies arise in conjunction with the following revenue recognition and accounts receivable inventory lower of cost or market goodwill and intangible assets impairment analysis income taxes stock based compensation contingent consideration for business acquisition litigation accruals revenue recognition and accounts receivable we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met we have appropriate evidence of a binding arrangement with our customer  the sales price for our elg system including extensions and accessories is established with our customer  our elg system has been used by the hospital in an evar procedure  or our distributor has assumed title with no right of return  as applicable  and collection from our customer is reasonably assured at the time of sale 
for sales made to a direct customer ie  hospitals  we recognize revenue upon completion of an evar procedure  when our elg device is implanted in a patient 
for sales to distributors  we recognize revenue at the time of title transfer  which is typically at shipment 
we do not offer any right of return to our customers  other than honoring our standard warranty 
in the event that we enter into a bill and hold arrangement with our customer  which is uncommon for us  though occurred in as discussed in note to accompanying consolidated financial statements  the following conditions must be met for revenue recognition i the risks of ownership must have passed to our customer  ii the customer must have made a fixed and written commitment to purchase the elg systems  iii the customer must request that the transaction be on a bill and hold basis  iv there must be a fixed schedule for delivery of the elg systems 
the date for delivery must be reasonable and must be consistent with the customer business purpose  v we have no remaining specific performance obligations and our earnings process is complete  vi our customer ordered elg systems must be segregated from our inventory and cannot be used to fulfill other customer orders  and vii the elg systems must be complete and ready for shipment 
in addition to the above requirements  we also consider other pertinent factors prior to our recognition of revenue for bill and hold arrangements  such as i the date by which we expect payment  and whether we have modified our normal billing and credit terms for the customer  ii our past experiences with  and pattern of  bill and hold transactions  iii whether the customer has the expected risk of loss in the event of a decline in the market value of the elg systems  iv whether our custodial risks are insurable and insured  and v whether extended procedures are necessary in order to assure that there are no exceptions to the customer commitment to accept and pay for the elg systems ie  that the business reasons for the bill and hold have not introduced a contingency to the customer commitment 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay amounts due 
these estimates are based on our review of the aging of customer balances  correspondence with the customer  and the customer payment history 
inventory lower of cost or market we adjust our inventory value for estimated amounts of obsolete or unmarketable items 
such assumptions involve projections of future customer demand  as driven by economic and market conditions  and the product shelf life 
if actual demand  or economic or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill and intangible assets impairment analysis goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not subject to amortization  but are tested for impairment annually as of june  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
we evaluate the possible impairment i if when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable  or ii in the case of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  our annual impairment assessment date of june income taxes our consolidated balance sheets reflect net deferred tax assets that primarily represent the tax benefit of net operating loss carryforwards and credits and timing differences between book and tax recognition of certain revenue and expense items  net of a valuation allowance 
when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized  we establish a valuation allowance for the amount that may not be realized 
each quarter  we evaluate the need to retain all or a portion of the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
our evaluation considers historical earnings  estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
adjustments to the valuation allowance increase or decrease net income or loss in the period such adjustments are made 
if our estimates require adjustments  it could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets in the future 
management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense for employees over the equity award vesting period  based on its fair value at the date of grant 
for awards granted to consultants  the award is marked to market each reporting period  with a corresponding adjustment to stock based compensation expense 
the fair value of equity awards that are expected to vest is amortized on a straight line basis over i the requisite service period or ii the period from grant date to the expected date of the completion of the performance condition for vesting of the award 
stock based compensation expense recognized is net of an estimated forfeiture rate  which is updated as appropriate 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to value stock option grants 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected volatility of our common stock  expected risk free interest rate  and the option expected life 
a portion of restricted stock vesting is dependent on us achieving certain regulatory and financial milestones 
we use significant judgment in estimating the likelihood and timing of achieving these milestones 
each period  we will reassess the likelihood and estimate the timing of reaching these milestones  and will adjust expense accordingly 
contingent consideration for business acquisition we determine the fair value of contingently issuable common stock related to the nellix acquisition using a probability based income approach using an appropriate discount rate 
changes in the fair value of the contingently issuable common stock are determined each period end and recorded in the other income expense section of the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss and the non current liabilities section of the consolidated balance sheet 
litigation accruals from time to time we are involved in various claims and legal proceedings of a nature considered normal and incidental to our business 
these matters may include product liability  intellectual property  employment  and other general claims 
we accrue for contingent liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the accruals are adjusted periodically as assessments change or as additional information becomes available

row sales growth is attributable to the july launch of afx in brazil and argentina  and intuitrak orders by our distributor in japan in anticipation of its japanese regulatory approval  which was received in december 
cost of goods sold  gross profit  and gross margin percentage year ended december  variance percent change in thousands cost of goods sold gross profit gross margin percentage gross profit as a percent of revenue the million increase in cost of goods sold was driven by our revenue increase of million 
gross margin for the year ended december  decreased to from for the twelve months ended december  this decrease is primarily due to i a greater proportion of the total revenue being derived from international sales in which have an average sales price below the us sales price  ii royalty expenses which were not present for the full prior year period  and iii a decline in the average value of the euro relative to the us dollar in from these unfavorable gross margin items were partially offset by a greater proportion of our current period revenue derived from direct sales  as opposed to distributor sales  which typically have a higher average sales price 
operating expenses year ended december  variance percent change in thousands research and development clinical and regulatory affairs marketing and sales general and administrative contract termination and business acquisition expenses settlement costs research and development 
the million decrease in research and development expenses was primarily driven by decreasing ventana development activities  as this device reaches the final stages of development and progresses towards production and commercialization 
this decrease was partially offset by a million purchase in the current period of an exclusive license to patents covering the polymer used in our nellix system 
clinical and regulatory affairs 
the million increase in clinical affairs was primarily driven by the continued enrollment and follow up costs associated with our pevar and ventana clinical trials and our efforts to achieve ce mark approval of ventana and the nellix system 
marketing and sales 
the million increase in marketing and sales expenses was primarily related to marketing costs to support the growth of our us business  costs related to our direct sales force in europe which was largely not present in the prior year period  and an increase in variable compensation expense of million  driven by an increase in us revenue of 
general and administrative 
the million increase in general and administrative expenses is attributable to i additional personnel to support our business growth  ii increased travel expenses associated with the expansion of our european operations  and iii professional service fees to develop our global legal structure 
contract termination and business acquisition expenses 
current period expense of million is associated with professional fees incurred as part of the july acquisition of our italian distributor business 
in the prior year period we early terminated a distribution agreement with two former european distributors for aggregate termination fees of million 
these actions allowed us to begin selling our products through our direct sales force in most of western europe  beginning september   and in italy  beginning july  settlement costs 
settlement costs of million in the current period represents our payment in full to settle a patent dispute with cook incorporated 
provision for income taxes year ended december  variance in thousands income tax expense benefit for the twelve months ended december   our provision for income taxes was million and our effective tax rate was for the year ended december  during the twelve months ended december   we had operating legal entities in the us  italy  and the netherlands plus registered sales branches of our dutch entity in certain countries in europe 
we had a single operating legal entity in the us during the prior year period until september  when we formed operating legal entities in the netherlands to begin direct sales activity in europe 
accordingly  we have certain minimum tax liabilities attributable to our operations in these countries in that were not present in year ended december  versus december  revenue year ended december  variance percent change in thousands revenue our revenue increase primarily resulted from an increase in us sales due to i the expansion of our sales force  ii the successful market introduction of additional elg device sizes and extensions beginning in the second half of  and iii the successful launch of afx in august though our overall revenue growth was driven by us sales  it was partially offset by our decrease in european sales 
from january  through august  and all prior periods  our european sales were solely derived from independent distributors 
from september  through december   our european sales were derived from i our developing direct european sales force serving the markets of austria  belgium  the czech republic  denmark  france  germany  luxemburg  the netherlands  romania  sweden  switzerland  and the united kingdom excluding northern ireland  and ii four independent distributors serving the markets in italy  greece  turkey  and ireland

the million increase in research and development expenses was primarily driven by development activities related to the nellix system  which represented an increase of million of total research and development expenses for the year ended december  the remaining increase in research and development  as compared to  is related to services and materials for general research and development activities for our other projects  including ventana 
clinical and regulatory affairs 
the million increase in clinical affairs expenses was primarily driven by the continued enrollment and follow up costs associated with our pevar clinical trial 
marketing and sales 
the million increase in marketing and sales expenses for the twelve months ended december  as compared to was primarily related to additional sales personnel related costs 
we experienced an increase in variable compensation expense associated with our increase in us revenue for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the prior year 
we also had an increase in marketing costs associated with driving us sales growth  and incurred million of incremental expenses in to build our direct sales force in europe 
general and administrative 
the million increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily related to an increase of i million in legal costs associated with patent disputes  ii million in consulting and professional services  iii million in bank fees  iv million increase in various costs to enhance our information technology infrastructure  and v million increase in additional personnel costs  including recruitment and relocation expenses to support our us and european business growth 
these increases were partially offset by million of nellix acquisition costs that only arose in the prior year 
contract termination and business acquisition expenses 
upon mutual agreement  we terminated a european distribution agreement  effective september  in connection therewith  we were contractually required to pay this distributor million in order to start directly marketing and selling our products within certain western european countries 
additionally  upon mutual agreement  we early terminated a distribution agreement with an italian distributor  effective march  we were contractually required to pay this distributor million as part of the transfer of distribution rights to another italian distributor

c total current assets at period end divided by total current liabilities at period end 
operating activities cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   as compared to cash used in operating activities of million in the prior year period 
the decrease in cash used in operating activities is primarily a function of particularly large inventory expenditures in the prior year period to prepare for our august launch of afx  partially offset by a general increase in expenditures to support our expanding world wide operations 
during the twelve months ended december  and  our cash collections from customers totaled million and million  respectively  representing and of reported revenue for the same periods 
investing activities cash used in investing activities for the twelve months ended december  was million and consisted of i machinery and equipment purchases for the production of our elg systems  ii expenditures for various information technology enhancements  and iii the acquisition of our former italian distributor business 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities was million for the twelve months ended december   as compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in the prior year period 
the million of cash provided by financing activities was attributable to our i million of net proceeds from the june equity raise discussed below  ii proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options  and iii proceeds of million from our sale of stock through our employee stock purchase plan 
june equity raise on may   we executed a common stock purchase agreement the stock purchase agreement with piper jaffray co 
piper 
pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase agreement piper purchased million shares of our common stock at per share on june   and subsequently executed an option to purchase an additional million shares at the purchase price of per share  which closed on june  these two transactions resulted in net proceeds to us of million the june equity raise 
we plan to use these proceeds to support our continued growth  which may include sales and marketing expenditures  research and development activities  clinical trials  business expenditures  and administrative and infrastructure investments 
credit arrangements in october  we entered into a revolving credit facility with wells fargo bank wells  which was last amended on october   whereby we may borrow up to million  subject to the calculation and limitation of a borrowing base the wells credit facility 
all amounts owing under the wells credit facility will become due and payable upon its expiration on march  as of december   we did not have any outstanding borrowings under the wells credit facility 
any outstanding amounts under the wells credit facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to the wells prime rate  plus  which is payable on a monthly basis 
the wells credit facility is collateralized by all of our assets  except our intellectual property 
the wells credit facility contains financial covenants requiring us to i maintain a minimum current ratio of  equal to the quotient of modified current assets to current liabilities  as defined in the wells credit facility the current ratio covenant  and ii not exceed operating loss amounts excluding non cash contingent consideration associated with the acquisition of nellix of million for the quarter ended march   million for the six months ended june   million for the nine months ended september   and million for the year ended december  the operating loss covenant 
the wells credit facility carried a unused commitment fee through may   when this fee was eliminated 
the wells credit facility also included a negative covenant limiting capital expenditures to an aggregate million 
we were not in compliance with the operating loss covenant for the nine months ended september   and for the year ended december  we obtained a waiver from wells for such breaches of the operating loss covenant on october  and february   respectively  whereby wells agreed to forbear from enforcing their default rights under the wells credit facility 
the waiver does not apply to any subsequent breaches of the same provision  nor any breach of any other provision specified within the wells credit facility 
the wells credit facility also contains a material adverse change clause mac 
if we encounter difficulties that would qualify as a mac in its i operations  ii condition financial or otherwise  or iii ability to repay amounts outstanding under the wells credit facility  it could be canceled at wells sole discretion 
wells could then elect to declare the indebtedness  together with accrued interest and other fees  to be immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing such indebtedness 
in advance of the march  expiration of the wells credit facility  we are presently in process of discussing the terms of extended credit facility with wells  that we expect will be under comparable terms 
credit risk the majority of our accounts receivable arise from product sales in the us however  we also have significant receivable balances from customers within the european union  japan  brazil  argentina  and mexico 
our accounts receivable in the us are primarily due from public and private hospitals 
our accounts receivable outside of the us are primarily due from independent distributors  and to a lesser extent  public and private hospitals 
our historical write offs of accounts receivable have not been significant 
we monitor the financial performance and credit worthiness of our customers so that we can properly assess and respond to changes in their credit profile 
since our customers operate in certain countries such as greece and italy  where adverse economic conditions persist  it increases the risk of our inability to collect amounts due to us from them 
to determine our allowance for doubtful accounts we consider these factors and other relevant considerations 
our allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of december   represents our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
future capital requirements we believe that the future growth of our business will depend upon our ability to successfully develop new technologies for the treatment of aortic disorders and successfully bring these technologies to market 
we expect to incur significant expenditures in completing product development and clinical trials for ventana and the nellix system 
the timing and amount of our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the need for working capital to support our sales growth  the need for additional capital to fund future development programs  the need for additional capital to fund our sales force expansion  the need for additional capital to fund strategic acquisitions  our requirements for additional facility space or manufacturing capacity  our requirements for additional information technology infrastructure and systems  and adverse outcomes from potential litigation and the cost to defend such litigation 
we believe that our world wide cash resources are adequate to operate our business 
we presently have several operating subsidiaries outside of the us as of december   these subsidiaries hold an aggregate million in foreign bank accounts to fund their local operations 
these balances and any changes thereto  are deemed by management to be permanently reinvested in the corresponding country in which our subsidiary operates 
management has no present or planned intention to repatriate these funds into to us however  in the event that we required additional funds in the us and had to repatriate any foreign held funds to meet those needs  we would then need to accrue  and ultimately pay  incremental income tax expenses on such deemed dividend  unless we then had sufficient net operating losses to offset this potential tax liability 
we expect to generate positive cash flows from operations by the second half of and beyond 
however  in the event we require additional financing in the future  it may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
even if we are able to obtain financing  it may cause substantial dilution in the case of an equity financing  or may contain burdensome restrictions on the operation of our business in the case of debt financing 
if we are not able to obtain required financing  we may need to curtail our operations and or our planned product development 
contractual obligations as of december   expected future cash payments related to contractual obligations were as follows payment due by period at december  total less than year years years after years in thousands operating lease obligations off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements except for operating leases that provide financing  liquidity  market or credit risk support  or involve derivatives 
in addition  we have no arrangements that may expose us to liability that are not expressly reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not subject to any material financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not believe that we currently have material exposure to interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate or other relevant market risks 
interest rate and market risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the wells credit facility 
all outstanding amounts under the wells credit facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to the wells prime rate  plus  which is payable on a monthly basis 
as of december   we had no amounts outstanding under the wells credit facility 
however  if we draw down the wells credit facility  we may be exposed to market risk due to changes in the rate at which interest accrues 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we are averse to principal loss and try to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in only high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to appropriately respond to a significant reduction in the credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
at december   our investment portfolio solely consisted of money market instruments 
foreign currency transaction risk 
while a majority of our business is denominated in the us dollar  a portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and the euro or the british pound sterling may affect our results of operations and the period to period comparisons of our operating results
