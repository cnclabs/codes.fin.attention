item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this form k 
these investments in product development  however  may not lead to increased revenue and profitability as we may not be successful in deploying our new products and services 
if the company is not successful in creating value from these investments  the investments and lack of new product sales could have a negative impact on the company s operating results and financial condition 
failure to keep up with rapidly changing technologies and marketing practices could cause our products and services to become less competitive or obsolete  which could result in loss of market share and decreased revenues and net income 
advances in information technology are changing the way our clients use and purchase information products and services 
maintaining the technological competitiveness of our data products  processing functionality  software systems and services is key to our continued success 
however  the complexity and uncertainty regarding the development of new technologies and the extent and timing of market acceptance of innovative products and services create difficulties in maintaining this competiveness 
without the timely introduction of new products  services and enhancements  our products and services will become technologically or commercially obsolete over time  in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer 
consumer needs and the business information industry as a whole are in a constant state of change 
for example  in recent years  we have seen a decline in the use of direct mail marketing and an increase in the use of alternative marketing channels such as online advertising 
our ability to continually improve our current processes and products in response to changes in technology and to develop new products and services are essential in maintaining our competitive position  preserving our market share and meeting the increasingly sophisticated requirements of our clients 
if we fail to enhance our current products and services or fail to develop new products in light of emerging technologies and industry standards  we could lose clients to current or future competitors  which could result in impairment of our growth prospects  loss of market share and decreased revenues 
a significant breach of the confidentiality of the information we hold or of the security of our computer systems could be detrimental to our business  reputation and results of operations 
we operate complex computer systems that contain personally identifiable data  much of which must be maintained on a confidential basis 
although we have extensive physical and cyber security and associated procedures  our databases have in the past been and in the future may be subject to unauthorized access by third parties 
such third parties could attempt to gain entry to our systems for the purpose of stealing data or disrupting the systems 
we believe we have taken adequate measures to protect our systems from intrusion  but we cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities  discovery of new vulnerabilities in our systems and attempts to exploit those vulnerabilities  physical system or facility break ins and data thefts or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology protecting our systems and the information we possess 
in the event that our protection efforts are unsuccessful and we experience an unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or the security of such information or our systems are compromised  we could suffer substantial harm 
such a security breach could result in operation disruptions that impair our ability to meet our clients requirements  which could result in decreased revenues 
also  our reputation could suffer irreparable harm  causing our current and prospective clients to reject our products and services in the future 
further  we could be forced to expend significant company resources in response to a security breach  including repairing system damage  increasing cyber security protection costs by deploying additional personnel and protection technologies  and litigating and resolving legal claims  all of which could divert the attention of our management and key personnel away from our business operations 
in any event  a significant security breach could materially harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
changes in legislative  judicial  regulatory  cultural or consumer environments relating to consumer privacy or information collection and use may limit our ability to collect and use data 
such developments could cause revenues to decline  increase the cost and availability of data and adversely affect the demand for our products and services 
with the growth of online advertising and e commerce  there is increasing awareness and concern among the general public  governmental bodies and others regarding marketing and privacy matters  particularly as they relate to individual privacy interests and global reach of the online marketplace 
see item business privacy considerations in this form k 
in the us  both congress and the legislatures of various states have recently focused their attention on matters concerning the collection and use of consumer data 
in all of the non us locations in which we do business  legislation restricting the collection and use of personal data already exists or is presently contemplated 
restrictions are often placed on the use of data upon the occurrence of unanticipated events that rapidly drive the adoption of legislation or regulation 
restrictions could be placed upon the collection  management  aggregation and use of information  which could result in a material increase in the cost of collecting certain kinds of data 
in the us  non sensitive data about a consumer is generally usable under current rules and regulations so long as the person does not affirmatively opt out of the collection of such data 
in europe the reverse is true 
if the european model were to be adopted in the us  less data would be available and the cost of data would be higher 
decreased availability and increased costs of information could adversely affect our ability to meet our clients requirements and could result in decreased revenues 
additionally  legislative  regulatory  adverse publicity  litigation or cultural changes regarding commercial use of consumer data could negatively influence  change or reduce our current and prospective clients demand for our products and services 
industry consolidations may increase competition for our products and services  which could negatively impact our financial condition and operating results 
we compete against numerous providers of products and services in several separate markets 
see item business competition in this form k 
since we offer a larger variety of products and services than many of these competitors  we have been able to successfully compete 
however  the dynamics of the marketplace would be significantly altered if several of these providers were to combine with each other to offer a wider variety of products and services that more directly compete with our portfolio of products and services 
if our competitors were to combine forces to create a single source provider of multiple products and services to the markets in which we compete  we could experience increased price competition  lower demand for our products and services  and loss of market share  each of which could negatively affect our operating results 
significant system disruptions  loss of data center capacity or interruption of telecommunication links could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our business is heavily dependent upon highly complex data processing capability 
our ability to protect our data centers against damage or interruption from fire  flood  tornadoes  power loss  telecommunications or equipment failure or other disasters and events beyond our control is critical to our continued success 
the online services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunication providers 
we believe we have taken reasonable precautions to protect our data centers and telecommunication links from events that could interrupt our operations 
any damage to our data centers or any failure of our telecommunications links that causes loss of data center capacity or otherwise causes interruptions in our operations  however  could materially adversely affect our ability to quickly and effectively respond to our clients requirements  which could result in loss of their confidence  adversely impact our ability to attract new clients and force us to expend significant company resources to repair the damage 
such events could result in decreased revenues  net income  and earnings per share 
each of our business segments is subject to substantial competition from a diverse group of competitors 
new products and pricing strategies introduced by these competitors in the markets where our products and services are offered could decrease our market share or cause us to lower our prices in a manner that reduces our operating margin and the profitability of our products 
each of our business segments faces significant competition in all of its offerings and within each of its markets 
see item business competition in this form k 
our competitors for marketing and data services include database marketing services providers  dmps data management platforms  data companies and data distributors  some of whom may have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing or other resources allocated to serving customers 
other types of companies such as technology consultants  business process outsourcers  analytics consultants and management consultants participate to a lesser extent in portions of our market space 
additionally  we compete with the in house it departments of some of our existing and prospective clients that have developed or are developing the in house capacity to perform the services we provide 
our competitors for it infrastructure management include managed it and full service cloud providers  and our competitors for other services include a range of providers 
maintaining technological competitiveness in our data products  processing functionality  software systems and services  continually improving our current processes  and developing and introducing new products and services are necessary to maintain our competitive position 
if we fail to do so  we could lose clients to current or future competitors  which could result in decreased revenues  net income and earnings per share 
the resources we allocate to each market in which we compete vary  as do the number and size of our competitors across these markets 
these competitors may be in a better position to develop new products and pricing strategies that more quickly and effectively respond to changes in customer requirements in these markets 
some of our competitors may choose to sell products or services competitive to ours at lower prices by accepting lower margins and profitability  or may be able to sell products or services competitive to ours at lower prices given proprietary ownership of data  technical superiority or economies of scale 
such introduction of competent  competitive products  pricing strategies or other technologies by our competitors that are superior to or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services could adversely affect our business 
in such event  we could experience a decline in market share and be forced to reduce our prices  resulting in lower profit margins for the company 
engagements with certain clients  particularly those with long term  fixed price agreements  may prove to be more costly than anticipated  thereby adversely impacting future operating results 
the pricing and other terms of our client contracts  particularly our long term it infrastructure management agreements  are based on estimates and assumptions we make at the time we enter into these contracts 
these estimates reflect our best judgments regarding the nature of the engagement and our expected costs to provide the contracted services and could differ from actual results 
any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these engagements  including delays caused by factors outside our control  could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable  which would have an adverse effect on our profit margin 
our exposure to this risk increases generally in proportion to the scope of the client contract and is higher in the early stages of such a contract 
in addition  a majority of our it infrastructure management contracts contain some fixed price  incentive based or other pricing terms that condition our fee on our ability to meet defined goals 
our failure to meet a client s expectations in any type of contract may result in an unprofitable engagement  which could adversely affect our operating results and result in future rejection of our products and services by current and prospective clients 
the failure to recruit and retain qualified personnel could hinder our ability to successfully manage our business  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results 
our growth strategy and future success depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain technical  client services  sales  consulting  research and development  marketing  administrative and management personnel 
the complexity of our data products  processing functionality  software systems and services requires highly trained professionals 
while we presently have a sophisticated  dedicated and experienced team of associates who have a deep understanding of our business and in many cases have been with acxiom for decades  the labor market for these individuals has historically been very competitive due to the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding  compensation strategies  general economic conditions and various other factors 
as the business information and marketing industries continue to become more technologically advanced  we anticipate increased competition for qualified personnel 
the loss or prolonged absence of the services of highly trained personnel like the company s current team of associates  or the inability to recruit and retain additional  qualified associates  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position or operating results 
additionally  in recent years  we experienced significant changes in our executive leadership  including the appointment of a new chief executive officer  chief financial officer  chief revenue officer and chief product and engineering officer 
continuing or unexpected turnover in key leadership positions within the company may adversely impact our ability to manage the company efficiently and effectively  could be disruptive and distracting to management and may lead to additional departures of existing personnel  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  financial results and internal controls over financial reporting 
processing errors or delays in completing service level requirements could result in loss of client confidence  harm to our reputation and negative financial consequences 
processing errors  or significant errors and defects in our products  can be harmful to our business and result in increases in operating costs 
such errors may result in the issuance of credits to clients  re performance of work  payment of damages  future rejection of our products and services by current and prospective clients and irreparable harm to our reputation 
likewise  the failure to meet contractual service level requirements or to meet specified goals within contractual timeframes could result in monetary penalties or lost revenue 
taken together  these issues could result in loss of revenue and decreases in profit margins as service and support costs increase 
data suppliers may withdraw data that we have previously collected or withhold data from us in the future  leading to our inability to provide products and services to our clients which could lead to a decrease in revenue and loss of client confidence 
much of the data that we use is either purchased or licensed from third party data suppliers  and we are dependent upon our ability to obtain necessary data licenses on commercially reasonable terms 
we compile the remainder of the data that we use from public record sources 
we could suffer material adverse consequences if our data suppliers were to withhold their data from us  which could occur either because we fail to maintain sufficient relationships with the suppliers or if they decline to provide or are prohibited from providing such data to us due to legal  contractual  privacy  competition or other economic concerns 
for example  data suppliers could withhold their data from us if there is a competitive reason to do so  if we breach our contract with a supplier  if they are acquired by one of our competitors  if legislation is passed restricting the use of the data they provide  or if judicial interpretations are issued restricting use of such data 
additionally  we could terminate relationships with our data suppliers if they fail to adhere to our data quality standards 
if a substantial number of data suppliers were to withdraw or withhold their data from us  our ability to provide products and services to our clients could be materially adversely impacted  which could result in decreased revenues  net income and earnings per share 
a failure in the integrity or a reduction in the quality of our data could harm our brand and result in a loss of revenue and an increase in legal claims 
the reliability of our solutions is dependent upon the integrity and quality of the data in our database 
a failure in the integrity of our database  whether inadvertently or through the actions of a third party  or a reduction in the quality of our data could harm us by exposing us to client or third party claims or by causing a loss of client confidence in our solutions 
we may experience an increase in risks to the integrity of our database and quality of our data as we move toward real time  anonymous  consumer powered data through our enterprise data management platform 
we must continue to invest in our database to improve and maintain the quality  timeliness and coverage of the data if we are to maintain our competitive position and retain our clients confidence 
failure to do so could result in significant harm to our reputation and growth prospects  as well as a loss of revenue 
the loss of a contract upon which we rely for a significant portion of our revenues could adversely affect our operating results 
our ten largest clients represented approximately of our revenue in fiscal year  but no single client accounted for more than of the revenues of the company as a whole 
the loss of  or decrease in revenue from  any of our significant clients for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating results 
while a significant amount of our total revenue is currently derived from clients who have long term contracts defined as contracts with initial terms of two years or more  these contracts have been entered into at various times  and some of them are in the latter part of their terms and are approaching their originally scheduled expiration dates 
in addition  many of these contracts contain provisions allowing the client to terminate prior to the end of the term upon giving advance notice 
even if renewed by these clients  the terms of the renewal contracts may not have a term as long as  or may otherwise be on terms less favorable than  the original contract 
revenue from clients with long term contracts is not necessarily fixed or guaranteed as portions of the revenue from these clients is volume driven or project related 
with respect to the portion of our business that is not under long term contract  revenues are even less predictable and are almost completely volume driven or project related 
therefore  we must engage in continual sales efforts to maintain revenue stability and future growth with all of our clients or our operating results will suffer 
if a significant client fails to renew a contract  or renews the contract on terms less favorable to us than before  our business could be negatively impacted if additional business were not obtained to replace or supplement that which was lost 
acquisition and divestiture activities may disrupt our ongoing business and may involve increased expenses  and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals contemplated at the time of a transaction  all of which could adversely affect our business and growth prospects 
historically  we have engaged in acquisitions to grow our business 
to the extent we find suitable and attractive acquisition candidates and business opportunities in the future  we may continue to acquire other complementary businesses  products and technologies and enter into joint ventures or similar strategic relationships 
while we believe we will be able to successfully integrate newly acquired businesses into our existing operations  there is no certainty that future acquisitions or alliances will be consummated on acceptable terms or that we will be able to integrate successfully the services  content  products and personnel of any such transaction into our operations 
in addition  any future acquisitions  joint ventures or similar relationships may cause a disruption in our ongoing business and distract our management 
further  we may be unable to realize the revenue improvements  cost savings and other intended benefits of any such transaction 
the occurrence of any of these events could result in decreased revenues  net income and earnings per share 
we have also divested assets in the past and may do so again in the future 
as with acquisitions  divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties  such as disruption of our ongoing business reductions of our revenues or earnings per share unanticipated liabilities  legal risks and costs the potential loss of key personnel distraction of management from our ongoing business impairment of relationships with employees and clients as a result of migrating a business to new owners 
because acquisitions and divestitures are inherently risky  transactions we undertake may not be successful and may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill 
the impairment of a significant portion of this asset would negatively affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
goodwill is a significant portion of our total assets 
goodwill accounted for approximately and of the total assets on our balance sheet as of march  and  respectively 
we may not realize the full carrying value of our goodwill 
goodwill is measured and tested for impairment on an annual basis in the first quarter of the company s fiscal year and between annual tests if an event occurs or changes in circumstances suggest a potential decline in the fair value of goodwill 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator or change in circumstances relating to impairment has occurred 
if testing indicates that impairment has occurred  we would be required to write off the impaired portion of goodwill  resulting in a charge to our earnings 
an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
our business is directly dependent upon and correlates closely to the marketing levels and ongoing business activities of our existing clients 
if material adverse developments in domestic and global economic and market conditions adversely affect our clients businesses  our business and results of operations could equally suffer 
we serve clients around the world from locations in the asia pacific region  europe  south america and the united states 
our client list includes many of the largest organizations in these regions across most major industry verticals  including but not limited to financial  insurance and investment services  automotive  retail  telecommunications  high tech  healthcare  travel  entertainment  non profit and government 
our results of operations are affected directly by the level of business activity of our clients  which in turn is affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets that they serve 
future widespread economic slowdowns in any of these markets  particularly in the united states  may negatively affect the businesses  purchasing decisions and spending of our clients and prospective clients  which could result in reductions in our existing business as well as our new business development 
in the event of such widespread economic downturn  we will likely experience a reduction in current projects  longer sales cycles  deferral or delay of purchase commitments for our data products  processing functionality  software systems and services  and increased price competition  all of which could adversely affect our revenue and operating results 
our operations outside the us are subject to risks that may harm the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
during the last fiscal year  we received approximately of our revenues from business outside the united states 
the cost of executing our business plan in non us locations is increasingly expensive 
in those non us locations where legislation restricting the collection and use of personal data currently exists  less data is available and at a much higher cost 
in some foreign markets  the types of products and services we offer have not been generally available and thus are not fully understood by prospective clients 
upon entering these markets  we have to educate and condition the markets  increasing the cost and difficulty of successfully executing our business plan in these markets 
additionally  each of our foreign locations is generally expected to fund its own operations and cash flows  although periodically funds may be loaned or invested from the us to the foreign subsidiaries 
as a result of such loan or investment  exchange rate movements of foreign currencies may have an impact on our future costs of  or future cash flows from  foreign investments 
we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
additional risks inherent in our non us business activities generally include  among others  potentially longer accounts receivable payment cycles  the costs and difficulties of managing international operations  potentially adverse tax consequences  and greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights 
the various risks which are inherent in doing business in the us are also generally applicable to doing business outside of the us  but such risks may be exaggerated by factors normally associated with international operations  such as differences in culture  laws and regulations  especially restrictions on collection  management  aggregation and use of information 
failure to effectively manage the risks facing our non us business activities could materially adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  when operating in foreign jurisdictions  we must comply with complex foreign and us laws and regulations  such as the us foreign corrupt practices act  the uk bribery act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials  as well as anti competition regulations 
violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties  criminal sanctions  restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries 
such violations could also adversely affect our reputation with existing and prospective clients  which could negatively impact our operating results and growth prospects 
our products and services have long and variable sales cycles due to their nature as enterprise wide solutions 
failure to accurately predict these sales cycles could impair our ability to forecast operating results  which could result in a decline in the market value of our stock 
when purchasing our products and services  our clients and prospects are often faced with a significant commitment of capital  the need to integrate new software and or hardware platforms across multiple business units and other changes in company wide operational procedures  all of which result in cautious deliberation and evaluation by prospective clients  longer sales cycles and delays in completing transactions 
additional delays result from the significant up front expenses and substantial time  effort and other resources necessary of our clients to implement our solutions 
for example  depending on the size of a prospective client s business and its needs  a sales cycle can range from two weeks to nine months 
because of these longer sales cycles  revenues and operating results may vary significantly from period to period 
as a result  it is often difficult to accurately forecast our revenues on a quarterly basis as it is not always possible for us to predict the quarter in which sales will actually be completed 
this difficulty in predicting revenue  combined with the revenue fluctuations we may experience from quarter to quarter  can adversely affect and cause substantial fluctuations in our stock price 
third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services 
additionally  third parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 
as our business is focused on data driven results and analytics  we rely heavily on proprietary information technology  processes and other protectable intellectual property rights 
from time to time  third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights 
we analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis 
any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time consuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation  which could divert the attention of our management and key personnel away from our business operations 
a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement  which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all  or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services 
our proprietary portfolio is comprised of various intellectual property rights  including patents  copyrights  database rights  source code  trademarks  trade secrets  know how  confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements 
the extent to which such rights can be protected varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
if we do not enforce our intellectual property rights vigorously and successfully  our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results 
our brand and reputation are key assets and competitive strengths of our company  and our business may be adversely affected if events occur that could cause us to be negatively perceived in the marketplace 
for over years acxiom has been a thought leader and innovator in solving large scale data problems and improving marketing results through high performance  highly scalable  highly secured and privacy compliant marketing solutions  with a track record of building strong technology and being an innovator in the marketing services space 
our brand and reputation earned over these years are key assets of the company 
our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of data quality  our ability to deliver consumer insights  our enterprise data management and analytical capabilities  the competence of our current associate team  and our ability to meet contractual service level requirements in a timely manner 
negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters could damage our reputation with prospective clients and the public generally 
adverse developments with respect to our industry may also  by association  negatively impact our reputation  or result in higher regulatory or legislative scrutiny 
any damage to our brand or reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
failure to recover significant  up front capital investments required by certain client contracts could be harmful to the company s financial condition and operating results 
certain of our client contracts require significant investment in the early stages  which we expect to recover through billings over the life of the contract 
these contracts may involve the construction of new computer systems and communications networks or the development and deployment of new technologies 
substantial performance risk exists in each contract with these characteristics  and some or all elements of service delivery under these contracts are dependent upon successful completion of the development  construction and deployment phases 
failure to successfully meet our contractual requirements under these contracts over their life increases the possibility that we may not recover our capital investments in these contracts 
failure to recover our capital investments could be detrimental to the profitability of the particular engagement as well as our operating results 
the decline in direct mail business could occur more rapidly than we are able to offset with new revenues from investments in new products and services  which could  in turn  negatively impact revenue  net income and profit margins 
postal rate increases are expected to continue 
the most recent increase in the us was announced in october and became effective in as postal costs continue to rise  we expect to see increased pressure on direct mailers to leverage digital and other forms of online communication and to mail fewer pieces 
the concerns of direct mailers are further exacerbated by the on going financial struggles of the united states postal service usps 
in recent years  the usps has incurred significant financial losses and may  as a result  implement significant changes to the breadth or frequency of its mail delivery 
in  the usps announced its plan to cut billions of dollars in operating costs by in hopes of returning to profitability 
the proposed cuts have included  among other things  terminating saturday mail delivery subject to congressional approval and closing approximately half of its mail processing centers across the united states 
the usps recently announced the planned closure of mail processing centers in these changes are expected to increase mail processing time and slow delivery frequency  which in turn may decrease marketers and the general public s willingness to continue to use traditional mail  which may negatively impact our direct mail clients and thus the company s revenue derived from our traditional direct marketing business 
additionally  those in the traditional direct mail business  as well as the usps  are under growing pressure to reduce their impact on the environment 
it is uncertain at this time what either marketers or the usps will do to lessen their impact 
from a postal service perspective  the actions to be taken may involve changing certain aspects of mail service that would negatively affect direct marketers 
from a marketer s perspective  such actions could have the same effect as increased rates  thereby causing them to mail fewer pieces  which may negatively impact the company s revenue derived from our traditional direct marketing business

risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of one percentage point in short term market interest rates 
if short term market interest rates increase one percentage point during the next four quarters compared to the previous four quarters  there would be no material adverse impact on acxiom s results of operations 
acxiom has no material future earnings or cash flow expenses from changes in interest rates related to its other long term debt obligations  as substantially all of acxiom s remaining long term debt instruments have fixed rates 
at both march  and  the fair value of the company s fixed rate long term obligations approximated carrying value 
acxiom has a presence in the united kingdom  france  germany  poland  australia  china and brazil 
in general  each of the foreign locations is expected to fund its own operations and cash flows  although funds may be loaned or invested from the us to the foreign subsidiaries 
therefore  exchange rate movements of foreign currencies may have an impact on acxiom s future costs or on future cash flows from foreign investments 
acxiom has not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
