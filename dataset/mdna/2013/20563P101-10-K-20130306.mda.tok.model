item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
business segments we currently have two operating business segments security products  and marine components 
for additional information regarding our segments  see part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to the consolidated financial statements 
manufacturing  operations and products security products 
our security products segment  with one manufacturing facility in south carolina and one in illinois shared with marine components  manufactures mechanical and electronic cabinet locks and other locking mechanisms used in a variety of applications including ignition systems  mailboxes  file cabinets  desk drawers  tool storage cabinets  vending and gaming machines  high security medical cabinetry  electrical circuit panels  storage compartments and gas station security 
we believe we are a north american market leader in the manufacture and sale of cabinet locks and other locking mechanisms 
these products include 
table of contents disc tumbler locks which provide moderate security and generally represent the lowest cost lock to produce  pin tumbler locking mechanisms which are more costly to produce and are used in applications requiring higher levels of security  including keset and system which each allow the user to change the keying on a single lock times without removing the lock from its enclosure and tubar  and our innovative compx elock and stealthlock electronic locks which provide stand alone or networked security and audit trail capability for drug storage and other valuables through the use of a proximity card  magnetic stripe or keypad credentials 
a substantial portion of our security products sales consist of products with specialized adaptations to an individual customer s specifications  some of which are listed above 
we also have a standardized product line suitable for many customers  which is offered through a north american distribution network to locksmith distributors and smaller original equipment manufacturers oems via our stock locks distribution program 
marine components 
our marine components segment  with a facility in wisconsin and a facility shared with security products in illinois  manufactures and distributes stainless steel exhaust components  gauges  throttle controls  hardware and accessories primarily for performance and ski wakeboard boats 
our specialty marine component products are high precision components designed to operate within tight tolerances in the highly demanding marine environment 
these products include original equipment and aftermarket stainless steel exhaust headers  exhaust pipes  mufflers and other exhaust components  high performance gauges such as gps speedometers and tachometers  mechanical and electronic controls and throttles  steering wheels and other billet aluminum accessories  and dash panels  led lighting  wire harnesses and other accessories 
our business segments operated three manufacturing facilities at december  for additional information  see also item properties  including information regarding leased and distribution only facilities 
security products marine components mauldin  sc grayslake  il neenah  wi grayslake  il raw materials our primary raw materials are zinc and brass used in the security products segment for the manufacture of locking mechanisms  and stainless steel used primarily in the marine components segment for the manufacture of exhaust headers and pipes and other components 
these raw materials are purchased from several suppliers  are readily available from numerous sources and accounted for approximately of our total cost of sales for 
table of contents we occasionally enter into short term supply arrangements for our commodity related raw materials to mitigate the impact of future increases in raw material prices that are affected by commodity markets 
these arrangements generally provide for stated unit prices based upon specified purchase volumes  which help us stabilize our commodity related raw material costs to a certain extent 
commodity related raw materials purchased outside of these arrangements are sometimes subject to unanticipated and sudden price increases 
we generally seek to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in these raw material costs on our margins through improvements in production efficiencies or other operating cost reductions 
in the event we are unable to offset raw material cost increases with other cost reductions  it may be difficult to recover those cost increases through increased product selling prices or raw material surcharges due to the competitive nature of the markets served by our products 
consequently  overall operating margins can be affected by commodity related raw material cost pressures 
commodity market prices are cyclical  reflecting overall economic trends  specific developments in consuming industries and speculative investor activities 
patents and trademarks we hold a number of patents relating to our component products  certain of which are believed to be important to us and our continuing business activity 
patents generally have a term of years  and our patents have remaining terms ranging from to years at december  our major trademarks and brand names include security products marine components compx security products custom marine national cabinet lock fort lock fort timberline chicago lock stock locks keset tubar stealthlock ace ace ii compx elock lockview system livorsi marine livorsi ii marine cmi industrial mufflers custom marine stainless exhaust the choice in performance boating mega rim race rim compx marine vantage view gen x sales  marketing and distribution 
a majority of our component sales are direct to large oem customers through our factory based sales and marketing professionals supported by engineers working in concert with field salespeople and independent manufacturer s representatives 
we select manufacturer s representatives based on special skills in certain markets or relationships with current or potential customers 
in addition to sales to large oem customers  a significant portion of our security products sales are made through distributors 
we have a significant north american market share of cabinet lock security product sales as a result of the locksmith distribution channel 
we support our locksmith distributor sales with a line of standardized products used by the largest segments of the marketplace 
these products are packaged and merchandised for easy availability and handling by distributors and end users 

table of contents in  our ten largest customers  all customers of our security products segment  accounted for approximately of our total sales 
harley davidson accounted for approximately of total sales for the year ended december  overall  our customer base is diverse and the loss of any single customer would not in itself have a material adverse effect on our operations 
competition the markets in which we participate are highly competitive 
we compete primarily on the basis of product design  including ergonomic and aesthetic factors  product quality and durability  price  on time delivery  service and technical support 
we focus our efforts on the middle and high end segments of the market  where product design  quality  durability and service are valued by the customer 
our security products segment competes against a number of domestic and foreign manufacturers 
our marine components segment competes with small domestic manufacturers and is minimally affected by foreign competitors 
regulatory and environmental matters our operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the use  storage  handling  generation  transportation  treatment  emission  discharge  disposal  remediation of and exposure to hazardous and non hazardous substances  materials and wastes environmental laws 
our operations also are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety 
we believe we are in substantial compliance with all such laws and regulations 
to date  the costs of maintaining compliance with such laws and regulations have not significantly impacted our results 
we currently do not anticipate any significant costs or expenses relating to such matters  however  it is possible future laws and regulations may require us to incur significant additional expenditures 
discontinued operations on december   we completed the sale of our furniture components segment to a competitor of that segment for proceeds net of expenses of approximately million in cash 
we recognized a pre tax gain of approximately million on the disposal of these operations million  net of income taxes of approximately million

item a 
risk factors listed below are certain risk factors associated with us and our businesses 
in addition to the potential effect of these risk factors discussed below  any risk factor which could result in reduced earnings or operating losses  or reduced liquidity  could in turn adversely affect our ability to service our liabilities or pay dividends on our common stock or adversely affect the quoted market prices for our securities 
many of the markets in which we operate are mature and highly competitive resulting in pricing pressure and the need to continuously reduce costs 
many of the markets we serve are highly competitive  with a number of competitors offering similar products 
we focus our efforts on the middle and high end segment of the market where we feel that we can compete due to the importance of product design  quality and durability to the customer 
however  our ability to effectively compete is impacted by a number of factors 
the occurrence of any of these factors could result in reduced earnings or operating losses 
competitors may be able to drive down prices for our products beyond our ability to adjust costs because their costs are lower than ours  especially products sourced from asia 
competitors financial  technological and other resources may be greater than our resources  which may enable them to more effectively withstand changes in market conditions 
competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
consolidation of our competitors or customers in any of the markets in which we compete may result in reduced demand for our products 
new competitors could emerge by modifying their existing production facilities to manufacture products that compete with our products 
we may not be able to sustain a cost structure that enables us to be competitive 
customers may no longer value our product design  quality or durability over the lower cost products of our competitors 
our development of innovative features for current products is critical to sustaining and growing our sales 
historically  our ability to provide value added custom engineered products that address requirements of technology and space utilization has been a key element of our success 
we spend a significant amount of time and effort to refine  improve and adapt our existing products for new customers and applications 
since expenditures for these types of activities are not considered research and 
table of contents development expense under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  the amount of our research and development expenditures  which is not significant  is not indicative of the overall effort involved in the development of new product features 
the introduction of new product features requires the coordination of the design  manufacturing and marketing of the new product features with current and potential customers 
the ability to coordinate these activities with current and potential customers may be affected by factors beyond our control 
while we will continue to emphasize the introduction of innovative new product features that target customer specific opportunities  there can be no assurance that any new product features we introduce will achieve the same degree of success that we have achieved with our existing products 
introduction of new product features typically requires us to increase production volume on a timely basis while maintaining product quality 
manufacturers often encounter difficulties in increasing production volumes  including delays  quality control problems and shortages of qualified personnel or raw materials 
as we attempt to introduce new product features in the future  there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase production volume without encountering these or other problems  which might negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations 
future acquisitions could subject us to a number of operational risks 
a key component of our strategy is to grow and diversify our business through targeted acquisitions 
our ability to successfully execute this component of our strategy entails a number of risks  including the identification of suitable growth opportunities  an inaccurate assessment of acquired liabilities that were undisclosed or not properly disclosed  the entry into markets in which we may have limited or no experience  the diversion of management s attention from our core businesses  the potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired businesses  the potential of not identifying that acquired products infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies  synergies and cost savings  and an increase in our indebtedness and a limitation in our ability to access additional capital when needed 
higher costs of our commodity related raw materials may decrease our liquidity 
certain of the raw materials used in our products are commodities that are subject to significant fluctuations in price in response to world wide supply and demand as well as speculative investor activity 
zinc and brass are the principal raw materials used in the manufacture of security products 
stainless steel tubing is the major raw material used in the manufacture of marine exhaust systems 
these raw materials are purchased from several suppliers and are generally readily available from numerous sources 
we occasionally enter into short term raw material supply arrangements to mitigate the impact of future increases in commodity raw material costs 
materials purchased outside of these arrangements are sometimes subject to unanticipated and sudden price increases 
should our vendors not be able to meet their contractual obligations or should we be otherwise unable to obtain necessary raw materials  we may incur higher costs for raw materials or may be required to reduce production levels  either of which may decrease our liquidity as we may be unable to offset the higher costs with increases in our selling prices or reductions in other operating costs 

table of contents failure to protect our intellectual property rights or claims by others that we infringe their intellectual property rights could substantially harm our business 
we rely on patent  trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and similar laws in other countries to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights in our technology and designs 
despite these measures  any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged  invalidated  circumvented or misappropriated 
others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information  and in such cases we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties 
further  there can be no assurance that any of our pending trademark or patent applications will be approved 
costly and time consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our intellectual property rights 
in addition  the laws of certain countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
therefore  in certain jurisdictions  we may be unable to protect our technology and designs adequately against unauthorized third party use  which could adversely affect our competitive position 
third parties may claim that we or our customers are infringing upon their intellectual property rights 
even if we believe that such claims are without merit  they can be time consuming and costly to defend and distract our management s and technical staff s attention and resources 
claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected technology  enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards  or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our technology 
if we cannot or do not license the infringed technology on reasonable pricing terms or at all  or substitute similar technology from another source  our business could be adversely impacted 
global climate change legislation could negatively impact our financial results or limit our ability to operate our businesses 
all of our production facilities are located in the united states and we believe all of our production facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws 
legislation has been passed  or proposed legislation is being considered  to limit green house gases through various means  including emissions permits and or energy taxes 
to date the climate change legislation in effect has not had a material adverse effect on our financial results 
however  if green house gas legislation were to be enacted  it could negatively impact our future results from operations through increased costs of production  particularly as it relates to our energy requirements 
if such increased costs of production were to materialize  we may be unable to pass price increases onto our customers to compensate for increased production costs  which may decrease our liquidity  operating income and results of operations

in  we sold our furniture components segment for a net gain of million which is included in discontinued operations 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we are a leading manufacturer of engineered components utilized in a variety of applications and industries 
through our security products segment we manufacture mechanical and electrical cabinet locks and other locking mechanisms used in recreational transportation  postal  office and institutional furniture  cabinetry  tool storage and healthcare applications 
we also manufacture stainless steel exhaust systems  gauges and throttle controls for the recreational marine industry through our marine components segment 
on december   we completed the sale of our furniture components segment to a competitor of that segment for proceeds net of expenses of approximately million in cash 
we recognized a pre tax gain of approximately million on the disposal of these operations million  net of income taxes of approximately million 
our furniture components segment primarily sold products with lower average margins and higher commodity raw material content than other segments of our business 
we believe disposing of our furniture components segment will enable us to focus more effort on continuing to develop the remaining portion of our business that we believe has greater opportunity for higher returns and with less volatility in the cost of commodity raw materials 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
unless otherwise noted the results of operations in management s discussion and analysis is focused on continuing operations 
operating income overview we reported operating income of million in compared to operating income of million in and million in the comparison between and was primarily impacted by the positive impact of higher sales in from an increase in customer order rates across most markets due to somewhat improved economic conditions in north america  the negative impact of an increase in self insured medical costs  and the negative impact of an increase in general and administrative expenses in the comparison between and was primarily impacted by the positive impact of higher sales in from an increase in customer order rates across most markets due to somewhat improved economic conditions in north america  the positive impact of a decrease in self insured medical costs  the negative impact on margins in from higher raw material costs  and the negative impact of a higher write down on assets held for sale in our product offerings consist of a significantly large number of products that have a wide variation in selling price and manufacturing cost  which results in certain practical limitations on our ability to quantify the impact of changes in individual product sales quantities and selling prices on our net sales  cost of goods sold and gross profit 
in addition  small variations in period to period net sales  cost of goods sold and gross profit can result from changes in the relative mix of our products sold 

table of contents results of operations compared to and compared to years ended december  change dollars in millions net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating costs and expenses write down and loss on disposal of assets held for sale operating income percent of net sales cost of goods sold gross margin operating costs and expenses write down and loss on disposal of assets held for sale operating income net sales 
net sales increased approximately million in principally due to growth in customer demand within both of our segments resulting from somewhat improved economic conditions in north america 
additionally  marine components experienced a  increase in sales to the ski wakeboard boat market 
relative changes in selling prices did not have a material impact on net sales comparisons 
net sales increased approximately million in as compared to principally due to improved sales in the security products segment 
security products experienced a significant increase in sales to customers in the leisure transportation industry as well as improved customer order rates across most markets as a result of some improvement in the economy and new specific customer projects 
net sales growth for marine components was not significant from to costs of goods sold and gross margin 
cost of goods sold and gross profit both increased from to primarily due to increased sales volumes 
as a percentage of sales  cost of goods sold increased resulting in a decrease in gross margin of primarily due to the net effects of the increase in sales partially offset by higher self insured medical costs 
cost of goods sold increased from to primarily due to increased sales volumes 
as a percentage of sales  gross margin increased in from the prior year 
the gross margin percentage was positively impacted by the increased leverage of fixed costs from higher sales and lower self insured medical costs 
operating costs and expenses 
operating costs and expenses consists primarily of sales and administrative related personnel costs  sales commissions and advertising expenses directly related to product sales and administrative costs relating to business unit and corporate management activities  as well as gains and losses on plant  property and equipment 
operating costs and expenses increased in as compared to as a result of increased administrative support costs relating to the higher sales and higher costs relating to the assets held for sale

the write downs are included in corporate operating expense 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
operating income 
as a percentage of net sales  operating income decreased by in compared to and was primarily impacted by the factors impacting cost of goods sold  gross margin and operating costs discussed above 
as a percentage of net sales  operating income was comparable in and general our profitability primarily depends on our ability to utilize our production capacity effectively  which is affected by  among other things  the demand for our products and our ability to control our manufacturing costs  primarily comprised of labor costs and materials 
the materials used in our products consist of purchased components and raw materials some of which are subject to fluctuations in the commodity markets such as zinc  brass and stainless steel 
total material costs represented approximately of our cost of sales in  with commodity related raw materials accounting for approximately of our cost of sales 
worldwide commodity raw material costs began increasing in the second half of and continued increasing throughout  although during they were mostly stable 
we occasionally enter into short term commodity related raw material supply arrangements to mitigate the impact of future increases in commodity related raw material costs 
these arrangements generally provide for stated unit prices based upon specified purchase volumes  which helps us to stabilize commodity related raw material purchase prices to a certain extent 
we enter into such arrangements for zinc and brass 
we expect commodity related raw material prices to increase in in conjunction with higher demand as a result of the expected growth in the world wide economy 
these raw materials purchased on the spot market are sometimes subject to unanticipated and sudden price increases 
we generally seek to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in commodity raw material costs on our margins through improvements in production efficiencies or other operating cost reductions 
in the event we are unable to offset cost increases for these raw materials with other cost reductions  it may be difficult to recover those cost increases through increased product selling prices or raw material surcharges due to the competitive nature of the markets served by our products 
consequently  overall operating margins may be affected by raw material cost pressures 
interest income interest income decreased in compared primarily due to the maturity of our million promissory note receivable in october and lower cash balances available for investment 
interest income was comparable at  in and  in which includes interest on our million note receivable discussed above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we expect our interest income to increase in as a result of higher cash balances available for investment 
interest expense interest expense decreased in compared to as a result of the significant reduction to the note payable of million in october of interest expense was comparable from to the average interest rate on the note payable at december    and was   and 
our outstanding balance on the credit facility through october of was million which was repaid in full in november of in addition  we averaged million

we expect our interest expense to decrease in as a result of lower debt balances outstanding 
provision for income taxes a tabular reconciliation between our effective income tax rate and the us federal statutory income tax rate of is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a member of the group of companies consolidated for us federal income tax purposes with contran  the parent of our consolidated us federal income tax group  we compute our provision for income taxes on a separate company basis  using the tax elections made by contran 
our effective income tax rate attributable to continuing operations decreased from in to in our effective income tax rate attributable to continuing operations increased from in to in the changes in our provision for income taxes is primarily related to changes in our deferred income tax asset valuation allowance  an expense of  in and a benefit of  in see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
we currently expect our effective income tax rate for to be higher than our effective rate for discontinued operations on december   we completed the sale of our furniture components segment to a competitor of that segment for proceeds net of expenses of approximately million in cash 
we recognized a pre tax gain of approximately million on the disposal of these operations million  net of income taxes of approximately million

security products net sales increased to million in compared to million in the increase in sales is primarily due to somewhat improved economic conditions in north america resulting in higher order rates across most markets 
gross margin and operating income percentages decreased in compared to by one percentage point primarily due to higher self insured medical costs of  in   of which impacted cost of goods sold and  of which impacted selling and administration expenses 
the impact of the higher medical costs on cost of goods sold was partially offset by a  decrease in depreciation expense relating to the timing of historical capital expenditures and retirements 
the medical costs were more in line with the historical average annual medical costs as compared to an unusually favorable security products net sales increased to million in compared to million in the increase in sales is primarily due to improved customer order rates across most markets with a greater increase among leisure transportation market customers resulting from some improvement in the economic conditions in north america and specific customer projects 
gross margin and operating income percentages increased in compared to by one percentage point due to greater leverage of fixed manufacturing costs on the higher level of sales in and lower self insured medical costs of   of which impacted cost of goods sold and  of which impacted selling and administration expenses 
although sales increased by million from to  fixed manufacturing expenses were comparable between years as a  decrease in depreciation expense relating to the timing of historical capital expenditures and retirements and  of the above noted decrease in medical costs offset an increase in other fixed manufacturing expenses associated with the increase in sales 

table of contents marine components 
marine components net sales increased in as compared to the increase was primarily the result of a  increase in sales to the ski wakeboard boat market in connection with new products developed for that market 
as a percentage of net sales  gross margin and the operating loss percentage improved in compared to primarily due to increased leverage of fixed costs as a result of the higher sales and lower intangible amortization expense due to intangibles that became fully amortized in the first six months of marine components net sales increased in as compared to as a percentage of net sales  gross margin was flat over the comparative period 
operating loss percentage improved in compared to primarily due to increased leverage of fixed costs as a result of the higher sales and lower intangible amortization expense due to intangibles that became fully amortized in and the first six months of outlook consistent with the current state of the north american economy  overall demand from our customers continues to be subject to instability 
while we experienced some increase in customer demand across most markets in  it is uncertain the extent that sales will continue to grow during while changes in market demand are not within our control  we are focused on the areas we can impact 
staffing levels are continuously evaluated in relation to sales order rates which may result in headcount adjustments  to the extent possible  to match staffing levels with demand 
we expect our continuous lean manufacturing and cost improvement initiatives to positively impact our productivity and result in a more efficient infrastructure 
additionally  we continue to seek opportunities to gain market share in markets we currently serve  to expand into new markets and to develop new product features in order to mitigate the impact of changes in demand as well as broaden our sales base 
volatility in the costs of commodity raw materials is ongoing 
our primary commodity raw materials are zinc  brass and stainless steel  which together represent approximately of our total cost of goods sold 
we generally seek to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in commodity raw material costs on our margins through improvements in production efficiencies or other operating cost reductions 
in the event we are unable to offset commodity raw material cost increases with other cost reductions  it may be difficult to recover those cost increases through increased product selling prices or surcharges due to the competitive nature of the markets served by our products 
additionally  significant surcharges may negatively affect our margins as they typically only recover the increased cost of the raw material without adding margin dollars resulting in a lower margin percentage 
consequently  overall operating margins may be negatively affected by commodity raw material cost pressures 
liquidity and capital resources summary 
our primary source of liquidity on an on going basis is our cash flow from operating activities  which is generally used to i fund capital expenditures  ii repay short term or long term indebtedness incurred primarily for capital expenditures  business combinations or buying back shares of our outstanding stock and iii provide for the payment of dividends if declared 
from time to time  we will incur indebtedness to fund capital expenditures  business combinations or other investment activities 
in addition  from time to time  we may also sell assets outside the ordinary course of business  the proceeds of which are generally used to repay indebtedness including indebtedness which may have been collateralized by the assets sold or to fund capital expenditures or business combinations 

table of contents consolidated cash flows 
operating activities 
trends in cash flows from operating activities  excluding changes in assets and liabilities  for the last three years have generally been similar to the trends in our earnings 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased in compared to  and in compared to due to lower capital expenditure requirements in recent years as a result of lower customer demand  as well as the timing of certain assets that have become fully depreciated 
the consolidated statements of cash flows have not been revised for discontinued operations resulting from the sale of our furniture components segment 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements 
changes in assets and liabilities result primarily from the timing of production  sales and purchases 
such changes in assets and liabilities generally tend to even out over time 
however  year to year relative changes in assets and liabilities can significantly affect the comparability of cash flows from operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in the million decrease in cash provided by both continuing and discontinued operating activities is primarily the net result of lower operating income in attributable to continuing operations of approximately million  and lower operating income attributable to discontinued operations of million  higher net cash provided by relative changes in our inventories  receivables  payables and non tax related accruals of million in lower cash paid for income taxes in of approximately million  and lower cash paid for interest in of due to the timing of interest payments discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we expect cash flows from operating activities to result in a net use of cash in due primarily to a cash payment for taxes of approximately million related to the sale of our disposed operations  which will be paid in the first quarter of the year 
under gaap  cash paid for income taxes on the disposal of a business unit is reported as a reduction of cash flows from operating activities  while the pre tax proceeds from disposal are reported as a component of cash flows from investing activities 
in addition  operating cash flow comparisons in will be negatively impacted by such sale  since the operating cash flows of the disposed operations are included in our total cash flows from operating activities in  through the december date of sale 
see note to the consolidated financial statements

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as shown below  our average number of days in inventory did not change from december  to december  the decrease for security products and marine components was the result of inventory reduction efforts across those segments 
the increase for furniture components was due to changes in shipping terms of a north america customer serviced by the taiwanese location 
the terms changed from point of shipment to point of receipt resulting in an increase in in transit inventory 
the variability in days in inventory among our segments primarily relates to the complexity of the production processes and therefore the length of time it takes to produce end products 
as a result  our overall december  days in inventory compared to december  is in line with our expectations

net cash used by investing activities totaled million for the year ended december  capital expenditures have primarily emphasized improving our manufacturing facilities and investing in manufacturing equipment  which utilizes new technologies and increases automation of the manufacturing process to provide for increased productivity and efficiency 
the significant items impacting the increase in net cash provided by investing activities in over net cash provided in and net cash used in are as follows during  we sold our furniture components segment for net proceeds of million less cash of the disposed operations of million  and we received million in net proceeds on the sale of our byron center facility which was previously included in assets held for sale 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements  respectively

in january  we amended and restated the facility to  among other things  decrease the size of the facility to million 
the million outstanding at december  was repaid in the fourth quarter of prior to the completion of the disposal of our furniture components segment  at which time we terminated the credit facility 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements off balance sheet financing arrangements 
other than certain operating leases discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  neither we nor any of our subsidiaries or affiliates are parties to any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
other we believe cash generated from operations together with cash on hand will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service and dividends if declared for the next twelve months and our long term obligations for the next five years 
to the extent that actual operating results or other developments differ from our expectations  our liquidity could be adversely affected 
substantially all of our million aggregate cash and cash equivalents at december   was held in the us we periodically evaluate our liquidity requirements  alternative uses of capital  capital needs and available resources in view of  among other things  our capital expenditure requirements  dividend policy and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  we have in the past and may in the future seek to raise additional capital  refinance or restructure indebtedness  issue additional securities  repurchase shares of our common stock  modify our dividend policy or take a combination of such steps to manage our liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of business  we may review opportunities for acquisitions  joint ventures or other business combinations in the component products industry 
in the event of any such transaction  we may consider using available cash  issuing additional equity securities or increasing our indebtedness or that of our subsidiaries 
contractual obligations 
as more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we are a party to various debt  lease and other agreements that contractually and unconditionally commit us to pay certain amounts in the future 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes such contractual commitments as of december  by the type and date of payment 

table of contents payments due by period total and after in thousands note and interest payable operating leases purchase obligations income taxes fixed asset acquisitions total contractual cash obligations the timing and amount shown for our commitments related to indebtedness  operating leases and fixed asset acquisitions are based upon the contractual payment amount and the contractual payment date for those commitments 
the amounts shown for interest on indebtedness are based upon the december  interest rates on outstanding indebtedness  and assumes such interest rates remain unchanged through the maturity date of the indebtedness 
the timing and amount shown for purchase obligations  which consist of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations primarily commitments to purchase raw materials is also based on the contractual payment amount and the contractual payment date for those commitments

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have based the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations upon our consolidated financial statements 
we prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory reserves  the recoverability of long lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets and the realization of deferred income tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our actual future results might differ from previously estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are applicable to all of our operating segments 
table of contents goodwill our goodwill totaled million at december  we perform a goodwill impairment test annually in the third quarter of each year 
goodwill is also evaluated for impairment at other times whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
all of our goodwill at december  is related to our security products segment  the estimated fair value of this segment is determined using level inputs of a discounted cash flow technique since level or level inputs of market prices are not available 
if the fair value is less than the book value  the goodwill is written down to the estimated fair value 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital  are consistent with our internal projections and operating plans 
however  different assumptions and estimates could result in materially different findings which could result in the recognition of a material goodwill impairment 
no goodwill impairment was deemed to exist as a result of our annual impairment review completed during the third quarter of  as the estimated fair value of our security products segment was substantially in excess of its net carrying 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
long lived assets we assess property and equipment for impairment only when circumstances as specified in asc  property  plant  and equipment indicate an impairment may exist 
our determination is based upon  among other things  our estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long lived asset level inputs and our estimates of the current fair value of the asset 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital  are consistent with our internal projections and operating plans 
as a result of continued losses in the marine components segment  we evaluated the recoverability of the marine components long lived assets during the third quarter of we determined that the undiscounted cash flows exceed the current net asset value and therefore the marine components long lived assets are not impaired 
however  if our future cash flows from operations less capital expenditures were to drop significantly below our current expectations approximately below our expectations for the custom marine reporting unit and below our expectations for the livorsi marine reporting unit  it is reasonably likely we would conclude an impairment was present 
at december   the net asset carrying values of custom marine and livorsi marine were million and million  respectively 
no other long lived assets in our other reporting unit were tested for impairment during because there were no circumstances indicating an impairment might exist 
income taxes we recognize deferred taxes for future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  it is possible that in the future we may change our estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would more likely than not be realized in the future resulting in an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported net income in the period the change in estimate was made 

table of contents we record a reserve for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions of asc topic  income taxes  for tax positions where we believe it is more likely than not our position will not prevail with the applicable tax authorities 
our reserve for uncertain tax positions is nil for each of and accruals we record accruals for environmental  legal and other contingencies and commitments when estimated future expenditures associated with the contingencies become probable  and we can reasonably estimate the amounts of the future expenditures 
however  new information may become available to us  or circumstances such as applicable laws and regulations may change  thereby resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount we are required to accrue for such matters and  therefore  a corresponding decrease or increase of our reported net income in the period of such change 
assets held for sale our assets held for sale at december   consist of a facility in river grove  illinois and land in neenah  wisconsin 
these two properties primarily land  buildings and building improvements were formerly used in our operations 
until the fourth quarter of  a facility in byron center  michigan was also included in assets held for sale 
in september we obtained updated independent appraisals of the byron center and river grove facilities 
based on these appraisals  we recognized write downs in the third quarter of of  on the byron center facility and  on the river grove facility to reduce the carrying value of the assets to their estimated fair value less cost to sell 
the appraisals represent a level input as defined by asc we sold the byron center facility in december for net proceeds of million  which net proceeds were less than the carrying amount of the assets and we therefore recognized a loss on the sale of the facility of approximately  during the fourth quarter of in the fourth quarter of  we entered into an agreement to sell the river grove facility 
the transaction closed during the first quarter of the net proceeds from the sale approximate the carrying value of the assets as of december  the valuation of the river grove facility as of december  is based on a sales contract with a third party which represents a level input as defined by asc the write downs on assets held for sale together with the loss on the sale of the byron center facility as of december  totaled million and are included in corporate operating expense 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and raw materials prices 
interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  primarily related to indebtedness 
at december  and  all of our outstanding indebtedness was comprised of variable rate instruments 
the following table presents principal amounts  interest rates and fair value for our outstanding indebtedness at december  and see note to the consolidated financial statements 
amount indebtedness carrying value fair value interest rate maturity date in thousands december  variable rate indebtedness note payable december  variable rate indebtedness note payable revolving credit facility total all of our debt is at variable interest rates 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical adverse movement in interest rates 
as of december  the analysis indicated that such rate movements would not have a material effect on our financial results from operations or cash flows 
however  actual gains or losses in the future may differ materially from our analysis based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate movement 
raw materials 
we will occasionally enter into short term commodity related raw material supply arrangements to mitigate the impact of future increases in commodity related raw material costs 
we do not have long term supply agreements for our raw material requirements because either we believe the risk of unavailability of those raw materials is low and we believe the downside risk of price volatility to be too great or because long term supply agreements for those materials are generally not available 
we do not engage in commodity raw material hedging programs 
other 
the above discussion includes forward looking statements of market risk which assumes hypothetical changes in market prices 
actual future market conditions will likely differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  such forward looking statements should not be considered to be our projections of future events  gains or losses 
such forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties some of which are listed in business general
