the interest rate on the hep credit agreement debt was at december  critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical to understanding the judgments that are involved and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
for additional information  see note description of business and summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of content in the first quarter of  we changed our policy of reporting certain same party accounts receivable and payable amounts in the consolidated balance sheets to reflect a net amount due under contractual netting agreements 
prior to this change  we reported such amounts on a gross basis with a same party receivable and payable balance presented separately in our balance sheet 
gaap permits a reporting entity to elect a policy of offsetting same party receivables and payables when such amounts are net settled under legally enforceable contractual setoff provisions 
we believe that a net presentation is preferable because it more appropriately presents our economic resources accounts receivable and claims against us accounts payable and the future cash flows associated with such assets and liabilities 
additionally  we believe a net presentation of such amounts conforms to the predominant practices used by others in our industry 
we have applied this change in accounting principle on a retrospective basis and have recast our prior period financial statements 
see note change in accounting policy in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of line items affected in our financial statements 
variable interest entity hep is a vie as defined under gaap 
a vie is a legal entity whose equity owners do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or  as a group  the equity holders lack the power  through voting rights  to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity financial performance  the obligation to absorb the entity expected losses or rights to expected residual returns 
as the general partner of hep  we have the sole ability to direct the activities of hep that most significantly impact hep economic performance 
additionally  since our obligation to absorb losses and receive benefits from hep are significant to hep  we are hep primary beneficiary and therefore we consolidate hep 
derivative instruments we have commodity price swap  interest rate swap  physical and nymex futures contracts that are measured at fair value and recognized as other assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
changes in fair value to derivative instruments are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria is met 
derivatives meeting certain hedge accounting criteria are designated as accounting hedges and changes in fair value are recorded directly to other comprehensive income 
these gains or losses are reclassified to earnings as the hedging instruments mature 
also  on a quarterly basis  hedge ineffectiveness on our accounting hedges is measured by comparing the change in fair value of the derivative contracts against the expected future cash inflows outflows on the respective transaction being hedged 
any hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings 
see note derivative instruments and hedging activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation our crude oil and refined product inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the lifo inventory valuation methodology and market is determined using current estimated selling prices 
under the lifo method  the most recently incurred costs are charged to cost of sales and inventories are valued at the earliest acquisition costs 
in periods of rapidly declining prices  lifo inventories may have to be written down to market value due to the higher costs assigned to lifo layers in prior periods 
in addition  the use of the lifo inventory method may result in increases or decreases to cost of sales in years when inventory volumes decline and result in charging cost of sales with lifo inventory costs generated in prior periods 
as of december   many of our lifo inventory layers were valued at historical costs that were established in years when price levels were generally lower  therefore  our results of operation are less sensitive to current market price reductions 
as of december   the excess of current cost over the lifo inventory value of our crude oil and refined product inventories was million 
an actual valuation of inventory under the lifo method is made at the end of each year based on the inventory levels at that time 
accordingly  interim lifo calculations are based on management estimates of expected year end inventory levels and are subject to the final year end lifo inventory valuation 
deferred maintenance costs our refinery units require regular major maintenance and repairs that are commonly referred to as turnarounds 
catalysts used in certain refinery processes also require routine change outs 
the required frequency of the maintenance varies by unit and by catalyst  but generally is every two to five years 
in order to minimize downtime during turnarounds  we often utilize contract labor as well as our maintenance personnel on a continuous hour basis 
whenever possible  turnarounds are scheduled so that some units continue to operate while others are down for maintenance 
we record the costs of turnarounds as deferred charges and amortize the deferred costs over the expected periods of benefit 

table of content long lived assets we calculate depreciation and amortization based on estimated useful lives and salvage values of our assets 
when assets are placed into service  we make estimates with respect to their useful lives that we believe are reasonable 
however  factors such as competition  regulation or environmental matters could cause us to change our estimates  thus impacting the future calculation of depreciation and amortization 
we evaluate long lived assets for potential impairment by identifying whether indicators of impairment exist and  if so  assessing whether the long lived assets are recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
the actual amount of impairment loss  if any  to be recorded is equal to the amount by which a long lived asset carrying value exceeds its fair value  which is generally determined under an income approach using forecasted cash flows associated with the underlying asset 
estimates of future cash flows require subjective assumptions with regard to future operating results and actual results could differ from those estimates 
no impairments of long lived assets were recorded during the years ended december   and intangibles and goodwill intangible assets are assets other than financial assets that lack physical substance 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
goodwill acquired in a business combination and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized while intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on a straight line basis 
goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired 
our analysis entails a comparison of the estimated fair value of these assets that are derived using a combination of both income discounted future expected net cash flows and comparable market approaches against their respective carrying values 
estimates of future cash flows and fair value of assets require subjective assumptions with regard to future operating results and actual results could differ from those estimates 
there were no impairments of intangible assets or goodwill during the years ended december   and contingencies we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to environmental  labor  product and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
risk management we use certain strategies to reduce some commodity price and operational risks 
we do not attempt to eliminate all market risk exposures when we believe that the exposure relating to such risk would not be significant to our future earnings  financial position  capital resources or liquidity or that the cost of eliminating the exposure would outweigh the benefit 
commodity price risk management our primary market risk is commodity price risk 
we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in crude oil and refined products  as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in our refining operations 
we periodically enter into derivative contracts in the form of commodity price swaps and futures contracts to mitigate price exposure with respect to our inventory positions  natural gas purchases  costs of crude oil and related grade differentials  prices of refined products  and our refining margins 

table of content as of december   we have the following notional contract volumes related to all outstanding derivative contracts used to mitigate commodity price risk notional contract volumes by year of maturity contract description total outstanding notional unit of measure natural gas price swap long mmbtu wti price swap long barrels ultra low sulfur diesel price swap short barrels unleaded gasoline price swap short barrels wcs price swap long barrels wti price swap short barrels nymex futures wti long barrels nymex futures wti short barrels physical contracts long barrels physical contracts short barrels the following sensitivity analysis provides the hypothetical effects of market price fluctuations to the commodity positions hedged under our derivative contracts derivative fair value gain loss at december  change in underlying commodity prices of hedged positions in thousands increase in underlying commodity prices decrease in underlying commodity prices interest rate risk management hep uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate risk 
as of december   hep had three interest rate swap contracts that hedge its exposure to the cash flow risk caused by the effects of libor changes on million in credit agreement advances 
the first interest rate swap effectively converts million of libor based debt to fixed rate debt having an interest rate of plus an applicable margin of as of december   which equaled an effective interest rate of 
this swap matures in february hep has two additional interest rate swaps with identical terms which effectively convert million of libor based debt to fixed rate debt having an interest rate of plus an applicable margin of as of december   which equaled an effective interest rate of 
both of these swap contracts mature in july these swap contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges 
the market risk inherent in our fixed rate debt and positions is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in interest rates as discussed below 
for the fixed rate hollyfrontier senior notes and hep senior notes  changes in interest rates will generally affect fair value of the debt  but not our earnings or cash flows 
the outstanding principal  estimated fair value and estimated change in fair value assuming a hypothetical change in the yield to maturity rates for these debt instruments as of december  is presented below outstanding principal estimated fair value estimated change in fair value in thousands hollyfrontier senior notes hep senior notes 
table of content for the variable rate hep credit agreement  changes in interest rates would affect cash flows  but not the fair value 
at december   outstanding borrowings under the hep credit agreement were million 
by means of its cash flow hedges  hep has effectively converted the variable rate on million of outstanding principal to a weighted average fixed rate of 
at december   our marketable securities included investments in investment grade  highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase and hence the interest rate market risk implicit in these cash investments is low 
due to the short term nature of our cash and cash equivalents  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
since we have the ability to liquidate this portfolio  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio 
our operations are subject to hazards of petroleum processing operations  including fire  explosion and weather related perils 
we maintain various insurance coverages  including business interruption insurance  subject to certain deductibles 
we are not fully insured against certain risks because such risks are not fully insurable  coverage is unavailable  or premium costs  in our judgment  do not justify such expenditures 
financial information is reviewed on the counterparties in order to review and monitor their financial stability and assess their ongoing ability to honor their commitments under the derivative contracts 
we have not experienced  nor do we expect to experience  any difficulty in the counterparties honoring their commitments 
we have a risk management oversight committee consisting of members from our senior management 
this committee oversees our risk enterprise program  monitors our risk environment and provides direction for activities to mitigate identified risks that may adversely affect the achievement of our goals

reconciliations to amounts reported under generally accepted accounting principles reconciliations of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda to amounts reported under generally accepted accounting principles in financial statements 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  which we refer to as ebitda  is calculated as net income attributable to hollyfrontier stockholders plus i interest expense  net of interest income  ii income tax provision  and iii depreciation and amortization 
ebitda is not a calculation provided for under gaap  however  the amounts included in the ebitda calculation are derived from amounts included in our consolidated financial statements 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income or operating income as an indication of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
ebitda is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
ebitda is presented here because it is a widely used financial indicator used by investors and analysts to measure performance 
ebitda is also used by our management for internal analysis and as a basis for financial covenants 
set forth below is our calculation of ebitda

table of content reconciliations of refinery operating information non gaap performance measures to amounts reported under generally accepted accounting principles in financial statements 
refinery gross margin and net operating margin are non gaap performance measures that are used by our management and others to compare our refining performance to that of other companies in our industry 
we believe these margin measures are helpful to investors in evaluating our refining performance on a relative and absolute basis 
refinery gross margin per barrel is the difference between average net sales price and average cost of products per barrel of produced refined products 
net operating margin per barrel is the difference between refinery gross margin and refinery operating expenses per barrel of produced refined products 
these two margins do not include the effect of depreciation and amortization 
each of these component performance measures can be reconciled directly to our consolidated statements of income 
other companies in our industry may not calculate these performance measures in the same manner 
refinery gross and net operating margins below are reconciliations to our consolidated statements of income for i net sales  cost of products and operating expenses  in each case averaged per produced barrel sold  and ii net operating margin and refinery gross margin 
due to rounding of reported numbers  some amounts may not calculate exactly
