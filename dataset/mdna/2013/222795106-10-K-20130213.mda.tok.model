item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes 
overview of performance and company and industry trends the company made progress in with executing its strategy of producing returns through the acquisition  development and management of trophy office and retail assets in the sunbelt with particular focus on georgia  texas and north carolina 
in implementing this strategy  the company had goals for that included simplifying its business through the sale of non core assets  leasing vacant space and investing in opportunistic acquisitions and development projects within its core markets 
the 
table of contents company was successful in meeting these goals and management believes that the company is appropriately positioned for the future 
sale of non core assets during  the company sold million in non core assets 
this amount included the sale of three retail lifestyle centers  two of which were in atlanta  georgia and one of which was in memphis  tennessee 
the company also sold its interests in five office properties 
two of these office properties were purchased initially for their location and land value for which development opportunities never materialized 
three of these office properties were sold out of joint ventures for strategic reasons or pursuant to buy out provisions within the joint venture agreements 
the company also sold the majority of its interests in cl realty llc and temco associates  two joint ventures formed for residential lot and land development  to its partner 
the company reduced its holdings of commercial land as well by selling acres in in addition to these real estate asset sales  the company sold its third party management and leasing business 
the results of the sales activities are significant 
the percentage of net operating income generated by retail projects decreased from for the fourth quarter of to for the fourth quarter of square footage of properties owned and operated in georgia decreased from million as of december  to million as of december  the remaining office assets in georgia are primarily held in three strategic submarkets buckhead  midtown and downtown  while most of the remaining retail assets in georgia are owned in joint ventures in which the company owns only a small interest 
in addition  the company decreased the its share of the carrying amount of commercial and residential land from million at december  to million at december  and land as a percentage of the company total assets decreased from as of december  to as of december  these non core asset sales also allowed the company to end with no amount outstanding under its unsecured credit facility and with million of cash on its balance sheet 
while dilutive in the short term  this financial position provides the company with significant capacity to invest in the company core markets 
the company has also exited the residential lot development business  the third party management and leasing business  the condominium development business and the industrial development business  thereby  allowing the company to eliminate the costs associated with managing and operating these operations and allowing management to focus its efforts on the company core businesses 
leasing activity in  the company leased or renewed  square feet of office space 
as a result of this activity  the same property office portfolio increased from leased at december  to leased at december  this improvement is attributable primarily to activity at peachtree where  square feet of net new leasing has taken this building from leased at the beginning of the year to leased at year end 
also  outside of the same property portfolio  promenade  which was acquired in the fourth quarter of  improved from leased at the beginning of the year to leased at year end 
the company retail portfolio also improved during the year as the company leased or renewed  square feet of retail space 
the same property retail portfolio increased from leased at the beginning of the year to leased at year end 
this increase was driven by leasing activity at the avenue forsyth  which sold in the fourth quarter 
the company increased percentage leased at the avenue forsyth from at the beginning of the year to at the time of sale  which resulted in a more favorable valuation of this asset upon sale 
some of this square footage leased also occurred at tiffany springs marketcenter  where the leasing percentage increased from to during the year 
the long term prospects for the company markets remain strong 
each of the company markets is projecting job growth over the next five years higher than the national average with the texas markets projected to be the strongest 
current unemployment in the atlanta and charlotte markets is higher than the national average  but all other markets are lower than the nation overall 
office absorption was positive in each market with houston being the strongest 
rental rates have been stable over the past year within the company portfolio  the highest net rents are in austin and the lowest are in the north fulton sub market of atlanta 
with respect to retail  overall black friday sales trends were positive  showing a increase in spending 
consumer confidence reached a four and a half year high in november 
comparable same store sales at the company retail properties were up for the year  which is consistent with national trends 
while the company retail portfolio is smaller than at the beginning of  management believes there is positive momentum for maintaining and increasing revenues from these remaining properties 
opportunistic investments the company investment strategy is to purchase trophy office assets or locate opportunistic development or re development properties in its core markets to which it can add value through relationships  capital or market expertise 
during  the company 
table of contents purchased one well located property in dallas  texas with upside potential  completed two development projects and created a future development pipeline 
after year end  the company added a trophy property in houston  texas to its portfolio 
in the third quarter of  the company purchased ross avenue  an  square foot  class a office building in the arts district of dallas  texas 
the company purchased this property for per square foot which represents an amount that is below management estimate of replacement cost 
the property was acquired at a price that provides an attractive immediate return on investment  and at leased  provides the opportunity for the company to increase its returns as vacant space is leased 
in the second half of  the company began operations at emory point  a mixed use development adjacent to emory university and the centers for disease control in atlanta  georgia 
the project contains  square feet of retail and apartment units 
the retail portion was leased and the apartment portion was leased at year end 
the company is in the pre development stage for a second phase of emory point 
the company also began operations at mahan village  a  square foot shopping center anchored by publix and academy sports in tallahassee  florida 
this property was leased at year end 
this opportunity was sourced through a relationship where the company stepped into the place of the original developer 
with the opening of mahan village  the company retail portfolio now contains five publix anchored shopping centers 
subsequent to year end  the company consummated a series of transactions that resulted in the purchase of a trophy asset in the galleria submarket of houston  texas  and the contribution of its interests in the assets at its terminus project into a joint venture 
the company first purchased the interest of its joint venture partner in terminus  then contributed terminus and terminus to the new joint venture with jp morgan 
in addition  the company purchased post oak central  a million square foot class a office complex in houston  from an affiliate of jp morgan 
post oak central was leased upon closing of the transaction and provides the company with a high quality asset with significant redevelopment potential in a desirable houston sub market  thereby increasing the company exposure to the texas market 
in addition to a second phase of emory point  the company has another potential development that it hopes to commence in third and colorado is a proposed office building in downtown austin  texas 
the company is in the pre leasing stage 
if this project moves forward  the company estimates total project costs will be approximately million 
going forward  the company expects to continue selling land and other non core assets in order to further simplify its business platform 
leasing of vacant space represents a significant opportunity to improve results of operations and enhance the value of the company real estate holdings and is an important focus for the company also plans to source new development and acquisition projects that it expects to enhance value to shareholders over time 
with the capital generated from the sales activities in  management believes that the company is well positioned to implement its strategy 
critical accounting policies the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap as outlined in the financial accounting standards board s accounting standards codification  and the notes to consolidated financial statements include a summary of the significant accounting policies for the company 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the use of certain estimates  a change in which could materially affect revenues  expenses  assets or liabilities 
some of the company s accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies  which are ones that are both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations  and ones that also require significant judgment or complex estimation processes 
the company s critical accounting policies are as follows real estate assets cost capitalization 
the company is involved in all stages of real estate ownership  including development 
prior to the point a project becomes probable of being developed defined as more likely than not  the company expenses predevelopment costs 
after management determines the project is probable  all subsequently incurred predevelopment costs  as well as interest  real estate taxes and certain internal personnel and associated costs directly related to the project under development  are capitalized in accordance with accounting rules 
if the company abandons development of a project that had earlier been deemed probable  the company charges all previously capitalized costs to expense 
if this occurs  the company s predevelopment expenses could rise significantly 
the determination of whether a project is probable requires judgment by management 
if management determines that a project is probable  interest  general and administrative and other expenses could be materially different than if management determines the project is not probable 
during the predevelopment period of a probable project and the period in which a project is under construction  the company capitalizes all direct and indirect costs associated with planning  developing  leasing and constructing the project 
determination of what costs constitute direct and indirect project costs requires management  in some cases  to exercise judgment 
if management 
table of contents determines certain costs to be direct or indirect project costs  amounts recorded in projects under development on the balance sheet and amounts recorded in general and administrative and other expenses on the statements of comprehensive income could be materially different than if management determines these costs are not directly or indirectly associated with the project 
once a project is constructed and deemed substantially complete and held for occupancy  carrying costs  such as real estate taxes  interest  internal personnel and associated costs  are expensed as incurred 
determination of when construction of a project is substantially complete and held available for occupancy requires judgment 
the company considers projects and or project phases to be both substantially complete and held for occupancy at the earlier of the date on which the project or phase reached economic occupancy of or one year after it is substantially complete 
the company s judgment of the date the project is substantially complete has a direct impact on the company s operating expenses and net income for the period 
operating property acquisitions 
upon acquisition of an operating property  the company records the acquired tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities at fair value at the acquisition date 
fair value is based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize available market information and discount and or capitalization rates as appropriate 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results  known and anticipated trends  and market and economic conditions 
the acquired assets and assumed liabilities for an acquired operating property generally include  but are not limited to land  buildings and identified tangible and intangible assets and liabilities associated with in place leases  including tenant improvements  leasing costs  value of above market and below market leases and value of acquired in place lease 
the fair value of land is derived from comparable sales of land within the same submarket and or region 
the fair value of buildings  tenant improvements and leasing costs are based upon current market replacement costs and other relevant market rate information 
the fair value of the above market or below market component of an acquired in place lease is based upon the present value calculated using a market discount rate of the difference between i the contractual rents to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and ii management s estimate of the rents that would be paid using fair market rental rates and rent escalations at the date of acquisition over the remaining term of the lease 
in place leases at acquired properties are reviewed at the time of acquisition to determine if contractual rents are above or below current market rents for the acquired property  and an identifiable intangible asset or liability is recorded if there is an above market or below market lease 
the fair value of acquired in place leases is derived based on management s assessment of lost revenue and costs incurred for the period required to lease the assumed vacant property to the occupancy level when purchased 
this fair value is based on a variety of considerations including  but not necessarily limited to the value associated with avoiding the cost of originating the acquired in place leases  the value associated with lost revenue related to tenant reimbursable operating costs estimated to be incurred during the assumed lease up period  and the value associated with lost rental revenue from existing leases during the assumed lease up period 
factors considered in performing these analyses include an estimate of the carrying costs during the expected lease up periods  such as real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses  current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases  such as leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses 
the amounts recorded for above market and in place leases are included in other assets on the balance sheets  and the amounts for below market leases are included in other liabilities on the balance sheets 
these amounts are amortized on a straight line basis as an adjustment to rental income over the remaining term of the applicable leases 
the determination of the fair value of the acquired tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities of operating property acquisitions requires significant judgments and assumptions about the numerous inputs discussed above 
the use of different assumptions in these fair value calculations could significantly affect the reported amounts of the allocation of the acquisition related assets and liabilities and the related amortization and depreciation expense recorded for such assets and liabilities 
in addition  since the value of above market and below market leases are amortized as either a reduction or increase to rental income  respectively  the judgments for these intangibles could have a significant impact on reported rental revenues and results of operations 
depreciation and amortization 
the company depreciates or amortizes operating real estate assets over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method of depreciation 
management uses judgment when estimating the life of real estate assets and when allocating certain indirect project costs to projects under development 
historical data  comparable properties and replacement costs are some of the factors considered in determining useful lives and cost allocations 
the use of different assumptions for the estimated useful life of assets or cost allocations could significantly affect depreciation and amortization expense and the carrying amount of the company real estate assets 
impairment 
management reviews its real estate assets on a property by property basis for impairment 
this review includes the company s operating properties and the company s land holdings 

table of contents the first step in this process is for management to use judgment to determine whether an asset is considered to be held and used or held for sale  in accordance with accounting guidance 
in order to be considered a real estate asset held for sale  management must  among other things  have the authority to commit to a plan to sell the asset in its current condition  have commenced the plan to sell the asset and have determined that it is probable that the asset will sell within one year 
if management determines that an asset is held for sale  it must record an impairment loss if the fair value less costs to sell is less than the carrying amount 
all real estate assets not meeting the held for sale criteria are considered to be held and used 
in the impairment analysis for assets held and used  management must use judgment to determine whether there are indicators of impairment 
for operating properties  these indicators could include a decline in a property s leasing percentage  a current period operating loss or negative cash flows combined with a history of losses at the property  a decline on lease rates for that property or others in the property s market  or an adverse change in the financial condition of significant tenants 
for land holdings  indicators could include an overall decline in the market value of land in the region  a decline in development activity for the intended use of the land or other adverse economic and market conditions 
if management determines that an asset that is held and used has indicators of impairment  it must determine whether the undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset exceed the carrying amount of the asset 
if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  the company must reduce the carrying amount of the asset to fair value 
in calculating the undiscounted net cash flows of an asset  management must estimate a number of inputs 
for operating properties  management must estimate future rental rates  expenditures for future leases  future operating expenses and market capitalization rates for residual values  among other things 
for land holdings  management must estimate future sales prices as well as operating income  carrying costs and residual capitalization rates for land held for future development 
in addition  if there are alternative strategies for the future use of the asset  management must assess the probability of each alternative strategy and perform a probability weighted undiscounted cash flow analysis to assess the recoverability of the asset 
management must use considerable judgment in determining the alternative strategies and in assessing the probability of each strategy selected 
in determining the fair value of an asset  management exercises judgment on a number of factors 
management may determine fair value by using a discounted cash flow calculation or by utilizing comparable market information 
management must determine an appropriate discount rate to apply to the cash flows in the discounted cash flow calculation 
management must use judgment in analyzing comparable market information because no two real estate assets are identical in location and price 
the estimates and judgments used in the impairment process are highly subjective and susceptible to frequent change 
if management determines that an asset is held and used  the results of operations could be materially different than if it determines that an asset is held for sale 
different assumptions management uses in the calculation of undiscounted net cash flows of a project  including the assumptions associated with alternative strategies and the probabilities associated with alternative strategies  could cause a material impairment loss to be recognized when no impairment is otherwise warranted 
management s assumptions about the discount rate used in a discounted cash flow estimate of fair value and management s judgment with respect to market information could materially affect the decision to record impairment losses or  if required  the amount of the impairment losses 
recoveries from tenants recoveries from tenants for operating expenses are determined on a calendar year and on a lease by lease basis 
the most common types of cost reimbursements in our leases are common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  for which the tenant pays its pro rata share in excess of a base year amount  if applicable 
the computation of these amounts is complex and involves numerous judgments  including the interpretation of terms and other customer lease provisions 
leases are not uniform in dealing with such cost reimbursements and there are many variations in the computation 
many tenants make monthly fixed payments of these operating expenses 
we accrue income related to these payments each month 
we make monthly accrual adjustments  positive or negative  to recorded amounts to our best estimate of the annual amounts to be billed and collected with respect to the cost reimbursements 
after the end of the calendar year  we compute each customer final cost reimbursements and  after considering amounts paid by the tenant during the year  issue a bill or credit for the appropriate amount to the tenant 
the differences between the amounts billed less previously received payments and the accrual adjustments are recorded as increases or decreases to revenues when the final bills are prepared  which occurs during the first half of the subsequent year 
revenue recognition valuation of receivables notes and accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
the company reviews its receivables regularly for potential collection problems in computing the allowance to record against its receivables 
this review requires management to make certain judgments regarding collectibility  notwithstanding the fact that ultimate collections are inherently difficult to predict 
economic conditions fluctuate over time  and the company has tenants in many different industries which experience changes in economic health  making collectibility prediction difficult 
therefore  certain receivables currently deemed collectible could become uncollectible  and those reserved could ultimately be collected 
a 
table of contents change in judgments made could result in an adjustment to the allowance for doubtful accounts with a corresponding effect on net income 
income taxes valuation allowance the company establishes a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
the realization of a deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under tax law 
the company periodically assesses the need for valuation allowances for deferred tax assets based on the more likely than not realization threshold criterion 
in the assessment  appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets 
this assessment requires considerable judgment by management and includes  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carryforward periods  its experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and tax planning alternatives 
if management determines that the company requires a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets  income tax expense or benefit could be materially different than if management determines no such valuation allowance is necessary 
investment in joint ventures the company holds ownership interests in a number of joint ventures with varying structures 
management evaluates all of its joint ventures and other variable interests to determine if the entity is a variable interest entity vie  as defined in accounting rules 
if the venture is a vie  and if management determines that the company is the primary beneficiary  the company consolidates the assets  liabilities and results of operations of the vie 
the company quarterly reassesses its conclusions as to whether the entity is a vie and whether consolidation is appropriate as required under the rules 
for entities that are not determined to be vies  management evaluates whether or not the company has control or significant influence over the joint venture to determine the appropriate consolidation and presentation 
generally  entities under the company s control are consolidated  and entities over which the company can exert significant influence  but does not control  are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
management uses judgment to determine whether an entity is a vie  whether the company is the primary beneficiary of the vie and whether the company exercises control over the entity 
if management determines that an entity is a vie with the company as primary beneficiary or if management concludes that the company exercises control over the entity  the balance sheets and statements of comprehensive income would be significantly different than if management concludes otherwise 
in addition  vies require different disclosures in the notes to the financial statements than entities that are not vies 
management may also change its conclusions and  thereby  change its balance sheets  statements of comprehensive income and notes to the financial statements  based on facts and circumstances that arise after the original consolidation determination is made 
these changes could include additional equity contributed to entities  changes in the allocation of cash flow to entity partners and changes in the expected results within the entity 
management performs an impairment analysis of the recoverability of its investments in joint ventures on a quarterly basis 
as part of this analysis  management first determines whether there are any indicators of impairment in any joint venture investment 
if indicators of impairment are present for any of the company s investments in joint ventures  management calculates the fair value of the investment 
if the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment  management must determine whether the impairment is temporary or other than temporary  as defined by gaap 
if management assesses the impairment to be temporary  the company does not record an impairment charge 
if management concludes that the impairment is other than temporary  the company records an impairment charge 
management uses considerable judgment in the determination of whether there are indicators of impairment present and in the assumptions  estimations and inputs used in calculating the fair value of the investment 
these judgments are similar to those outlined above in the impairment of real estate assets 
management also uses judgment in making the determination as to whether the impairment is temporary or other than temporary 
the company utilizes guidance provided by the sec in making the determination of whether the impairment is temporary 
the guidance indicates that companies consider the length of time that the impairment has existed  the financial condition of the joint venture and the ability and intent of the holder to retain the investment long enough for a recovery in market value 
management s judgment as to the fair value of the investment or on the conclusion of the nature of the impairment could have a material impact on the results of operations and financial condition of the company 
discussion of new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued new guidance related to the presentation of other comprehensive income oci 
the new guidance requires  among other items  the presentation of the components of net income and oci in one continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in  the company reclassified oci from the statements of equity to the statements of comprehensive income 
as the requirement pertains to presentation and disclosure only  adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on results of operations or financial condition 
results of operations for the three years ended december  
table of contents general the company financial results have historically been significantly affected by purchase and sale transactions 
accordingly  the company historical financial statements may not be indicative of future operating results 
rental property revenues rental property revenues increased million between and as a result of the following increase of million as a result of the promenade acquisition in increase of million as a result of the ross acquisition  increase of million at peachtree tower as a result of an increase in average economic occupancy  increase of  at university as a result of an increase in average economic occupancy  increase of  at mahan village as a result of the commencement of operations  decrease of million at north point as a result of the termination of a lease in the vacated space has been re leased to a tenant whose lease commenced in the fourth quarter of  decrease of  at american cancer society center acs center as a result of a decrease in average economic occupancy  and decrease of  at terminus as a result of lower recoverable expense revenues and a slight decrease in average economic occupancy

rental property operating expenses increased million between and primarily as a result of the promenade acquisition 
fee income fee income increased approximately million between and this increase is primarily due to the receipt of a million participation interest related to a contract that the company assumed in the acquisition of an entity several years ago 
under this contract  the company is entitled to receive a portion of the proceeds from the sale of a project that the entity developed and from payments received from a related seller financed note 
the company may receive additional proceeds under this contract in future periods 
partially offsetting this amount were lower leasing fees earned in from msref terminus llc msref t and ten peachtree place associates  which was sold in fee income decreased  between and this decrease is primarily the result of a decrease in leasing fees from palisades west llc and msref t as a result of these properties no longer being in the lease up stage and  therefore  signing fewer leases 
multi family residential sales and cost of sales 
table of contents multi family residential unit sales and cost of sales decreased significantly in both and the company has been liquidating its holdings of unsold multi family units over the past three years and has commenced no new multi family residential development projects during that time

impairment losses during  the company incurred an impairment loss of  on its investment in verde realty verde  a cost method investment in a non public real estate investment trust  as a result of a merger of verde into another company at a price per share less than the company carrying amount 
during  management began a strategic review and analysis of its residential and land businesses  as well as certain of its operating properties  in an attempt to determine the most effective way to maximize the value of its holdings 
in february  the company determined that it would liquidate its holdings of certain non core assets in bulk on a more accelerated timeline and at lower prices than initially planned and re deploy this capital  primarily into office properties within its core markets 
as part of this process  in the fourth quarter of  the company revised the cash flow projections for its residential holdings as well as two operating properties that were being held for long term investment opportunities 
the cash flow revisions reflected a higher probability that the company would sell the assets in the short term than holding them for long term investment and development opportunities 
these cash flow revisions indicated that the undiscounted cash flows of residential and land projects  as well as two operating properties  were less than their carrying amounts  and the company recorded impairment losses of million to adjust these carrying amounts to fair value 
the company reclassified million of these amounts to discontinued operations in earlier in  the company recorded an other than temporary impairment loss of million on its investment in verde to adjust the carrying amount of the company investment to fair value  as a result of an analysis performed in connection with verde withdrawal of its proposed public offering 
during  the company recorded an impairment loss of million on handy road  an encumbered  undeveloped parcel of land in suburban atlanta  georgia that the company was holding for future development or sale  because the company determined that it would convey the land to the lending bank through foreclosure 
in addition  in  the company recorded an impairment loss of  on north market  a multi family residential project in asheville  north carolina  because it determined the estimated selling prices of the units had declined since its acquisition 

table of contents most of the company real estate assets are considered to be held for use pursuant to the accounting rules 
if management strategy changes on any of these assets  the company may be required to record significant impairment charges in future periods 
changes that could cause these impairment losses include a decision by the company to sell the asset rather than hold for long term investment or development purposes  or changes in management estimates of future cash flows from the assets that cause the future undiscounted cash flows to be less than the asset carrying amount 
given the uncertainties with the economic environment  management cannot predict whether or not the company will incur impairment losses in the future  and if impairment losses are recorded  management cannot predict the magnitude of such losses 
loss on extinguishment of debt and interest rate swaps in  the company amended and restated its credit facility and as a result  charged  of unamortized loan costs to expense 
in  the company prepaid the lakeshore park plaza mortgage note and as a result  charged  of unamortized loan costs to expense 
in  the company incurred a fee of million to terminate an interest rate swap on a term loan 
in addition  in  the company restructured its credit facility and as a result  charged  in unamortized loan costs to expense 
income loss from unconsolidated joint ventures in  and  the company had a considerable amount of activity that affected income loss from unconsolidated joint ventures 
in  the company sold its interest in palisades west llc for million and recognized a gain from unconsolidated entities of million associated with this sale 
in addition  ten peachtree place associates sold the ten peachtree place building to a third party 
the company received proceeds from this sale of million and recognized a gain from unconsolidated joint ventures of million associated with this sale 
cp venture two llc sold presbyterian medical plaza to a third party in and the company received proceeds from the sale of  and recognized a gain of  associated with this sale 
in addition  in  the emory point development project became operational within ep i llc and the company recorded  in its share of the losses from the start up operations 
in  temco associates temco and cl realty  llc cl realty recorded impairment losses in income from unconsolidated joint ventures on assets held by each entity 
during  temco and cl realty updated cash flow projections for its projects and determined the cash flows to be generated by certain projects were less than their carrying amounts 
consequently  temco and cl realty recorded impairment losses to record these assets at fair value  the company share of which was million for temco and million for cl realty 
in the first quarter of  forestar realty inc  the company partner in each venture  purchased the majority of the ventures residential project and land acreage 
the company share of the proceeds from this transaction was million and neither venture recognized a significant gain or loss on the transaction since the purchase price approximated the carrying amounts of the assets sold
