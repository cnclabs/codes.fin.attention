general we operate in three distinct business segments a ferrous and non ferrous scrap metal recycling scrap metal recycling  b platinum group and minor metals recycling pgm and minor metals recycling  and c lead metal product fabricating lead fabricating 
as of the date of this filing  our operating facilities include twenty four scrap metal recycling facilities  including a combined aluminum de oxidizing plant  five pgm and minor metal recycling facilities and four lead product manufacturing and fabricating plants 
the company markets a majority of its products domestically but maintains several international customers 
the pgm and minor metals recycling segment includes five facilities located in buda  texas  gulfport  mississippi  lancaster and west chester  pennsylvania and elizabeth  new jersey 
the lead fabricating segment includes four lead fabrication and recycling plants located in birmingham  alabama  healdsburg and ontario  california and granite city  illinois 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies 
we rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
areas that require significant judgments  estimates  and assumptions include accounting for revenues  accounts receivable and allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable  inventory  put warrants liability  derivatives and hedging activities  environmental and litigation matters  the testing of goodwill and other intangible assets  stock based compensation  and income taxes 
management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments  estimates  and assumptions  and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the company s consolidated financial statements at any given time 
despite these inherent limitations  management believes that management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 
the critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this filing 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized as goods are shipped  which generally is when title transfers and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to customers  based on free on board fob terms 
brokerage sales are recognized upon receipt of materials by the customer and reported net of costs in product sales 
historically  there have been few sales returns and adjustments in excess of reserves for such instances that would impact the ultimate collection of revenues  therefore  no material provisions have been made when a sale is recognized 

table of contents accounts receivable and allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable accounts receivable consists primarily of amounts due from customers from product sales 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable totaled  and  as of december  and  respectively 
our determination of the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable includes a number of factors  including the age of the accounts  past experience with the accounts  changes in collection patterns and general industry conditions 
derivatives and hedging we are exposed to certain risks relating to our ongoing business operations 
the primary risks currently managed by using derivative instruments are commodity price risk 
we use forward sales contracts with pgm substrate processors to protect against volatile commodity prices 
this process ensures a fixed selling price for the material we purchase and process 
we secure selling prices with pgm processors  in ounces of platinum  palladium and rhodium  in incremental lots for material which we expect to purchase within an average to day time period 
however  these forward sales contracts with pgm substrate processors are not subject to any hedge designation as they are considered within the normal sales exemption provided by asc topic we have in the past entered into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk associated with our variable rate borrowings 
in connection with the credit agreement entered into on march   with jpm chase bank  na  the company was required to terminate the million interest rate swap contract 
as a result  the company paid  to terminate the interest rate swap contract 
with the termination of the interest rate swap contract  no other interest rate swap agreement is outstanding 
goodwill the carrying amount of goodwill is tested annually as of december and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
judgment is used in assessing whether goodwill should be tested more frequently for impairment than annually 
factors such as unexpected adverse economic conditions  competition and other external events may require more frequent assessments 
we assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
the goodwill impairment test follows a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment 
in the second step  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value 
this allocation is similar to a purchase price allocation 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
at september   we identified competitive pressures in sourcing pgm catalysts  its affect on gross margins and expectations of future cash flows  particularly in the texas market  and determined that these negative factors were significant enough to perform an interim impairment test for these reporting units 
based on our assessment of future operating results for these reporting units  we calculated their respective fair values using a discounted cash flow analyses and had determined that the fair value of these reporting units was less than their respective carrying values and we recorded goodwill impairment charges of million and million to our texas and new jersey pgm recycling units  respectively  at september  at december   we performed our annual impairment test 
we determined that when we discounted the expected future cash flows of our ohio and pittsburgh scrap metal recycling reporting units it resulted in fair values that did not exceed their respective carrying values 
this resulted in goodwill impairment charges of million for our ohio reporting unit and million for our pittsburgh scrap metal reporting unit 
in  we entered into a joint venture agreement to co operate a scrap recycling facility in ithaca  new york that expires on april  the joint venture s operation had been supported by  and was 
table of contents included in  our new york state scrap recycling reporting unit 
the absence of future cash flows from the joint venture and discontinued support from our other new york facilities resulted in an additional goodwill write down of  for the year ended december  as of december   the company has identified six reporting units with recorded goodwill 
a list of the company s reporting units and the amount of goodwill remaining in each reporting unit as of december   is as follows in thousands reporting unit goodwill recorded lead fabricating new york state scrap recycling ohio scrap recycling bradford  pa scrap recycling minor metals recycling new jersey pgm recycling total in determining the carrying value of each reporting unit  where appropriate  management allocates net deferred income taxes and certain corporate maintained liabilities specifically allocable to each reporting unit to the net operating assets of each reporting unit 
the carrying amount is further reduced by impairment charges  if any  made to other long lived assets of a reporting unit 
since market prices of our reporting units are not readily available  we make various estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of the reporting units 
we use a discounted cash flow dcf model of a year forecast with terminal values to estimate the current fair value of our reporting units when testing for impairment 
the terminal value captures the value of a reporting unit beyond the projection period in a dcf analysis representing growth in perpetuity  and is the present value of all subsequent cash flows 
a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows  including sales volumes  profit margins  tax rates  capital spending  discount rates  and working capital changes 
forecasts of operating and selling  general and administrative expenses are generally based on historical relationships of previous years 
we use an equity value approach to determine the carrying and fair values of our reporting units 
when applying the dcf model  the cash flows expected to be generated are discounted to their present value equivalent using a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the investment  as well as the time value of money 
this return is an overall rate based upon the rates of return for invested equity capital 
for our analysis  using the build up method under the modified capital asset pricing capm model  we arrived at a discount rate of derived from the sum of the following inputs i a risk free rate of return of  based on the yield of the year u 
s treasury note as of december  ii an equity risk premium  multiplied by an average market beta of market participants in the industry which metalico operates  resulting in a rate of  and iii a company size risk premium of 
based on our dcf analysis  we determined the computed fair value of some of our reporting units did not exceed their respective carrying values and we were required to record goodwill impairment charges in our ohio and pittsburgh scrap metal recycling reporting units 
for the reporting units where the fair value exceeded their carrying values  we measure of the sensitivity of the amount of potential future goodwill impairment charges to changes in key assumptions 
several of our reporting units had fair values that exceeded carrying values by less than  an amount that we deem substantial 
we further tested these reporting units to reflect changes in forecasted cash flows and discount rates 
assuming all input variables remain constant  if expected cash flows 
table of contents were less than forecasted or  if the discount rate were increased by  the amount by which the carrying value exceeded the computed fair value for these reporting units  indicating potential impairment  would be as follows in thousands potential future impairment sensitivity reporting unit if expected cash flows were less than forecasted if the discount rate were new york state scrap recycling minor metals recycling bradford  pa scrap recycling at december   after considering a control premium of  the company s total stockholders equity exceeded market capitalization by approximately million which is one of many factors that are considered when determining goodwill impairment 
management believes domestic economic conditions continue to show improvement and have resulted in forecasts which  when used in our dcf model  support the remaining carrying value of goodwill in our reporting units 
although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable  actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates 
changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units  the amount of the goodwill impairment charge  or both 
future declines in the overall market value of the company s equity and debt securities may also result in a conclusion that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value 
intangible assets and other long lived assets we test all finite lived intangible assets amortizable and other long lived assets  such as fixed assets  for impairment only if circumstances indicate that possible impairment exists 
to the extent actual useful lives are less than our previously estimated lives  we will increase our amortization expense on a prospective basis 
we estimate useful lives of our intangible assets by reference to both contractual arrangements such as non compete covenants and current  projected  undiscounted cash flows for supplier and customer lists 
at december  and  no indicators of impairment were identified and no adjustments were made to the estimated lives of finite lived assets 
the company tests indefinite lived intangibles such as trademarks and trade names for impairment annually by comparing the carrying value of the intangible to its fair value 
fair value of the intangible asset is calculated using the projected discounted cash flows produced from the intangible 
if the carrying value exceeds the projected discounted cash flows attributed to the intangible asset  the carrying value is no longer considered recoverable and the company will record impairment 
as discussed in the goodwill section above  the reduction in forecasted revenues from recycling pgm material at our texas pgm facility resulted in an interim impairment charge of  to the carrying value of its trade name 
at december   the computed fair value of our indefinite lived intangibles exceeded their respective carrying values 
stock based compensation we recognize expense for equity based compensation ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value 
the fair value of deferred stock grants is determined using the average of the high and low trading price for our common stock on the day of grant 
for stock option grants  we calculate the fair value of the award on the date of grant using the black scholes method 
determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment  including estimates for the average risk free interest rate  dividend yield  volatility in our stock price  annual forfeiture rates  and exercise behavior 
any assumptions used may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time 
income taxes our provision for income taxes reflects income taxes paid or payable or received or receivable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year 
deferred taxes represent the 
table of contents future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid  and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized

table of contents scrap and metal commodity markets recycled iron and steel scrap is a vital raw material for the production of new steel and cast iron products 
the steel and foundry industries in the united states have been structured to recycle scrap  and  as a result  are highly dependent upon scrap 
according to the steel recycling institute sri  the recycling rate for the world s most recycled material steel was at an all time high of percent at the end of more than million tons of steel scrap was consumed by steelmaking furnaces in  an increase of nearly million net tons versus in the united states  the primary source of old steel scrap is the automobile 
automobile recycling rates have regained balance at in this figure came after several years in excess of percent meaning more old cars had been coming off the road than new ones going back onto it 
the recycling rate for automobiles in  reached about 
a recycling rate greater than is a result of the steel industry recycling more steel from automobiles than was used in the domestic production of new vehicles 
in  the automotive recycling industry recycled more than million tons of steel from end of life vehicles through more than car shredders  the equivalent of nearly million automobiles 
more than  vehicle dismantlers throughout north america resell parts 
recycling of scrap plays an important role in the conservation of energy because the remelting of scrap requires much less energy than the production of iron or steel products from iron ore 
also  consumption of iron and steel scrap by remelting reduces the burden on landfill disposal facilities and prevents the accumulation of abandoned steel products in the environment 
recycled scrap consists of approximately post consumer old  obsolete scrap  prompt scrap produced in steel product manufacturing plants  and home scrap recirculating scrap from current operations 
scrap prices fluctuated during the first months of  between about and per ton 
composite prices published by scrap price bulletin for no 
heavy melting steel scrap delivered to purchasers in chicago  illinois  and philadelphia and pittsburgh  pennsylvania  averaged about per ton during the first months of as reported by scrap price bulletin  the average price for nickel bearing stainless steel scrap delivered to purchasers in pittsburgh was about  per ton during the first months of  which was lower than the average price of  per ton 
exports of ferrous scrap decreased in to an estimated million tons from million tons during  mainly to turkey  the republic of korea  taiwan  canada and china  in descending order of export tonnage 
export scrap value decreased from billion in to an estimated billion in continuing and growing concern about the european union sovereign debt and banking crisis have adversely affected steel consumer confidence  depressed steel demand  production  and prices  and  thus  caused ferrous scrap prices to fluctuate considerably 
world steel consumption was expected to increase by in and in  following annual growth in and in  according to the world steel association 
according to reports published by the us geological survey usgs  in  old scrap  converted to refined metal and alloys  provided  tons of copper  equivalent to of apparent consumption 
purchased new scrap  derived from fabricating operations  yielded  tons of contained copper 
of the total copper recovered from scrap including aluminum and nickel based scrap  brass mills recovered  miscellaneous manufacturers  foundries  and chemical plants   ingot makers   and copper smelters and refiners  
copper in all old and new  refined or remelted scrap contributed about of the us copper supply 
although refined copper prices remained volatile during the first months of  they traded within a narrower range than in recent years 
the comex spot copper price began at per pound of copper  rose to per pound in april  and declined to a low of per pound in june before trending back to per pound in september and settling around at year end 
the copper supply and demand balance remained tight  in part owing to an year on year increase in china s net imports in the first half of  well in excess of industrial demand 

table of contents aluminum recovered from purchased scrap in the us was about million tons  of which about came from new manufacturing scrap and from old scrap discarded aluminum products 
aluminum recovered from old scrap was equivalent to about of apparent consumption

the monthly average price began a downward trend  reaching per pound in august 
the monthly average price increased to per pound in september and fell back below at year end 
prices on the london metal exchange lme followed the trend of us market prices 
in  lead was consumed at about manufacturing plants 
the lead acid battery industry continued to be the principal user of lead  accounting for about of the reported us lead consumption for in  about million tons of secondary lead was produced  an amount equivalent to of reported domestic lead consumption 
nearly all of it was recovered from old post consumer scrap 
the global lead market was in surplus during owing to the buildup of lead stocks held in london metal exchange lme and producer warehouses

future capital requirements as of december   we had million in cash  availability under the credit agreement of million and total working capital of million 
as of december   our current liabilities totaled million 
we expect to fund our current working capital needs  interest payments and capital expenditures with cash on hand and cash generated from operations  supplemented by borrowings available under our current credit agreement and potentially available elsewhere  such as vendor financing  manufacturer financing  operating leases and other equipment lines of credit that are offered to us from time to time 
we may also access equity and debt markets for possible acquisitions  working capital and to restructure current debt 
historically  the company has entered into negotiations with its lenders when it was reasonably concerned about potential breaches and prior to the occurrences of covenant defaults 
a breach of any of the covenants contained in lending agreements could result in default under such agreements 
in the event of a default  a lender could refuse to make additional advances under the revolving portion of a credit facility  could require the company to repay some or all of its outstanding debt prior to maturity  and or could declare all amounts borrowed by the company  together with accrued interest  to be due and payable 
in the event that this occurs  the company may be unable to repay all such accelerated indebtedness  which could have a material adverse impact on its financial position and operating performance 
our credit agreement matures on january  we are in negotiations to extend or modify the existing credit agreement with our current lenders 
we may also seek to obtain financing from other lenders 
we can give no assurance that we will be able to enter into an agreement with terms as favorable as the current credit agreement  or if at all 
if necessary  we may attempt to access equity and debt markets or to obtain new financing arrangements with new lenders or investors as alternative funding sources to restructure current debt 
any issuance of new equity could dilute current shareholders 
any new debt financing could be on terms less favorable than those of our existing financing and could subject us to new and additional covenants 
decisions by lenders and investors to enter into such transactions with the company would depend upon a number of factors  such as the company s historical and projected financial performance  compliance with the terms of its current or future credit agreements  industry and market trends  internal policies of prospective lenders and investors  and the availability of capital 
no assurance can be had that the company would be successful in obtaining funds from alternative sources 
off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases  we do not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements that are likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  result of operations or cash flows 
acquisitions as discussed in note to the financial statements  in  we acquired of the outstanding capital stock of skyway auto parts  inc  an auto dismantler located in buffalo  new york  we acquired substantially all of the assets  including real property  of bergen auto recycling llc  an auto dismantler located in bergen  new york  and we formed a joint venture to co operate a new scrap recycling facility in cleveland  ohio 
in  we acquired of the outstanding capital stock of goodman services  inc  a bradford  pennsylvania based full service recycling company with additional facilities in jamestown  new york and canton  ohio 
these acquisitions are consistent with our expansion strategy of penetrating geographically contiguous markets and benefiting from intercompany and operating synergies that are available through consolidation 
we will continue to seek opportunities to acquire smaller tuck in operations on terms we deem favorable 

table of contents capital expenditures for the year ended december   we continued to make significant investments in our operations and expended million on capital improvements and equipment 
our additions in included the purchase of the land and building and made significant additions to the facility where our texas pgm recycling facility operates in order to expand the operation into the traditional scrap metal market for a total of million 
we completed the buffalo  new york shredder facility and added related support equipment totaling million 
we also refurbished our shredder and made site improvements to our facility in youngstown ohio at a cost of million 
for the year ended december   the company expended million for capital improvements and equipment 
the most significant expenditure was for the purchase of a acre parcel of land  including a  square foot building  in suburban buffalo and related costs to install an indoor scrap metal shredder at the site 
the company has concluded two years of expansion capital expenditure spending and management anticipates significant reductions in capital expenditures for contingencies we are involved in certain other legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
in the opinion of management  the outcome of such other proceedings and litigation will not materially affect the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
three of our subsidiaries have been named in preference actions filed in the pending bankruptcies of rg steel  llc  and its affiliates 
certain subsidiaries of ours are also unsecured creditors of rg steel  llc  and its affiliates and have claims for payment pending against the debtors 
these debtor claims are carried on our balance sheet at expected recoverable values 
we believe we have substantial defenses to a significant portion of the preference claims against us 
we have recorded a reserve of  in current liabilities for what we believe is our exposure against potential liability  however  we can give no assurance that the amount will not increase 
the company does not carry  and does not expect to carry for the foreseeable future  significant insurance coverage for environmental liability because the company believes that the cost for such insurance is not economical 
however  we continue to monitor products offered by various insurers that may prove to be practical 
accordingly  if the company were to incur liability for environmental damage in excess of accrued environmental remediation liabilities  its consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
the company and its subsidiaries are at this time in material compliance with all of their pending remediation obligations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial risk resulting from fluctuations in interest rates and commodity prices 
we seek to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our floating rate borrowings 
as of december   million of our outstanding debt consisted of variable rate borrowings pursuant to the credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank  na borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at either  the prime rate of interest plus a margin or libor plus a margin 
increases in either the prime rate or libor may increase interest expense 
assuming our variable borrowings at december  were to equal the average borrowings under our senior secured credit facility during a fiscal year  a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates by would increase or decrease interest expense on our variable borrowings by approximately  per year with a corresponding change in cash flows 
we have no open interest rate protection agreements as of december  
table of contents commodity price risk we are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in the market price for both ferrous  non ferrous  pgm and lead metals which are at times volatile 
see the discussion under the section entitled risk factors the metals recycling industry is highly cyclical and export markets can be volatile located in this annual report 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by seeking to turn our inventories quickly as markets allow instead of holding inventories in anticipation of higher commodity prices 
we use forward sales contracts with pgm substrate processors to hedge against the extremely volatile pgm metal prices 
the company estimates that if selling prices decreased by in any of the business units in which it operates  there would not be a material write down of any reported inventory values 
foreign currency risk international sales account for an immaterial amount of our consolidated net sales and all of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
we also purchase a small percentage of our raw materials from international vendors and these purchases are also denominated in local currencies 
consequently  we do not enter into any foreign currency swaps to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the currency rates 
risk from common stock market price we are exposed to risks associated with the market price of our own common stock 
in connection with certain financings  we have issued warrants that can be put to us upon a change of control 
we are required to use the value of our common stock as an input variable to determine the fair value of the liability associated with the put warrant 
fluctuations in the market price of our common stock have an effect on the liability 
for example  if the price of our common stock was higher as of december   the put warrant liability would increase by
