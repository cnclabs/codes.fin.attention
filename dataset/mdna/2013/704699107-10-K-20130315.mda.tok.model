the dodd frank act also authorized the securities and exchange commission sec to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate and solicit votes for their own candidates using a company s proxy materials 
however  on july   the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit struck down the sec s proposed proxy access rules 
on june   the sec adopted final rules regarding heightened independence requirements for compensation committee members 
these rules require stock exchanges to adopt listing standards that address i independence of compensation committee members  ii the compensation committee s authority to retain compensation advisers  iii the compensation committee s consideration of the independence of any compensation advisers  and iv the compensation committee s responsibility for the appointment  compensation and oversight of the work of any compensation adviser

the cfpb took over responsibility over the principal federal consumer protection laws  such as the truth in lending act  the equal credit opportunity act  the real estate settlement procedures act and the truth in saving act  among others  on july  institutions that have assets of billion or less  such as the bank  will continue to be supervised in this area by their primary federal regulators in the case of the bank  the federal reserve board frb 
the act also gives the cfpb expanded data collecting powers for fair lending purposes for both small business and mortgage loans  as well as expanded authority to prevent unfair  deceptive and abusive practices 
the cfpb continued to propose amendments to mortgage regulations in august and september of  and in january  the cfpb issued final rules for several of the regulations 
on january   the cfpb issued a final rule amending regulation z to implement certain amendments to the truth in lending act 
the rule implements statutory changes that lengthen the time for which a mandatory escrow account established for a higher priced mortgage loan must be maintained 
the rule also exempts certain transactions from the statute s escrow requirement 
the rule will become effective on june  also on january   the cfpb issued a final rule implementing amendments to the truth in lending act and the real estate settlement procedures act 
the rule amends regulation z by expanding the types of mortgage loans that are subject to the protections of the home ownership and equity protections act of hoepa  revising and expanding the tests for coverage under hoepa  and imposing additional restrictions on mortgages that are covered by hoepa  including a pre loan counseling requirement 
the rule also amends regulation z and regulation x by imposing other requirements related to homeownership counseling 
the rule will become effective on january  
table of contents on january   the cfpb amended regulation b to implement changes to the equal credit opportunity act 
the revisions to regulation b require creditors to provide applicants with free copies of all appraisals and other written valuations developed in connection with an application for a loan to be secured by a first lien on a dwelling  and require creditors to notify applicants in writing that copies of appraisals will be provided to them promptly

this rule also establishes tests for when loan originators can be compensated through certain profits based compensation arrangements 
the amendments to h and i are effective on june   while the other provisions of the rule are effective on january  certain changes in the new mortgage rules promulgated by the cfpb would be applicable to the bank and the corporation 
the cfpb is expected to issue additional final rules regarding mortgages in the dodd frank act contains numerous other provisions affecting financial institutions of all types  many of which may have an impact on our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways 
consequently  the dodd frank act is likely to continue to increase our cost of doing business  it may limit or expand our permissible activities  and it may affect the competitive balance within our industry and market areas 
the nature and extent of future legislative and regulatory changes affecting financial institutions  including as a result of the dodd frank act  remains very unpredictable at this time 
capital requirements the corporation s wholly owned subsidiary is subject to risk based capital guidelines for banks as adopted by the frb 
the minimum guideline for the ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is 
at least half of the total capital is to be comprised of common stock  retained earnings  minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock  less goodwill and certain other intangibles tier capital 
the remainder may consist of other preferred stock  certain other instruments and a portion of the loan loss allowance 
at december   the bank s tier capital and total capital ratios were and  respectively 
in addition  the frb has established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for banks 
these guidelines provide for a minimum ratio of tier capital to average total assets of for banks that meet certain specified criteria  including having the highest regulatory rating 
all other banks generally are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least plus an additional cushion of to basis points 
the bank leverage ratio at december  was 
basel iii in december  the basel committee released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation  now officially identified by the basel committee as basel iii 
basel iii  when implemented by the us banking agencies and fully phased in  will require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital  with a greater emphasis on common equity 
the basel iii final capital framework  among other things  i introduces as a new capital measure common equity tier cet  ii specifies that tier capital consists of cet and additional tier capital instruments meeting specified requirements  iii defines cet narrowly by requiring that most adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to cet and not to the other components of capital and iv expands the scope of the adjustments as compared to existing regulations 
when fully phased in on january   basel iii requires banks to maintain i as a newly adopted international standard  a minimum ratio of cet to risk weighted assets of at least  plus a capital conservation buffer which is added to the cet ratio as that buffer is phased in  effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of cet to risk weighted assets of at least  ii a minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets of at least  plus the capital conservation buffer which is added to the tier capital ratio as that buffer is phased in  effectively resulting in a minimum tier capital ratio of upon full implementation  iii a minimum ratio of total that is  tier plus tier capital to risk weighted assets of at least  plus the capital conservation buffer which is added to the total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in  effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of upon full implementation and iv as a newly adopted international standard  a minimum leverage ratio of  calculated as the ratio of tier capital to balance sheet exposures plus certain off balance sheet exposures computed as the average for each quarter of the month end ratios for the quarter 

table of contents basel iii also provides for a countercyclical capital buffer  generally to be imposed when national regulators determine that excess aggregate credit growth becomes associated with a buildup of systemic risk  that would be a cet add on to the capital conservation buffer in the range of to when fully implemented potentially resulting in total buffers of between and 
the aforementioned capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress 
banking institutions with a ratio of cet to risk weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer  when the latter is applied will face constraints on dividends  equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall 
upon implementation of the basel iii final framework  banking institutions will be required to meet the following minimum capital ratios cet to risk weighted assets 
tier capital to risk weighted assets 
total capital to risk weighted assets 
the basel iii final framework provides for a number of new deductions from and adjustments to cet these include  for example  the requirement that mortgage servicing rights  deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in non consolidated financial entities be deducted from cet to the extent that any one such category exceeds of cet or all such categories in the aggregate exceed of cet implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to cet is scheduled to begin on january  and will be phased in over a five year period per year 
the implementation of the capital conservation buffer will begin on january  at and be phased in over a four year period increasing by that amount on each subsequent january  until it reaches on january  
on january   the basel committee released the revised basel iii liquidity coverage ratio lcr 
the revised lcr standards allow banks to use a broader range of liquid assets to meet their liquidity buffer and reduce some of the run off assumptions that banks must make in calculating their net cash outflows 
the revised standards also clarify that banks may dip below the minimum lcr requirement during periods of stress 
the basel committee expects national regulators to implement the lcr on a phased in basis beginning on january  though the frb has expressed its intent to implement some version of the lcr and other basel iii liquidity standards in the united states  the scope and timing of us implementation currently is unclear 
the basel committee is considering further amendments to basel iii  including the imposition of additional capital surcharges on globally systemically important financial institutions 
in addition to basel iii  dodd frank requires or permits the federal banking agencies to adopt regulations affecting banking institutions capital requirements in a number of respects  including potentially more stringent capital requirements for systemically important financial institutions 
the frb and the fdic were part of a joint proposal in june seeking comment on three notices of proposed rulemaking npr that would revise and replace the agencies current capital rules in connection with the basel accords 
the two nprs discussed below concern capital issues of significant importance to the bank and  under certain circumstances  the company 
the third npr  which relates to advanced approaches and market risk capital rules  is not applicable to the organization s current operations 
the first npr relates to basel iii and proposes to revise risk based and leverage capital requirements  including the implementation of new common equity tier capital requirements and a higher minimum tier capital requirement 
also included in the npr are proposed limitations on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments for any banking organization not holding a specified buffer of common equity tier capital in excess of its minimum risk based capital requirement 
revisions to the prompt correction action framework and the tangible common equity definition are also included in the npr 
the other npr applicable to the organization s operations proposes a standardized approach for risk weighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity and to address certain weaknesses identified over recent years  including methods for determining risk weighted assets for residential mortgages  securitization exposures and counterparty credit risk 
the proposed changes in the two nprs would be applicable to the bank and the corporation as long as the corporation s assets continue to exceed million 

table of contents the comment period for these nprs ended on october  since basel iii was intended to be implemented beginning january   the regulators intended to finalize the rules by that date 
however  on november   the federal agencies that proposed the nprs announced that they do not expect that any of the proposed rules would become effective on january  moreover  the announcement did not indicate the likely new effective date 
fdicia pursuant to the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia  each federal banking agency has promulgated regulations  specifying the levels at which a financial institution would be considered well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized  and to take certain mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions based on the capital level of the institution 
the regulations implementing these provisions of fdicia provide that a bank is defined to be well capitalized if it maintains a leverage ratio of at least  a risk adjusted tier capital ratio of at least and a risk adjusted total capital ratio of at least and is not otherwise in a troubled condition as specified by its appropriate federal regulatory agency 
a bank is defined to be adequately capitalized if it meets other minimum capital requirements 
in addition  a depository institution will be considered undercapitalized if it fails to meet any minimum required measure  significantly undercapitalized if it is significantly below such measure and critically undercapitalized if it fails to maintain a level of tangible equity equal to not less than of total assets 
a depository institution may be deemed to be in a capitalization category that is lower than is indicated by its actual capital position if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating 
insurance funds legislation the bank s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the deposit insurance fund of the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic 
the deposit insurance fund is the successor to the bank insurance fund and the savings association insurance fund  which were merged in under the fdic s risk based system  insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations  regulatory capital levels and certain other factors with less risky institutions paying lower assessments on their deposits 
on november   the fdic issued a final rule that required insured depository institutions to prepay  on december   their estimated quarterly risk based assessments for the fourth quarter of and for all of  and  together with their quarterly risk based assessment for the third quarter the bank paid approximately million in assessments as of december  of which approximately million was recorded as a prepaid asset 
prepaid assessments are to be applied against the actual quarterly assessments until exhausted  and may not be applied to any special assessments that may occur in the future 
any unused prepayments will be returned to the bank on june  the balance of the prepaid fdic assessment fees at december  was million 
in february  as required by the dodd frank act  the fdic approved a final rule that revised the assessment base to consist of average consolidated total assets during the assessment period minus the average tangible equity during the assessment period 
in addition  the final revisions eliminated the adjustment for secured borrowings  including federal home loan bank advances  and made certain other changes to the impact of unsecured borrowings and brokered deposits on an institution s deposit insurance assessment 
the final rule also revised the assessment rate schedule to provide initial base assessment rates ranging from to basis points and total base assessment rates ranging from to basis points after adjustment 
the final rule became effective on april  as previously noted above  the dodd frank act makes permanent the thousand limit for federal deposit insurance 
it also provided unlimited federal deposit insurance through december  for non interest bearing demand transaction accounts and ioltas at all insured depository institutions 
this provision lapsed at the beginning of deposits held in noninterest bearing transaction accounts are now aggregated with any interest bearing deposits the owner may hold in the same ownership category  and the combined total will be insured up to at least thousand 
the fdic has authority to further increase insurance assessments 
a significant increase in insurance premiums may have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the bank 
management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future 

table of contents troubled asset relief capital purchase program in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions  on october   the emergency economic stabilization act of the eesa was signed into law 
pursuant to the eesa  the us treasury was given the authority to  among other things  purchase up to billion of mortgages  mortgage backed securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
on october   the secretary of the us department of the treasury announced that the treasury will purchase equity stakes in a wide variety of banks and thrifts 
under the program  known as the troubled asset relief program capital purchase program the tarp capital purchase program  from the billion authorized by the eesa  the treasury made billion of capital available to us financial institutions in the form of preferred stock 
in conjunction with the purchase of preferred stock  the treasury received  from participating financial institutions  warrants to purchase common stock with an aggregate market price equal to of the preferred investment 
participating financial institutions were required to adopt the treasury s standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which the treasury holds equity issued under the tarp capital purchase program 
the corporation entered into a securities purchase agreement with the treasury that provides for our participation in the tarp capital purchase program

upon redemption of the final preferred shares  the corporation s participation in the cpp ended  and the corporation is no longer subject to the requirements of the cpp  including certain limits on executive compensation 
the corporation repurchased the warrant from the treasury on april  restrictions on the payment of dividends the holders of the corporation s common stock are entitled to receive dividends  when  as and if declared by the board of directors of the corporation out of funds legally available 
the only statutory limitation is that such dividends may not be paid when the corporation is insolvent 
since the principal source of income for the corporation will be dividends on bank common stock paid to the corporation by the bank  the corporation s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders will depend on whether the bank pays dividends to it 
as a practical matter  restrictions on the ability of the bank to pay dividends act as restrictions on the amount of funds available for the payment of dividends by the corporation 
as a new jersey chartered commercial bank  the bank is subject to the restrictions on the payment of dividends contained in the new jersey banking act of  as amended the banking act 
under the banking act  the bank may pay dividends only out of retained earnings  and out of surplus to the extent that surplus exceeds of stated capital

under certain circumstances  the fdic could claim that the payment of a dividend or other distribution by the bank to the corporation constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice 
the corporation is also subject to frb policies  which may  in certain circumstances  limit its ability to pay dividends 
the frb policies require  among other things  that a bank holding company maintain a minimum capital base and serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary bank 
the frb by supervisory letters has advised holding corporations that it is has supervisory concerns when the level of dividends is too high and would seek to prevent dividends if the dividends paid by the holding company exceeded its earnings 
the frb would most likely seek to prohibit any dividend payment that would reduce a holding company s capital below these minimum amounts 
holding company supervision the corporation is a bank holding company within the meaning of the holding company act 
as a bank holding company  the corporation is supervised by the frb and is required to file reports with the frb and provide such additional information as the frb may require 

table of contents the holding company act prohibits the corporation  with certain exceptions  from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than five percent of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank and from engaging in any business other than that of banking  managing and controlling banks or furnishing services to subsidiary banks  except that it may  upon application  engage in  and may own shares of companies engaged in  certain businesses found by the frb to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto 
the holding company act requires prior approval by the frb of the acquisition by the corporation of more than five percent of the voting stock of any additional bank 
satisfactory capital ratios  community reinvestment act ratings and anti money laundering policies are generally prerequisites to obtaining federal regulatory approval to make acquisitions 
the policy of the frb provides that a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support the subsidiary bank in circumstances in which it might not do so absent that policy 
acquisitions through the bank require the approval of the frb and the new jersey department of banking and insurance njdobi

the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act may affect our business activities  financial position and profitability by increasing our regulatory compliance burden and associated costs  placing restrictions on certain products and services  and limiting our future capital raising strategies 
on july   the president signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the act  which implements significant changes in the financial regulatory landscape and will impact all financial institutions  including the corporation and the bank 
the act has and is likely to continue to increase our regulatory compliance burden 
among the act s significant regulatory changes  it created the cfpb that is empowered to promulgate new consumer protection regulations and revise existing regulations in many areas of consumer protection 
the cfpb has exclusive authority to issue regulations  orders and guidance to administer and implement the objectives of federal consumer protection laws 
moreover  the act permits states to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and state attorney generals may enforce consumer protection rules issued by the cfpb 
the act also changes the scope of federal deposit insurance coverage  and increases the fdic assessment payable by the bank 
the cfpb and these other changes have increased  and will continue to increase  our regulatory compliance burden and costs and may restrict the financial products and services we offer to our customers 
the act also imposed more stringent capital requirements on bank holding companies by  among other things  imposing leverage ratios on bank holding companies and prohibiting new trust preferred issuances from counting as tier i capital 
these restrictions may limit our future capital strategies 
the act also increases regulation of derivatives and hedging transactions  which could limit our ability to enter into  or increase the costs associated with  interest rate and other hedging transactions 
although certain provisions of the act  such as required direct supervision by the cfpb  will not apply to banking organizations with less than billion of assets  such as the corporation and the bank  the changes resulting from the legislation will impact our business 
new consumer protection rules issued by the cfpb will apply to us 
these changes will require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes 
negative developments in the financial services industry and us and global credit markets may adversely impact our operations and results 
uncertainty in the financial markets in general with the expectation of the general economic downturn continued in and may continue through loan portfolio performances have deteriorated at many institutions resulting from  amongst other factors  a weak economy and a decline in the value of the collateral supporting their loans 
the competition for our deposits has increased significantly due to liquidity concerns at many of these same institutions 
stock prices of bank holding companies  like ours  have been negatively affected by the current condition of the financial markets  as has our ability  if needed  to raise capital or borrow in the debt markets compared to recent years 
as a result  there is potential for new federal or state laws and regulations regarding lending and funding practices and liquidity standards  and financial institution regulatory agencies are expected to be very aggressive in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations  including the expected issuance of many formal enforcement actions 
negative developments in the financial services industry and the impact of new legislation in response to those developments could negatively impact our operations by restricting our business operations  including our ability to originate or sell loans  and adversely impact our financial performance 
much of our business is with customers located within morris  somerset  middlesex  union and hunterdon counties and contiguous counties 
our business loans are generally made to small to mid sized businesses  most of whose success depends on the regional economy 
these businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities 
adverse economic and business conditions in our market area could reduce our growth rate  affect our borrowers ability to repay their loans and  consequently  adversely affect our financial condition and performance 
further  we place substantial reliance on real estate as collateral for our loan portfolio 
a sharp downturn in real estate values in our market area could leave many of our loans under secured  which could adversely affect our earnings 

table of contents if our allowance for loan losses were not sufficient to cover actual loan losses  our earnings would decrease 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses based on  among other things  national and regional economic conditions  and historical loss experience and delinquency trends among loan types 
however  we cannot predict loan losses with certainty and we cannot assure you that charge offs in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  review our allowance for loan losses and may require additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examination 
factors that require an increase in our allowance for loan losses could reduce our earnings 
changes in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 
our net income depends primarily upon our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on loans  investments and other interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on deposits and borrowed funds 
different types of assets and liabilities may react differently  and at different times  to changes in market interest rates 
we expect that we will periodically experience gaps in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities 
that means either our interest bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest earning assets  or vice versa 
when interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets  an increase in market rates of interest could reduce our net interest income 
likewise  when interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities  falling interest rates could reduce our net interest income 
we are unable to predict changes in market interest rates  which are affected by many factors beyond our control  including inflation  recession  unemployment  money supply  domestic and international events and changes in the united states and other financial markets 
we may not be able to continue to grow our business  which may adversely impact our results of operations 
our business strategy calls for continued expansion 
our ability to continue to grow depends  in part  upon our ability to open new branch locations  successfully attract deposits to existing and new branches  and identify favorable loan and investment opportunities 
we expect to add personnel to assist in this growth 
in the event that we do not continue to grow  or the new personnel do not produce sufficient new revenues  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
we may not be able to manage our growth  which may adversely impact our financial results 
as part of our expansion strategy  we plan to hire new personnel and to open new branches in our existing and target markets 
however  we may be unable to identify attractive locations on terms favorable to us or to hire qualified management 
in addition  the organizational and overhead costs may be greater than we anticipated 
moreover  we may not be able to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to open new branches 
new branches and new business expansion efforts may take longer than expected to reach profitability  and we cannot assure that they will become profitable 
the additional costs of adding new personnel and or starting new branches may adversely impact our financial results 
our ability to manage growth successfully will depend on whether we can continue to fund this growth while maintaining cost controls and asset quality  as well as on factors beyond our control  such as national and regional economic conditions and interest rate trends 
if we are not able to control costs and maintain asset quality  such growth could adversely impact our earnings and financial condition 
the corporation is required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support its operations 
the corporation may at some point need to raise additional capital to support continued growth 
the corporation ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside the corporation control  and on its financial performance 
accordingly  the corporation cannot assure you of its ability to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to the corporation 
if the corporation cannot raise additional capital when needed  the ability to further expand its operations could be materially impaired 
our exposure to credit risk could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 
there are certain risks inherent in making loans 
these risks include interest rate changes over the time period in which loans may be repaid  risks resulting from changes in the economy  risks inherent in dealing with borrowers and  in the case of a loan backed by collateral  risks resulting from uncertainties about the future value of the collateral 

table of contents competition from other financial institutions in originating loans and attracting deposits may adversely affect our profitability 
we face substantial competition in originating loans 
this competition comes principally from other banks  savings institutions  mortgage banking companies and other lenders 
many of our competitors enjoy advantages  including greater financial resources and higher lending limits  a wider geographic presence  and more accessible branch office locations 
in attracting deposits  we face substantial competition from other insured depository institutions such as banks  savings institutions and credit unions  as well as institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives  including money market funds 
many of our competitors enjoy advantages  including greater financial resources  more aggressive marketing campaigns  better brand recognition and more branch locations 
these competitors may offer higher interest rates than we do  which could decrease the deposits that we attract or require us to increase our rates to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits 
increased deposit competition could adversely affect our ability to generate the funds necessary for lending operations and increase our cost of funds 
we also compete with non bank providers of financial services  such as brokerage firms  consumer finance companies  insurance companies and governmental organizations  which may offer more favorable terms 
some of our non bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern our operations 
as a result  such non bank competitors may have advantages over us in providing certain products and services 
this competition may reduce or limit our margins on banking services  reduce our market share and adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 
government regulation significantly affects our business 
the banking industry is extensively regulated 
banking regulations are intended primarily to protect depositors  and the fdic deposit insurance funds  not the shareholders of the corporation 
we are subject to regulation and supervision by the new jersey department of banking and insurance and the federal reserve bank 
regulatory requirements affect our lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy and growth 
the bank regulatory agencies possess broad authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law 
we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements  which involve both quantitative measures of our assets and liabilities and qualitative judgments by regulators regarding risks and other factors 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements or comply with other regulations could result in actions by regulators that could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends or otherwise adversely impact operations 
in addition  changes in laws  regulations and regulatory practices affecting the banking industry may limit the manner in which we conduct our business 
such changes may adversely affect us  including our ability to offer new products and services  obtain financing  attract deposits  make loans and achieve satisfactory spreads and may impose additional costs on us 
the bank is also subject to a number of federal laws  which  among other things  require it to lend to various sectors of the economy and population  and establish and maintain comprehensive programs relating to anti money laundering and customer identification 
the bank compliance with these laws will be considered by the federal banking regulators when reviewing bank merger and bank holding company acquisitions or commencing new activities or making new investments in reliance on the gramm leach bliley act 
as a public company  we are also subject to the corporate governance standards set forth in the sarbanes oxley act  as well as any rules or regulations promulgated by the sec or the nasdaq stock market 
higher fdic deposit insurance premiums and assessments could adversely affect our financial condition 
fdic insurance premiums increased substantially in and we may have to pay significantly higher fdic premiums in the future 
market developments have significantly depleted the insurance fund of the fdic and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits 
the fdic adopted a revised risk based deposit insurance assessment schedule on february   which raised regular deposit insurance premiums 
on may   the fdic also implemented a five basis point special assessment of each insured depository institution s total assets minus tier capital as of june   but no more than basis points times the institution s assessment base for the second quarter of  collected by the fdic on september  the amount of this special assessment for the bank was thousand 
additional special assessments may be imposed by the fdic for future quarters at the same or higher levels 
the dodd frank act revised the assessment rate schedule to provide initial base assessment rates ranging from five to basis points and total base assessment rates ranging from to basis points 
these changes  along with the use of all of our remaining fdic insurance assessment credits in early  may cause the premiums charged by the fdic to increase 
these actions could significantly increase our noninterest expense in and in future periods 

table of contents we are subject to liquidity risk 
liquidity risk is the potential that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they become due  capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise  or pay regular dividends because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding in a timely basis  at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances 
liquidity is required to fund various obligations  including credit commitments to borrowers  mortgage and other loan originations  withdrawals by depositors  repayment of borrowings  dividends to shareholders  operating expenses and capital expenditures 
liquidity is derived primarily from retail deposit growth and retention  principal and interest payments on loans  principal and interest payments  sale  maturity and prepayment of investment securities  net cash provided from operations and access to other funding sources 
our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general 
factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us 
our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us  such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole as banking organizations face turmoil and domestic and worldwide credit markets deteriorate 
our information systems may experience a security breach  computer virus  or disruption of service 
we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business  and provide customers with various products and services  including the ability to bank online 
despite positioning our communications and information systems environment to be capable of controlling  monitoring and proactively preventing security breaches  our network could become vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer viruses  phishing schemes and other security problems 
we may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses  or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses 
to the extent that our activities or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information  security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims  litigation and other possible liabilities 
any failure  interruption  or breach in security or operational integrity of our systems could also result in failures or disruptions in our general ledger  deposit  loan  and other systems  and could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny 
any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and could adversely affect our reputation 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate 
the price of our common stock on the nasdaq global select market constantly changes and recently  given the uncertainty in the financial markets  has fluctuated widely 
we expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate 
holders of our common stock will be subject to the risk of volatility and changes in prices 
our common stock price can fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include quarterly fluctuations in our operating and financial results  operating results that vary from the expectations of management  securities analysts and investors  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors  events negatively impacting the financial services industry which result in a general decline in the market valuation of our common stock  announcements of material developments affecting our operations or our dividend policy  future sales of our equity securities  new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business  changes in accounting standards  policies  guidance  interpretations or principles  and general domestic economic and market conditions 

table of contents in addition  recently the stock market generally has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  and industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events  such as economic slowdowns or recessions  interest rate changes or credit loss trends  could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of our operating results 
our ability to pay dividends to our common shareholders is limited 
since the principal source of income for the corporation is dividends paid to the corporation by the bank  the corporation ability to pay dividends to its shareholders will depend on whether the bank pays dividends to it 
as a practical matter  restrictions on the ability of the bank to pay dividends act as restrictions on the amount of funds available for the payment of dividends by the corporation 
as a new jersey chartered commercial bank  the bank is subject to the restrictions on the payment of dividends contained in the new jersey banking act of  as amended 
under the banking act  the bank may pay dividends only out of retained earnings  and out of surplus to the extent that surplus exceeds of stated capital 
the corporation is also subject to frb policies  which may  in certain circumstances  limit its ability to pay dividends 
the frb policies require  among other things  that a bank holding company maintain a minimum capital base and the frb in supervisory guidance has cautioned bank holding companies about paying out too much of their earnings in dividends and has stated that banks should not pay out more in dividends than they earn 
the frb would most likely seek to prohibit any dividend payment that would reduce a holding company capital below these minimum amounts 
we may lose lower cost funding sources 
checking  savings  and money market deposit account balances and other forms of customer deposits can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments  such as the stock market  as providing a better risk return tradeoff 
if customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments  we could lose a relatively low cost source of funds  increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income and net income 
there may be changes in accounting policies or accounting standards 
our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our financial results and condition 
some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results 
we identified our accounting policies regarding the allowance for loan losses  goodwill and other intangible assets  and income taxes to be critical because they require management to make difficult  subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
under each of these policies  it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions  using different assumptions  or as new information becomes available 
from time to time the financial accounting standards board fasb and the sec change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the form and content of our external financial statements 
in addition  accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards such as the fasb  sec  banking regulators and our independent auditors may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied 
changes in financial accounting and reporting standards and changes in current interpretations may be beyond our control  can be hard to predict and could materially impact how we report our financial results and condition 
in certain cases  we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively or apply an existing standard differently also retroactively which may result in our restating prior period financial statements in material amounts 
we encounter continuous technological change 
the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands  as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers 
failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and  in turn  our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we are subject to operational risk 
we face the risk that the design of our controls and procedures  including those to mitigate the risk of fraud by employees or outsiders  may prove to be inadequate or are circumvented  thereby causing delays in detection of errors or inaccuracies in data and information 
management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may also be subject to disruptions of our systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control including  for example  computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages  which may give rise to losses in service to customers and to financial loss or liability 
we are further exposed to the risk that our external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as we are and to the risk that our or our vendors business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate 
our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals 
there is intense competition in the financial services industry for qualified employees 
in addition  we face increasing competition with businesses outside the financial services industry for the most highly skilled individuals 
our business operations could be adversely affected if we were unable to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees 
there may be claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility 
from time to time as part of the corporation s normal course of business  customers make claims and take legal action against the corporation based on its actions or inactions 
if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to the corporation  they may result in financial liability and or adversely affect the market perception of the corporation and its products and services 
this may also impact customer demand for the corporation s products and services 
any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s business  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations

peapack gladstone financial corporation the corporation or the company  formed in  is the parent holding company for peapack gladstone bank the bank  formed in  a commercial bank operating branches in somerset  hunterdon  morris  middlesex and union counties 
for the year ended december   peapack gladstone financial corporation recorded net income of million  and diluted earnings per share of 
several strategic steps were taken during the fourth quarter of that we believe have positioned the company well for the future 
these strategic initiatives have strengthened the corporation s core operating base as it embarks on a plan to grow its core lending  retail  and wealth advisory businesses  while maintaining and enhancing its high levels of customer service 
the fourth quarter included the following strategic initiatives the position of chairman and ceo was split when doug kennedy joined the company as ceo in early october frank kissel remained as chairman of the board 
professional  legal  and other costs totaling approximately thousand were recorded in connection with the ceo search 
approximately million of classified loans were transferred to loans held for sale and are being marketed for sale 
the transfer of these loans to held for sale resulted in an additional provision for loan losses of million and charge offs of million 
the company s pooled trust preferred securities portfolio was sold  resulting in a million gain 
this transaction also resulted in a significant reduction in risk weighted assets for regulatory capital purposes and the realization of a large portion of the company s deferred tax assets  with the monetization of much of that to occur in as part of this  thousand of additional tax expense needed to be recorded  which was related to the realization of the deferred tax assets to be carried back to the prior two years at a slightly lower tax rate compared to the tax rate as recorded 
all of the company s remaining held to maturity securities were transferred to available for sale 
the organization and set up of pgb trust investments of delaware was completed just prior to year end  resulting in legal fees of approximately thousand 
staffing and organizational restructuring coupled with various resignations  retirements  and position eliminations  resulted in the recording of a thousand severance accrual 
additionally  the fourth quarter of included thousand of costs and fee waivers as a result of hurricane sandy 
in january  the corporation repurchased the remaining million of the preferred stock sold to the us treasury in the capital purchase program cpp  and in april paid  to the treasury to repurchase the warrant previously issued in january under the cpp 
the warrant allowed purchase of up to  shares of the corporation s common stock

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the corporation s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the corporation to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note to the corporation s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   contains a summary of the corporation s significant accounting policies 

table of contents management believes that the corporation s policy with respect to the methodology for the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of complexity and requires management to make difficult and subjective judgments  which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
changes in these judgments  assumption or estimates could materially impact results of operations 
this critical policy and its application are periodically reviewed with the audit committee and the board of directors 
the provision for loan losses is based upon management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance  including an assessment of known and inherent risks in the portfolio  giving consideration to the size and composition of the loan portfolio  actual loan loss experience  level of delinquencies  detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectability may not be assured  the existence and estimated fair value of any underlying collateral and guarantees securing the loans  and current economic and market conditions 
although management uses the best information available  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate  which is subject to significant judgment and short term change 
various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the corporation s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the corporation to make additional provisions for loan losses based upon information available to them at the time of their examination 
furthermore  the majority of the corporation s loans are secured by real estate in the state of new jersey 
accordingly  the collectability of a substantial portion of the carrying value of the corporation s loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in local market conditions and may experience continuing adverse economic conditions 
future adjustments to the provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses may be necessary due to economic  operating  regulatory and other conditions beyond the corporation s control 
the corporation accounts for its securities in accordance with accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  which was codified into accounting standards codification asc debt securities are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and ability to hold them to maturity 
debt securities are classified as available for sale when they might be sold before maturity due to changes in interest rates  prepayment risk  liquidity or other factors 
securities available for sale are carried at fair value  with unrealized holding gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income  net of tax 
securities are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis to determine whether a decline in value is other than temporary 
to determine whether a decline in value is other than temporary  management considers the reasons underlying the decline  the near term prospects of the issuer  the extent and duration of the decline and whether it intends to sell  or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell  a security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
if either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met  the entire difference between amortized cost and fair value is recognized as impairment through earnings 
other than temporary is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent  but indicates that the prospects for a near term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable  or that there is a lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment 
once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the amount of the impairment is split into two components other than temporary impairment related to credit loss  which must be recognized through earnings 
no impairment charges were recognized in or for equity securities  the entire amount of impairment is recognized through earnings 
earnings summary the corporation recorded net income of million for the year ended december   and diluted earnings per share  including the effect of the preferred dividend  of compared to net income of million and diluted earnings per share  including the effect of the preferred dividend  of for the year ended december  these results produced a return on average assets of percent and percent in and  respectively  and a return on average common shareholders equity of percent in and percent in earnings for the year ended december  were reduced by the effects of the strategic initiatives detailed in the overview section above 
earnings for the year were benefitted by a state income tax benefit of million related to the reversal of a valuation allowance previously recorded in circumstances and projections indicated that the deferred tax asset would be realized in future periods and it was  in fact  realized upon the sale of the pooled trust preferred securities portfolio in the fourth quarter of  as noted previously in the overview section 
net interest income the primary source of the corporation s operating income is net interest income  which is the difference between interest and dividends earned on earning assets and fees earned on loans  and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
earning assets include loans to individuals and businesses  investment securities  interest earning deposits and federal funds sold 
interest bearing liabilities include interest bearing checking  savings and time deposits  federal home loan bank advances and other borrowings 
net interest income is determined by the difference between the yields earned on earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities net interest spread and the relative amounts of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the corporation s net interest spread is affected by regulatory  economic and competitive factors that influence interest rates  loan demand and deposit flows and general levels of nonperforming assets 

table of contents net interest income  on a fully tax equivalent basis  was million in  an increase of million  or percent  from s levels 
the corporation s net interest margin for and was percent and percent  respectively  reflecting an increase of three basis points 
net interest income and net interest margin reflected increases for when compared to  as the positive effect of increased loans  funded by reduced lower yielding investment securities and increased lower cost core deposits  was partially offset by the effect of lower market yields  which compressed asset yields more than deposit costs 
in  interest income on earning assets  on a fully tax equivalent basis  increased thousand at million compared to interest income remained relatively constant due to the increase in loan volumes which counteracted the decreases in rates earned on loans and investments and the decrease in investment volumes 
average earning assets for totaled billion compared to billion for  an increase of million or percent 
the average rate earned on earning assets was percent in  compared to percent in  a decline of basis points 
the decline in the average rates on earning assets was due to continued decreases to already very low market rates for all loan types in in  average investment securities totaled million  a decrease of million compared to the average yield was percent for average loan balances increased million  or percent  during to billion from million in the average yield on total loans was percent and percent in and  respectively  a decrease of basis points 
during  the average yield on the residential mortgage portfolio declined basis points to percent from percent in the average yield on the commercial mortgage loan portfolio was percent in  declined basis points from  while the average yield on commercial loans was percent  declining basis points in the average yield on home equity lines remained relatively constant when compared to at percent for and percent for average rates declined during the year due to lower market rates and competitive pressure experienced during for the years ended december  and  average interest bearing liabilities totaled billion and billion  respectively  reflecting an increase of million or percent from the average balance in  while the average rate paid declined to percent for from percent for the decline in the average rate on interest bearing liabilities was due to the sustained low in market rates in coupled with targeted growth of lower costing core deposits and continued run off of higher paying certificates of deposit 
the corporation s interest bearing checking accounts continued to grow during  and averaged million for the year  an increase of million  or percent  from during  the average rate paid on interest bearing checking accounts was percent  a decrease of basis points from the average rates paid in of percent 
for the years ended december  and  noninterest bearing checking accounts averaged million and million  respectively  increasing million or percent from s levels 
checking account growth is due to the corporation s relationship orientation as the corporation has successfully focused on business and personal core deposit generation  particularly checking  establishing municipal relationships within its market territory  and growth in deposits associated with its commercial mortgage and commercial loan growth 
in  average money market accounts totaled million  compared to million in  decreasing million or percent  from the decline in the corporation s money market deposits can be attributed to the lower rates on these products  which averaged percent and percent for the years ended december  and  respectively

the following portfolio classes have been identified a primary residential mortgages 
the bank originates one to four family residential mortgage loans within or near its primary geographic market area 
when reviewing residential mortgage loan applications  the bank obtains detailed verifiable information regarding income  assets and indebtedness  a credit report  and an independent appraisal of the property to be mortgaged 
the bank makes residential mortgage loans up to of the appraised value and up to with private mortgage insurance 
the bank uses lower loan to value ratios for large loans and loans on either second vacation homes or investment property 
the bank s underwriting guidelines include i minimum credit report scores of and ii a maximum debt to income ratio of if the loan to value is or higher and if the loan to value is less than 
the bank may consider an exception to any guideline if the remaining characteristics of the application are sufficiently strong to compensate 
the bank retains in its portfolio residential mortgage loans with maturities of up to years while loans with longer maturities are sold to third party financial institutions 
the bank does not originate  purchase or carry any sub prime mortgage loans 

table of contents primary risk characteristics associated with residential mortgage loans typically involve major living or lifestyle changes to the borrower  including unemployment or other loss of income  unexpected significant expenses  such as for major medical issues or catastrophic events  divorce or death 
in addition  residential mortgage loans that have adjustable rates could expose the borrower to higher debt service requirements in a rising interest rate environment 
further  real estate value could drop significantly and cause the value of the property to fall below the loan amount  creating additional potential exposure for the bank 
bank management believes that the underwriting guidelines previously described address the primary risk characteristics 
further  the bank has dedicated staff and system resources to monitor and collect on any potentially problematic residential mortgage loans 
b home equity lines of credit 
the bank provides revolving lines of credit against one to four family residences within or near its primary geographic market 
when reviewing residential mortgage loan applications  the bank obtains detailed verifiable information regarding income  assets and indebtedness  a credit report  and an independent appraisal of the property to be mortgaged 
for home equity lines of credit  the bank utilizes the same underwriting standards as for primary residential mortgages 
primary risk characteristics associated with home equity lines of credit typically involve major living or lifestyle changes to the borrower  including unemployment or other loss of income  unexpected significant expenses  such as for major medical issues or catastrophic events  divorce or death 
in addition  home equity lines of credit typically are made with variable or floating interest rates  such as the prime rate  which could expose the borrower to higher debt service requirements in a rising interest rate environment 
further  real estate value could drop significantly and cause the value of the property to fall below the loan amount  creating additional potential exposure for the bank 
bank management believes that the underwriting guidelines previously described address the primary risk characteristics 
further  the bank has dedicated staff and system resources to monitor and collect on any potentially problematic home equity lines of credit 
c junior lien loan on residence 
the bank provides junior lien loans jll against one to four family properties within or near its primary geographic market area 
junior liens loans can be either in the form of an amortizing home equity loan or a revolving home equity line of credit 
these loans are subordinate to a first mortgage which may be from another lending institution 
the bank will require that the mortgage securing the jll be no more junior than a second lien position 
the bank will evaluate these applications in the same manner as it underwrites primary residential mortgages 
the combined first mortgage and junior lien loan must be no more than of the appraised value of the property when the combined debt is less than or equal to  for jll amounts where the combined debt exceeds  the maximum loan to value ratio is 
primary risk characteristics associated with junior lien loans typically involve major living or lifestyle changes to the borrower  including unemployment or other loss of income  unexpected significant expenses  such as for major medical issues or catastrophic events  divorce or death 
further  real estate value could drop significantly and cause the value of the property to fall below the loan amount  creating additional potential exposure for the bank 
bank management believes that the underwriting guidelines previously described address the primary risk characteristics 
further  the bank has dedicated staff and system resources to monitor and collect on any potentially problematic junior lien loans 
d multifamily and commercial real estate loans 
the bank provides mortgage loans for multifamily properties ie buildings which have five or more residential units and other commercial real estate that is either owner occupied or managed as an investment property 
commercial real estate properties primarily include office and medical buildings  retail space  and warehouse or flex space 
some properties are considered mixed use as they are a combination of building types  such as an apartment building that may also have retail space 
in these cases the bank determines which component provides the majority of the rental income for the property and utilizes that component for the loan classification 
the terms and conditions of all commercial mortgage loans are tailored to the specific attributes of the borrower  the property or project  and any guarantors 
in the case of multifamily and investment commercial real estate properties  the bank reviews  among other things  the nature of and diversity of the underlying tenants and leases  the resources and experience of the sponsor  and the condition and location of the subject property 
with an owner occupied property  a detailed credit assessment is also made of the operating business 
while the bank s policy allows loan to value ratios of up to of an appraised value  the majority of the loans are originated at loan to value ratios of or lower 
commercial mortgage loans are generally made on a fixed rate basis with periodic rate resets every five or seven years over an underlying market index 
the bank requires an independent appraisal  a property conditions assessment from an engineering firm  and appropriate environmental due diligence 

table of contents multifamily loans are expected to be repaid from the cash flow of the underlying property so the collective amount of rents must be sufficient to cover all operating expenses  property management and maintenance  taxes and debt service 
increases in vacancy rates  interest rates or other changes in general economic conditions can all have an impact on the borrower and their ability to repay the loan 
commercial real estate loans are generally considered to have a higher degree of credit risk than multifamily loans as they may be dependent on the ongoing success and operating viability of a fewer number of tenants who are occupying the property and who may have a greater degree of exposure to economic conditions 
to mitigate this risk  the bank will require a standby assignment of leases  greater direct recourse to the owners  and a risk appropriate interest rate and loan structure 
in underwriting a commercial mortgage loan  the bank evaluates the property s historical operating income as well as its projected sustainability and generally requires a minimum debt service coverage ratio that provides for an adequate cushion for unexpected or uncertain future events such as the potential impact of changes in interest rates  vacancy levels and lease rates 
e commercial and industrial loans 
the bank provides lines of credit and term loans to operating companies for business purposes 
the loans are generally secured by business assets such as accounts receivable  inventory and equipment 
when underwriting business loans  among other things  the bank evaluates the historical profitability and debt servicing capacity of the borrowing entity and the financial resources and character of the principal owners and guarantors 
commercial and industrial loans are typically repaid first by the cash flow generated by the borrower s business operation 
the primary risk characteristics are specific to the underlying business and its ability to generate sustainable profitability and resulting positive cash flow 
factors that may influence a business s profitability include  but are not limited to  demand for its products or services  quality and depth of management  degree of competition  regulatory changes  and general economic conditions 
commercial and industrial loans are generally secured by business assets  however  the ability of the bank to foreclose and realize sufficient value from the assets is often highly uncertain 
to mitigate the risk characteristics of commercial and industrial loans  the bank will often require more frequent reporting requirements from the borrower in order to better monitor its business performance 
f agricultural production 
these are loans to finance agricultural production and other loans to farmers 
g commercial construction 
the bank has substantially wound down its commercial construction lending activity given the current economic environment 
new construction loans would be considered only to experienced and reputable local builders and developers that have the capital and liquidity to carry a project to completion and stabilization and for projects that are supported by either a permanent take out or acceptable executed leases or sales contracts 
when evaluating a construction loan request  the bank will also review the construction plans and drawings  costs estimates from architects  and an independent appraisal 
construction loans typically have a month period of interest only and at a maximum loan to value ratio 
construction loans are considered riskier than commercial financing on improved and established commercial real estate 
the risk of potential loss increases if the original cost estimates or time to complete are significantly off 
h consumer and other 
these are loans to individuals for household  family and other personal expenditures as well as obligations of states and political subdivisions in the us this also represents all other loans that cannot be categorized in any of the previous mentioned loan segments 
the provision was based upon management s review and evaluation of the size and composition of the loan portfolio  actual loan loss experience  level of delinquencies  general market and economic conditions  detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectability may not be assured  and the existence and fair value of the collateral and guarantees securing the loans 
although management used the best information available  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate  which is subject to significant judgment and short term change 
various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the corporation s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the corporation to make additional provisions for loan losses based upon information available to them at the time of their examination 
furthermore  the majority of the corporation s loans are secured by real estate in the state of new jersey 
accordingly  the collectability of a substantial portion of the carrying value of the corporation s loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in market conditions in the state and may be adversely affected should real estate values decline further or new jersey experience continuing adverse economic conditions 
future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary due to economic  operating  regulatory and other conditions beyond the corporation s control

the commercial real estate portfolio generally carries a higher allocation of general allowance for loan losses

the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans increased  as the level of nonperforming loans also decreased during the year 
nonperforming loans are specifically evaluated for impairment 
also  management commonly records partial charge offs of the excess of the principal balance over the net realizable value of collateral for collateral dependent impaired loans  as a result  the allowance for loan losses does not always change proportionately with changes in nonperforming loans 
management charged off million on loans identified as collateral dependent impaired loans during during the fourth quarter of  approximately million of classified loans were transferred to loans held for sale and are being marketed for sale 
the transfer of these loans to held for sale resulted in an additional provision for loan losses of million and charge offs of million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk asset liability management the corporation s asset liability committee alco is responsible for developing  implementing and or monitoring asset liability management strategies and reports and advising the board of directors on such  as well as the related level of interest rate risk 
in this regard  interest rate risk simulation models are prepared on a quarterly basis 
these models have the ability to demonstrate balance sheet gaps  and predict changes to net interest income and economic market value of portfolio equity under various interest rate scenarios 
alco is generally authorized to manage interest rate risk through management of capital and management of cash flows and duration of assets and liabilities  including sales and purchases of assets  as well as additions of wholesale borrowings 
the following strategies are among those used to manage interest rate risk actively market adjustable rate and or shorter term residential mortgage loans  actively market commercial mortgage loans  which tend to have shorter terms and higher interest rates than residential mortgage loans  and which generate customer relationships that can result in higher core deposit accounts  actively sell longer duration mortgages in the current low rate environment  actively market core deposit relationships  which are generally longer duration liabilities  closely monitor and actively manage the investment portfolio  including management of duration  prepayment and interest rate risk  and maintain adequate levels of capital 
at this time  the corporation is not engaged in hedging through the use of derivatives nor does it use interest rate caps and floors 

table of contents as noted above  alco uses simulation modeling to analyze the corporation s net interest income sensitivity  as well as the corporation s economic value of portfolio equity under various interest rate scenarios 
the model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the model incorporates certain prepayment and interest rate assumptions  which management believes to be reasonable as of december  the model assumes changes in interest rates without any proactive change in the balance sheet by management 
in the model  the forecasted shape of the yield curve remains static as of december  in an immediate and sustained basis point increase in market rates at december   net interest income for would decline approximately percent while net interest income for would improve approximately percent  compared to a flat interest rate scenario 
in an immediate and sustained basis point decrease in market rates at december   net interest income would decline approximately percent for and percent for  compared to a flat interest rate scenario 
the table below shows the estimated changes in the corporation s economic value of portfolio equity evpe that would result from an immediate parallel change in the market interest rates at december  estimated increase evpe as a percentage of dollars in thousands decrease in evpe present value of assets change in interest rates estimated evpe increase decrease basis points evpe amount percent ratio basis points flat interest rates  evpe is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets and liabilities 
present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest earning assets 
evpe ratio represents evpe divided by the present value of assets 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in determining interest rate risk 
simulation modeling requires making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the modeling assumes that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assume that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the information provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results
