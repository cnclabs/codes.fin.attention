risk factors included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we develop  design  manufacture and service custom engineered to order equipment and systems for the management and control of electrical energy and other critical processes 
headquartered in houston  texas  we serve the transportation  environmental  energy  industrial and utility industries 
our business operations are consolidated into two business segments electrical power products and process control systems 
revenues and costs are primarily related to custom engineered to order equipment and systems which precludes us from providing detailed price and volume information 
the markets in which we participate are capital intensive and cyclical in nature 
cyclicality is predominantly driven by customer demand  global economic conditions and anticipated environmental or regulatory changes which affect the manner in which our customers proceed with capital investments 
our customers analyze various factors including the demand for oil  gas and electrical energy  the overall financial environment  governmental budgets  regulatory actions and environmental concerns 
these factors influence the release of new capital projects by our customers  which are traditionally awarded in competitive bid situations 
scheduling is matched to the customer requirements and projects may take a number of months to produce  schedules also may change during the course of any particular project 
our operating results are impacted by factors outside of our control  for example  many of our projects have contracting arrangements where the approval of engineering and design specifications may affect the timing of the project execution 
as of september   our order backlog strengthened with unfilled orders of million  an increase of approximately million over the beginning of this fiscal year 
our backlog includes various projects  some of which are petrochemical  oil and gas construction and transportation infrastructure projects which take a number of months to produce 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recovered approximately million related to one large project at powell canada  of which approximately million was recorded as revenue and the remaining million was related to amounts recorded to other assets in prior periods 
this recovery related to cost overruns on a large project with execution challenges in the first half of fiscal which negatively impacted revenue and gross profit in fiscal in our electrical power products segment 
results of operations twelve months ended september  compared to twelve months ended september  revenue and gross profit consolidated revenues decreased  or million  to million in fiscal domestic revenues decreased by  or million  to million in fiscal and international revenues decreased  or million  to million in fiscal gross profit increased  or million  to million in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal operating results by segment are discussed below 
electrical power products electrical power products business segment revenues decreased  or million  to million in fiscal revenues decreased primarily due to the completion of certain complex domestic and international petrochemical and oil and gas construction projects that were in process during fiscal however  revenues in fiscal were favorably impacted by the recovery of million related to cost overruns on a large industrial project at powell canada 
this canadian project experienced execution challenges in the first half of fiscal  which negatively impacted revenue and gross profit in fiscal revenues from public and private utilities increased million to million in fiscal revenues from commercial and industrial customers decreased million to million in fiscal revenues from municipal and transit projects decreased million to million in fiscal electrical power products business segment gross profit increased  or million  to million in fiscal gross profit  as a percentage of revenues  increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal these increases were primarily driven by the recovery from the canadian contract settlement discussed above  the margins associated with the mix of projects in process during fiscal and  as well as the increased focus on cost reduction activities 
process control systems process control systems business segment revenues increased  or million  to million in fiscal this revenue increase has been driven by the increase in projects that were awarded during fiscal primarily from municipal and transit customers 
business segment gross profit  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to for fiscal  compared to for fiscal this decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to the overall mix of project types 
for additional information related to our business segments  see note l of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenues  increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase is primarily related to increased personnel costs and increased long term incentive compensation resulting from higher levels of operating performance over the three year performance cycle 
this increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was offset by a decrease in depreciation expense as our business systems became fully depreciated in december additionally  selling  general and administrative costs for fiscal were favorably impacted by the capitalization of certain personnel costs in fiscal associated with the development and implementation of our new business systems 
however  the favorable impact of depreciation expense and capitalization of certain personnel costs will no longer be realized once the business systems are implemented in our fiscal year ending september  amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets decreased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  as certain intangible assets have become fully amortized 
restructuring and relocation costs during fiscal  we recorded restructuring and relocation charges totaling million 
these charges were related to our electrical power products business segment 
we have incurred approximately million in fiscal related to relocation efforts in connection with the construction of our new facility in houston  texas and our new facility in acheson  alberta  canada 
these costs were primarily related to the relocation of our operations  the loss on the sublease  and the abandonment of leasehold improvements on the previously occupied facilities in the second half of fiscal the construction of our two new facilities was substantially completed in september and we have relocated the majority of our operations and personnel from their previously leased facilities 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded and paid million related to severance at our united kingdom operations 
these operations were negatively impacted by market conditions and competitive pressures in the international markets in which they operate  therefore  we exited certain non core operations and eliminated certain positions to better align our workforce with current market conditions 
gain on settlement in march  we settled a lawsuit we had filed against the previous owners of powell canada in the amount of million  which was received in april income tax provision our provision for income taxes reflected an effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes of in fiscal compared to in fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal has been favorably impacted by the release of the million valuation allowance recorded as an offset to the prior years canadian pre tax losses 
we believe that it is more likely than not that the market conditions and our operating results going forward will allow us to realize the deferred tax assets associated with the prior year losses in canada 
the rate for fiscal was also favorably impacted by the federal research and development tax credit and the utilization of certain foreign tax credits 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was negatively impacted by our inability to record a tax benefit related to pre tax losses in canada 
for further information on the effective tax rate for fiscal  see note h of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
net income loss in fiscal  we recorded net income of million  or earnings of per diluted share compared to net income of million  or earnings of per diluted share in fiscal net income in fiscal was positively impacted by the recovery of million from the canadian contract settlement and the favorable tax benefits discussed above 
backlog the order backlog at september   was million  compared to million at september  new orders placed during fiscal totaled million compared to million in fiscal the backlog for fiscal has increased primarily due to continued strength in oil and gas production projects  refining projects and transportation markets 
twelve months ended september  compared to twelve months ended september  revenue and gross profit consolidated revenues increased  or million  to million in fiscal domestic revenues increased by  or million  to million in fiscal and international revenues increased  or million  to million in fiscal revenues increased primarily as a result of an increase in activity in complex petrochemical and oil and gas construction projects  as a result of our electrical power products business segment 
gross profit in fiscal increased  or million  to million in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal  primarily as a result of our electrical power products business segment 
operating results by segment are discussed below 
electrical power products electrical power products business segment revenues increased  or million  to million in fiscal revenues increased primarily as a result of an increase in project activity in certain markets 
revenues from public and private utilities decreased million to million in fiscal revenues from commercial and industrial customers increased million to million in fiscal revenues from municipal and transit projects increased million to in fiscal electrical power products business segment gross profit increased  or million  to million in fiscal gross profit  as a percentage of revenues  increased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal  as a result of favorable operational execution and project management on certain large complex projects that were completed or near completion 
our increase in project activity in fiscal also improved our ability to cover fixed and overhead operating costs  partially offset by the challenges on certain large projects at powell canada 
these challenges resulted from scope changes and cost overruns on certain canadian projects 
we recovered certain of these costs in fiscal process control systems process control systems business segment revenues increased  or million  to million in fiscal business segment gross profit  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to for fiscal  compared to for fiscal this decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues is related to the mix of project types 
for additional information related to our business segments  see note l of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues in fiscal as a result of our increase in revenues 
consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million in fiscal this increase is primarily related to increased personnel costs and incentive compensation resulting from higher levels of operating performance 
additionally  separation payments of million to our former ceo were recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets decreased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal this decrease resulted from the impairment of the intangible assets recorded in fiscal related to powell canada 
income tax provision our provision for income taxes reflected an effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes of in fiscal compared to in fiscal the effective tax rate for both fiscal and were negatively impacted by our inability to record the tax benefit related to pre tax losses in canada  offset by the favorable impact on our effective tax rate of the domestic production activities deduction in the united states 
for further information on the effective tax rate for fiscal  see note h of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
net income loss in fiscal  we recorded net income of million  or earnings of per diluted share  compared to a net loss of million  or a loss of per diluted share  in fiscal net income improved in fiscal as a result of increased revenue and earnings from increased activity and favorable operational and project execution in fiscal fiscal was negatively impacted by the impairment of intangible assets for powell canada of million  the million separation charge with our former ceo and our inability to record the tax benefits related to the pre tax losses in canada 
backlog the order backlog at september   was million  compared to million at september  new orders placed during fiscal totaled million compared to million in fiscal the backlog for fiscal decreased slightly due to the completion of certain complex oil and gas production and petrochemical projects 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents increased to million at september   compared to million at september  this increase in cash primarily resulted from cash flow provided by operations of million 
these cash flows were partially used to fund the construction of our two new facilities in the united states and canada in fiscal in order to support continued expansion in our key markets 
as of september   current assets exceeded current liabilities by times and our debt to total capitalization ratio was 
we have a million revolving credit facility in the us  which expires in december as of september   there were no amounts borrowed under this line of credit 
we also have a million revolving credit facility in canada 
at september   there was no balance outstanding under the canadian revolving credit facility 
total long term debt and capital lease obligations  including current maturities  totaled million at september   compared to million at september  total letters of credit outstanding were million and million at september  and  respectively  which reduce our availability under our us credit facility and our canadian revolving credit facility 
amounts available at september  under the us and canadian revolving credit facilities were million and million  respectively 
for further information regarding our debt  see notes g and j of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
approximately million of our cash at september  was held outside of the united states for international operations 
it is our intention to indefinitely reinvest all current and future foreign earnings internationally in order to ensure sufficient working capital and support and expand these international operations 
in the event that we elect to repatriate some or all of the foreign earnings that were previously deemed to be indefinitely reinvested outside the us  under current tax laws we would incur additional tax expense upon such repatriation 
we believe that cash available and borrowing capacity under our existing credit facilities should be sufficient to finance anticipated operating activities  capital improvements and expansions  as well as debt repayments  for the foreseeable future 
we continue to monitor the factors that drive our markets and strive to maintain our leadership and competitive advantage in the markets we serve while aligning our cost structures with market conditions 
operating activities during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million 
during fiscal  net cash used in operating activities was million and in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million 
cash flow from operations is primarily influenced by demand for our products and services and is impacted as our progress payment terms with our customers are matched with the payment terms with our suppliers 
during fiscal  our cash from operations increased over fiscal  primarily due to increased net income  as well as the increase in billing in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts and the collection of contracts receivable based on the progress billing milestones 
additionally in fiscal  we received million in contract settlements related to fiscal matters 
during fiscal  the cash used in operations of million was primarily the result of increased unbilled contract receivables based on progress billing milestones 
cash flow provided by operations of million in fiscal resulted primarily from the increase in accounts payable 
investing activities purchases of property  plant and equipment during fiscal totaled million compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
a significant portion of the investments in the last two fiscal years was to acquire land and build facilities in the united states and canada to support our continued expansion in our key markets  including the oil and gas markets and canadian oil sands region 
costs related to upgrades and enhancements to our business systems were also incurred during fiscal  which are expected to be placed into service in the second quarter of our fiscal year ending september  financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was million during fiscal due to cash being received from the exercise of stock options 
net cash used in financing activities was million during fiscal contractual and other obligations at september   our long term contractual obligations were limited to debt and leases 
the table below details our commitments by type of obligation  including interest if applicable  and the period that the payment will become due in thousands 
as of september   payments due by period long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total less than year to years to years more than years total long term contractual obligations the lease on our previously occupied canadian facility does not expire until july  however  we have sublet that facility through july as of september   the total unrecognized tax benefit related to uncertain tax positions was million 
we estimate that none of this will be paid within the next months 
however  we believe that it is reasonably possible that within the next months  the total unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately due to the expiration of certain statutes of limitations in various state and local jurisdictions 
we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates regarding the timing of future cash outflows  if any  associated with the remaining unrecognized tax benefits 
other commercial commitments we are contingently liable for secured and unsecured letters of credit of million as of september   of which million reduces our borrowing capacity 
the following table reflects potential cash outflows that may result in the event that we are unable to perform under our contracts in thousands as of september   payments due by period letters of credit less than year to years to years more than years total long term commercial obligations we also had performance and maintenance bonds totaling million that were outstanding at september  performance and maintenance bonds are primarily used to guarantee contract performance to our customers 
outlook powell participates in capital intensive markets that are cyclical in nature 
cyclicality is predominantly driven by customer demand  global economic conditions and anticipated environmental or regulatory changes which affect the manner in which our customers proceed with capital investments 
market cycles are many months or years in length and require our customers to analyze factors which include the demand for oil  gas and electrical energy  the overall financial environment  governmental budgets  the outlook for regulatory actions and environmental concerns 
orders take a number of months to produce and are traditionally awarded in competitive bid situations 
scheduling is matched to the customer requirements which may change during the course of any particular project 
growth in demand for energy is expected to continue over the long term 
this  when coupled with the need for replacement of existing infrastructure that is at the end of its life cycle  demonstrates a continued need for products and services produced by us 
our orders over the past year have been solid  driven primarily by continued strength in oil and gas production projects  refining projects and transportation markets 
we continue to experience timing challenges in the near term related to the awarding of large projects due to various global market conditions and industry constraints 
however  the outlook for continued opportunities for our products and services remains positive  even though the timing and pricing of many of these projects are difficult to predict 
our operating results are frequently impacted by the timing and resolution of change orders and project close out which could cause gross margins to improve or deteriorate during the period in which these items are approved and finalized with customers 
our operating results are also impacted by factors outside of our control  such as our projects that have contract arrangements where the approval of engineering and design specifications may affect the timing of the project execution 
strength in the canadian oil sands region continues to be a major contributor to our improved operations and backlog in canada 
the relocation to our newly constructed facility and the ramp up  staffing and expansion of our operations in canada pose various risks and uncertainties in the near term 
we believe that cash available and borrowing capacity under our existing credit facility should be sufficient to finance anticipated operational activities  capital improvements and debt repayments for the foreseeable future 
we continue to monitor our markets and will strive to maintain our leadership and competitive advantage in the markets we serve while aligning our cost structures with market conditions 
effects of inflation we are subject to inflation  which can cause increases in our costs of raw materials  primarily copper  aluminum and steel 
fixed price contracts can limit our ability to pass these increases to our customers  thus negatively impacting our earnings 
the inflation in commodity prices could potentially impact our operations in our fiscal year ending september  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies and estimates to be critical in the preparation and reporting of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues are primarily generated from the engineering and manufacturing of custom products under long term contracts that may last from one month to several years  depending on the contract 
revenues from long term contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting 
occasionally a contract may require that we segment the project into specific deliverables for revenue recognition 
segmenting a contract may result in different interim rates of profitability for each scope of service than if we had recognized revenue on a combined basis 
under the percentage of completion method of accounting  revenues are recognized as work is performed 
the estimated completion to date is calculated by multiplying the total contract price by the percentage of performance to date  which is based on total costs or total labor dollars incurred to date compared to the total estimated costs or total labor dollars estimated at completion 
the method used to determine the percentage of completion is typically the cost method  unless the labor method is a more accurate method of measuring the progress of the project 
application of the percentage of completion method of accounting requires the use of estimates of costs to be incurred for the performance of the contract 
contract costs include all direct material costs  direct labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  tools  repairs and all costs associated with operation of equipment 
the cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our engineers  project managers and financial professionals 
factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability and productivity of labor  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the effect of change orders  the availability of materials  the effect of any delays on our project performance and the recoverability of any claims 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated profitability and final contract settlements  including our estimate of liquidated damages  if any  may result in revisions to costs and income  with their effects being recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
whenever revisions of estimated contract costs and contract values indicate that the contract costs will exceed estimated revenues  thus creating a loss  a provision for the total estimated loss is recorded in that period 
revenues associated with maintenance  repair and service contracts are recognized when the services are performed 
expenses related to these types of services are recognized as incurred 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts also include certain costs associated with unapproved change orders 
these costs are included when change order approval is probable 
amounts are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
revenue is recognized to the extent of costs incurred when recovery is probable 
the amounts recorded involve the use of judgments and estimates  thus  actual recoverable amounts could differ from original assumptions 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain and continually assess the adequacy of an allowance for doubtful accounts representing our estimate for losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay amounts due to us 
this estimated allowance is based on historical experience of uncollected accounts  the level of past due accounts  the overall level of outstanding accounts receivable  information about specific customers with respect to their inability to make payments and expectations of future conditions that could impact the collectability of accounts receivable 
however  future changes in our customers operating performance and cash flows  or in general economic conditions  could have an impact on their ability to fully pay these amounts  which  among other things  could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be realizable 
if an evaluation is required  the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the asset s carrying amount to determine if an impairment of such asset is necessary 
this requires us to make long term forecasts of the future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
forecasts require assumptions about demand for our products and future market conditions 
estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment  and our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized 
future events and unanticipated changes to assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
the effect of any impairment would be reflected in income loss from operations in the consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  we estimate the useful lives of our long lived assets and other intangibles and periodically review these estimates to determine whether these lives are appropriate 
intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized  but are evaluated for impairment annually  or immediately if conditions indicate that impairment could exist 
the evaluation requires a two step impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss 
the first step of the test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss 
both steps of the goodwill impairment testing involve significant estimates 
the costs of intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
when certain events or changes in operating conditions occur  an impairment assessment is performed and the lives of intangible assets with determinable lives may be adjusted 
see note d of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for a discussion of our impairment recorded in relation to the acquisition of powell canada 
accruals for contingent liabilities from time to time  contingencies such as insurance  liquidated damages and legal claims arise in the normal course of business 
pursuant to current accounting standards  we must evaluate such contingencies to subjectively determine the likelihood that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements  as well as evaluate whether the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
if the likelihood is determined to be probable and it can be reasonably estimated  the estimated loss is recorded 
the amounts we record for insurance claims  warranties  legal and other contingent liabilities require judgments regarding the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred 
we use past experience and history  as well as the specific circumstances surrounding each contingent liability  in evaluating the amount of liability that should be recorded 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
warranty costs we provide for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale based upon historical rates applicable to individual product lines 
in addition  specific provisions are made when the costs of such warranties are expected to exceed accruals 
our standard terms and conditions of sale include a warranty for parts and service for the earlier of months from the date of shipment or months from the date of initial operations 
occasionally projects require warranty terms that are longer than our standard terms due to the nature of the project 
extended warranty terms may be negotiated and included in our contracts 
we use past experience and historical claims to determine the estimated liability 
actual results could differ from our estimate 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  based on the income tax laws and rates in the countries in which operations are conducted and income is earned 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
developing our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment and expertise in federal  international and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  if necessary  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we believe that the net deferred tax asset recorded as of september   is realizable through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income 
if we were to subsequently determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to deferred tax assets would increase earnings for the period in which such determination was made 
we will continue to assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  and income tax disclosures 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial statements 
see note h of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for disclosures related to the valuation allowance recorded in relation to foreign deferred taxes 
foreign currency translation the functional currency for our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency in which the entity is located 
the financial statements of all subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar have been translated into us dollars 
all assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into us dollars using year end exchange rates  and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates during the respective period 
the us dollar results that arise from such translation  as well as exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances of a long term investment nature  are included in the cumulative currency translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
new accounting pronouncements from time to time  new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board the fasb  which are adopted by us as of the specified effective date 
unless otherwise discussed  management believes that the impact of recently issued standards  which are not yet effective  will not have a material impact on our consolidated statements upon adoption 
in august  the securities and exchange commission sec adopted a rule mandated by the wall street reform and consumer protection act to require companies to publicly disclose their use of conflict minerals that originate in the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country 
the final rule applies to a company that uses minerals including tantalum  tin  gold or tungsten 
the final rule requires companies to provide disclosure on a new form filed with the sec  with the first specialized disclosure report due on may   for the calendar year  and annually on may each year thereafter 
we are implementing the processes and procedures to comply with this rule 
in february  the fasb issued accounting guidance that requires companies to provide information regarding the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
a company will be required to present  either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income  but only if the amount reclassified is required by us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for other amounts that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  a company is required to cross reference to other disclosures required under us gaap that provide additional detail regarding those amounts 
this accounting guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after december   on a prospective basis 
we are evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements  but since the guidance only affects presentation and disclosure of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  the adoption of this guidance in our first quarter of fiscal year is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued accounting guidance to resolve the diversity in practice for accounting for the release of the cumulative translation adjustment into net income when a parent either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or a business other than a sale of real estate or conveyance of oil and gas mineral rights within a foreign entity 
this guidance is effective prospectively for fiscal years and interim reporting periods within those years beginning after december   our fiscal year ended september  we do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued accounting guidance on the presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward  a similar tax loss  or a tax credit carryforward exists 
the guidance states that an unrecognized tax benefit  or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit  should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward  a similar tax loss  or a tax credit carryforward 
to the extent a net operating loss carryforward  a similar tax loss  or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position or the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction does not require the entity to use  and the entity does not intend to use  the deferred tax asset for such purpose  the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   our fiscal year ended september  this guidance should be applied prospectively to all unrecognized tax benefits that exist at the effective date 
retrospective application is permitted 
the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions we have entered into in the normal course of business 
these risks primarily relate to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
interest rate risk if we decide to borrow under one of our credit facilities  we will be subject to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates related to our floating rate bank credit facility 
if we were to make such borrowings  a hypothetical basis point increase in variable interest rates may result in a material impact to our financial statements 
while we do not currently have any derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk  in the past we have entered and may in the future enter into such contracts 
during each of the past three years  we have not experienced a significant effect on our business due to changes in interest rates 
foreign currency transaction risk we have operations that expose us to currency risk in the british pound sterling  the canadian dollar and to a lesser extent the euro 
amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity in our consolidated balance sheets 
we believe the exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because the foreign operations primarily invoice customers and collect obligations in their respective currencies or us dollars 
our international operations are financed utilizing local credit facilities denominated in local currencies 
additionally  expenses associated with these transactions are generally contracted and paid for in the same local currencies 
a unfavorable change in the us dollar exchange rate  relative to other functional currencies in which we operate  would not materially impact our consolidated balance sheet at september  during fiscal  we entered into eight foreign currency forward contracts to manage the volatility of future cash flows on certain long term contracts that are denominated in the british pound sterling 
the contracts were designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 
the changes in fair value related to the effective portion of the hedges are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheets 
at september   all foreign currency forward contracts have been settled  with no balances recorded on our consolidated balance sheets related to these transactions
