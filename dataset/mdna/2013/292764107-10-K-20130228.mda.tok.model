item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to the historical information  the discussion contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements due to applications of our critical accounting policies and factors including  but not limited to  those set forth under the caption risk factors in item a of part i of this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading provider of energy management applications  services and products for the smart grid  which include comprehensive demand response  data driven energy efficiency and energy price and risk management applications  services and products 
our energy management applications  services and products enable cost effective energy management strategies for our c i  electric power grid operator and utility customers by reducing real time demand for electricity  increasing energy efficiency and improving energy supply transparency 
we believe that we are the world s leading provider of demand response applications and services 
demand response is an alternative to traditional power generation and transmission infrastructure projects that enables electric power grid operators and utilities to reduce the likelihood of service disruptions  such as brownouts and blackouts  during periods of peak electricity demand  and otherwise manage the electric power grid during short term imbalances of supply and demand or during periods when energy prices are high 
we build on our position as a leading demand response services provider by using our noc and energy management application platform to deliver a portfolio of additional energy management applications  services and products to new and existing c i  electric power grid operator and utility customers 
these additional energy management applications  services and products include our efficiencysmart and supplysmart applications and services  and certain wireless energy management products 
efficiencysmart is our data driven energy efficiency suite that includes energy efficiency planning  audits  assessments  commissioning and retro commissioning authority services  and a cloud based energy analytics application used for managing energy across a c i customer s portfolio of sites 
the cloud based energy analytics application also includes the ability to integrate with a c i customer s existing energy management system  provide utility bill management and tools for measurement  tracking  analysis  reporting and management of greenhouse gas emissions 
supplysmart is our energy price and risk management application that provides our c i customers located in restructured or deregulated markets throughout the united states with the ability to more effectively manage the energy supplier selection process  including energy supply product procurement and implementation  budget forecasting  and utility bill management 
our wireless energy management products are designed to ensure that our c i customers can connect their equipment remotely and access meter data securely  and include both cellular modems and an agricultural specific wireless technology solution acquired as part of our acquisition of mm in january since inception  our business has grown substantially 
we began by providing demand response services in one state in and have expanded to providing our portfolio of energy management applications  services and products in several regions throughout the united states  as well as internationally in australia  canada  new zealand and the united kingdom 

table of contents revenues and expense components revenues we derive recurring revenues from the sale of our energy management applications  services and products 
we do not recognize any revenues until persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and we deem collection to be reasonably assured 
our revenues from our demand response services primarily consist of capacity and energy payments  including ancillary services payments  and revenues derived from the effective management of our portfolio of demand response capacity  including our participation in capacity auctions and bilateral contracts 
we derive revenues from demand response capacity that we make available in open market programs and pursuant to contracts that we enter into with electric power grid operators and utilities 
in certain markets  we enter into contracts with electric power grid operators and utilities  generally ranging from three to ten years in duration  to deploy our demand response services 
we refer to these contracts as utility contracts 
where we operate in open market programs  our revenues from demand response capacity payments may vary month to month based upon our enrolled capacity and the market payment rate 
where we have a utility contract  we receive periodic capacity payments  which may vary monthly or seasonally  based upon enrolled capacity and predetermined payment rates 
under both open market programs and utility contracts  we receive capacity payments regardless of whether we are called upon to reduce demand for electricity from the electric power grid  and we recognize revenue over the applicable delivery period  even when payments are made over a different period 
we generally demonstrate our capacity either through a demand response event or a measurement and verification test 
this demonstrated capacity is typically used to calculate the continuing periodic capacity payments to be made to us until the next demand response event or measurement and verification test establishes a new demonstrated capacity amount 
in most cases  we also receive an additional payment for the amount of energy usage that we actually curtail from the grid during a demand response event 
we refer to this as an energy payment 
as program rules may differ for each open market program in which we participate and for each utility contract  we assess whether or not we have met the specific service requirements under the program rules and recognize or defer revenues as necessary 
we recognize demand response capacity revenues when we have provided verification to the electric power grid operator or utility of our ability to deliver the committed capacity under the open market program or utility contract 
committed capacity is verified through the results of an actual demand response event or a measurement and verification test 
once the capacity amount has been verified  the revenues are recognized and future revenues become fixed or determinable and are recognized monthly over the performance period until the next demand response event or measurement and verification test 
in subsequent demand response events or measurement and verification tests  if our verified capacity is below the previously verified amount  the electric power grid operator or utility customer will reduce future payments based on the adjusted verified capacity amounts 
under certain utility contracts and open market program participation rules  our performance and related fees are measured and determined over a period of time 
if we can reliably estimate our performance for the applicable performance period  we will reserve the entire amount of estimated penalties that will be incurred  if any  as a result of estimated underperformance prior to the commencement of revenue recognition 
if we are unable to reliably estimate the performance and any related penalties  we defer the recognition of revenues until the fee is fixed or determinable 
any changes to our original estimates of net revenues are recognized as a change in accounting estimate in the earliest reporting period that such a change is determined 
as of december   we had over  mw in our demand response network  meaning that we had entered into definitive contracts with our c i customers representing over  mw of demand response capacity 
in determining our mw in the seasonal demand response programs in which we participate  we typically count the maximum determinable amount of curtailable load for a c i customer site over a trailing twelve month period as the mw for that c i customer site 
however  the trailing period could be longer in certain programs under which significant rule changes have occurred or under which we do not have enough obligation to enroll all of our mw in a given program period  but have enough obligation in a future program 
table of contents period to enroll those mw 
we generally begin earning revenues from our mw within approximately one to three months from the date on which we enable the mw  or the date on which we can reduce the mw from the electric power grid if called upon to do so 
the most significant exception is the pjm forward capacity market  which is a market from which we derive a substantial portion of our revenues 
because pjm operates on a june to may program year basis  the revenues associated with a mw that we enable after june of each year will typically not be recognized until september of the following year 
certain other markets in which we currently participate  such as the western australia market and iso ne market  or may choose to participate in the future  operate or may operate in a manner that could create a delay in recognizing revenue from the mw that we enable in those markets 
in the pjm open market program in which we participate  the program year operates on a june to may basis and performance is measured based on the aggregate performance during the months of june through september 
as a result  fees received for the month of june could potentially be subject to adjustment or refund based on performance during the months of july through september 
based on changes to certain pjm program rules during the year ended december   or fiscal  we concluded that we no longer had the ability to reliably estimate the amount of fees potentially subject to adjustment or refund until the performance period ends on september th of each year 
therefore  commencing in fiscal  all demand response capacity revenues related to our participation in the pjm open market program are being recognized at the end of the performance period  or during the three months ended september th of each year 
as a result of the fact that the period during which we are required to perform june through september is shorter than the period over which we receive payments under the program june through may  a portion of the revenues that have been earned will be recorded and accrued as unbilled revenue 
our revenues have historically been higher in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year due to seasonality related to the demand response market 
we expect  based on the fact that we recognize demand response capacity revenue related to our participation in the pjm open market program during the three months ended september th of each year  that our revenues will typically be higher in the third quarter as compared to any other quarter in our fiscal year 
revenues generated from open market sales to pjm accounted for  and respectively  of our total revenues for the years ended december   and under certain utility contracts and open market programs  such as pjm s emergency load response program  the period during which we are required to perform may be shorter than the period over which we receive payments under that contract or program 
in these cases  we record revenue  net of reserves for estimated penalties related to potential delivered capacity shortfalls  over the mandatory performance obligation period  and a portion of the revenues that have been earned is recorded and accrued as unbilled revenue 
our unbilled revenue of million from pjm as of december  will be billed and collected through june our unbilled revenue of million as of december  was collected through june revenues generated from open market sales to iso ne accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenues for the years ended december   and other than pjm and iso ne  no individual electric power grid operator or utility customers accounted for more than of our total revenues for the years ended december   and if we choose to participate in additional or different markets in the future  the contribution of our current electric power grid operator and utility customers to total revenues will change 
with respect to our efficiencysmart and supplysmart applications and services  these applications and services generally represent ongoing service arrangements where the revenues are recognized ratably over the service period commencing upon delivery of the contracted service to the customer 
under certain of our arrangements  in particular certain efficiencysmart arrangements with our utility customers  a portion of the fees received may be subject to adjustment or refund based on the validation of the energy savings delivered after the implementation is complete 
as a result  we defer the portion of the fees that are subject to adjustment or refund until such time as the right of adjustment or refund lapses  which is generally upon completion and validation of the implementation 
in addition  under certain of our other arrangements  in particular those arrangements entered into by our wholly owned subsidiary  mm  we sell proprietary equipment to c i 
table of contents customers that is utilized to provide the ongoing services that we deliver 
currently  this equipment has been determined to not have stand alone value 
as a result  we defer the fees associated with the equipment and begin recognizing those fees ratably over the expected c i customer relationship period  which is generally years  once the c i customer is receiving the ongoing services from us 
in addition  we capitalize the associated direct and incremental costs  which primarily represent the equipment and third party installation costs  and recognize such costs over the expected c i customer relationship period 
revenues derived from efficiencysmart and supplysmart applications and services  and certain other wireless energy management products were million  million and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and cost of revenues cost of revenues for our demand response services primarily consists of amounts owed to our c i customers for their participation in our demand response network and are generally recognized over the same performance period as the corresponding revenue 
we enter into contracts with our c i customers under which we deliver recurring cash payments to them for the capacity they commit to make available on demand 
we also generally make an energy payment when a c i customer reduces consumption of energy from the electric power grid during a demand response event 
the equipment and installation costs for our devices located at our c i customer sites  which monitor energy usage  communicate with c i customer sites and  in certain instances  remotely control energy usage to achieve committed capacity are capitalized and depreciated over the lesser of the remaining estimated customer relationship period or the estimated useful life of the equipment  and this depreciation is reflected in cost of revenues 
we also include in cost of revenues our amortization of acquired developed technology  amortization of capitalized internal use software costs related to our demandsmart application  the monthly telecommunications and data costs we incur as a result of being connected to c i customer sites  and our internal payroll and related costs allocated to a c i customer site 
certain costs  such as equipment depreciation and telecommunications and data costs  are fixed and do not vary based on revenues recognized 
these fixed costs could impact our gross margin trends described elsewhere in this annual report on form k during interim periods 
cost of revenues for our efficiencysmart and supplysmart applications and services  and certain other wireless energy management products includes our amortization of capitalized internal use software costs related to those applications  services and products  third party services  equipment costs  equipment depreciation  and the wages and associated benefits that we pay to our project managers for the performance of their services 
we defer incremental direct costs incurred related to the acquisition or origination of a utility contract or open market program in a transaction that results in the deferral or delay of revenue recognition 
as of december  and  we had no incremental direct costs deferred related to the acquisition or origination of a utility contract or open market program and during the years ended december   and  no contract origination costs were deferred 
during the year ended december   as a result of the termination of a certain contract  million of previously deferred incremental direct costs were expensed 
in addition  we defer incremental direct costs incurred related to customer contracts where the associated revenues have been deferred as long as the deferred incremental direct costs are deemed realizable 
during the years ended december   and  we deferred million  million and million  respectively  of incremental direct costs associated with customer contracts 
these deferred expenses would not have been incurred without our participation in a certain open market program and will be expensed in proportion to the related revenue being recognized 
during the years ended december   and  we expensed million  million and million  respectively  of deferred incremental direct costs to cost of revenues 
as of december   there had been no material realizability issues related to deferred incremental direct costs 
we also capitalize the costs of our production and generation equipment utilized in the delivery of our demand response services and expense this equipment over the lesser of its estimated useful life or the term of the contractual arrangement 
during the years ended december   and  we capitalized million  million and million  respectively  of production and generation equipment costs 
we believe that the above accounting treatments appropriately match expenses with the associated revenue 

table of contents gross profit and gross margin gross profit consists of our total revenues less our cost of revenues 
our gross profit has been  and will be  affected by many factors  including a the demand for our energy management applications  services and products  b the selling price of our energy management applications  services and products  c our cost of revenues  d the way in which we manage  or are permitted to manage by the relevant electric power grid operator or utility  our portfolio of demand response capacity  e the introduction of new energy management applications  services and products  f our demand response event performance and g our ability to open and enter new markets and regions and expand deeper into markets we already serve 
the effective management of our portfolio of demand response capacity  including our outcomes in negotiating favorable contracts with our customers and our participation in capacity auctions and bilateral contracts  and our demand response event performance  are the primary determinants of our gross profit and gross margin 
operating expenses operating expenses consist of selling and marketing  general and administrative  and research and development expenses 
personnel related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories 
we grew from full time employees at december  to full time employees at december  primarily as a result of our overall growth and expansion into new markets during this period 
we expect to continue to hire employees to support our growth for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we incur significant up front costs associated with the expansion of the number of mw under our management  which we expect to continue for the foreseeable future 
we expect our overall operating expenses to increase in absolute dollar terms for the foreseeable future as we continue to enable new c i customer sites  further increase our headcount and expand the development of our energy management applications  services and products 
in addition  amortization expense from intangible assets acquired in possible future acquisitions could potentially increase our operating expenses in future periods 
although we expect an increase in operating expenses in absolute dollar terms for the foreseeable future  we expect that operating expenses as a percentage of revenues will decrease as we continue to realize improvements in our operating leverage and overall cost management 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of a salaries and related personnel costs  including costs associated with share based payment awards  related to our sales and marketing organization  b commissions  c travel  lodging and other out of pocket expenses  d marketing programs such as trade shows and e other related overhead 
commissions are recorded as an expense when earned by the employee 
we expect an increase in selling and marketing expenses in absolute dollar terms for the foreseeable future as we further increase the number of sales professionals and  to a lesser extent  increase our marketing activities  however  we expect that selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues will decrease for the foreseeable future 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of a salaries and related personnel costs  including costs associated with share based payment awards and bonuses  related to our executive  finance  human resource  information technology and operations organizations  b facilities expenses  c accounting and legal professional fees  d depreciation and amortization and e other related overhead 
we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollar terms for the foreseeable future as we invest in infrastructure to support our continued growth  however  we expect that general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues will decrease for the foreseeable future 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of a salaries and related personnel costs  including costs associated with share based payment awards  related to our research and development organization  b payments to suppliers for design and consulting services  c costs relating to the design and development of 
table of contents new energy management applications  services and products and enhancement of existing energy management applications  services and products  d quality assurance and testing and e other related overhead 
during the years ended december   and  we capitalized software development costs of million  million and million  respectively  which are included as software in property and equipment at december  we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollar terms for the foreseeable future as we develop new technologies and enhance our existing technologies  however  we expect that research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues will decrease for the foreseeable future 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with accounting standards codification  or asc  stock compensation 
as such  all share based payments to employees  including grants of stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units  are recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values as of the date of grant 
during the year ended december   in lieu of a portion of cash bonuses related to our and bonus plans  we granted  shares of non vested restricted stock to certain executives and non executive employees that contain performance based vesting conditions 
these awards will vest in equal installments in and if the performance conditions are achieved 
if the employee who received the restricted stock leaves the company for any reason prior to the vesting date  the shares of restricted stock will be forfeited and returned to us 
in addition  in december  we granted  shares of non vested restricted stock to certain non executive employees that contained performance based vesting conditions in lieu of a portion of cash bonuses related to our and bonus plan 
the performance conditions associated with the december grants were modified during the three months ended march  as a result of these grants of non vested restricted stock  we anticipate that  on a per employee basis  stock based compensation expense will increase for the foreseeable future with a corresponding decrease in cash compensation expense 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded expenses of approximately million  million and million  respectively  in connection with share based payment awards to employees and non employees 
with respect to option grants through december   a future expense of non vested options of approximately million is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
for non vested restricted stock awards and restricted stock units subject to service based vesting conditions outstanding as of december   we had million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
for non vested restricted stock awards subject to performance based vesting conditions outstanding  and that were probable of vesting as of december   we had million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
for non vested restricted stock awards subject to outstanding performance based vesting conditions that were not probable of vesting as of december   we had million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense 
if and when any additional portion of our outstanding equity awards is deemed probable to vest or awards that are deemed probable to vest become not probable  we will reflect the effect of the change in estimate in the period of change by recording a cumulative catch up adjustment to retroactively apply the new estimate 
although the number of share based awards has increased significantly during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in due to stock based compensation being issued in lieu of certain cash compensation  the overall amount of our stock based compensation expense has decreased as a result of the lower fair value of these awards compared to awards granted in prior periods due to our lower stock price compared to the same period in accordingly  the weighted average grant date fair value of share based payments issued during the year ended december  was per share as compared to per share for the same period in interest and other expense income  net interest expense primarily consists of fees associated with the credit facility 
interest expense also consists of fees associated with issuing letters of credit and other financial assurances 
other income and expense consist primarily of gains or losses on transactions denominated in currencies other than our or our subsidiaries functional currency  interest income earned on cash balances  and other non operating income and expense 
we historically have invested our cash in money market funds  treasury funds  commercial paper  and municipal bonds 

table of contents consolidated results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues the following table summarizes our revenues for the years ended december  and in thousands december  dollar change percentage change revenues demandsmart efficiencysmart  supplysmart and other total revenues the overall decrease in our demandsmart revenues was primarily attributable to changes in the following existing operating areas dollars in thousands revenue decrease increase december  to december  pjm new england opa australia act texas california alberta other total decreased demandsmart revenues the amounts included in this category relate to net increases in various demand response programs  none of which are individually material 
the decrease in our demandsmart revenues for the year ended december   as compared to  was primarily attributable to less favorable pricing and a decrease in our mw delivery obligations in the pjm and iso ne programs  in addition to decreased energy revenues as a result of fewer demand response events that yielded energy payments and a change in the mix of energy rates 
in addition  the discontinuance of pjm s ilr program in june reduced our flexibility to manage our portfolio of demand response capacity in the pjm market and negatively impacted our revenues for the year ended december  the decrease in demandsmart revenues was also attributable to the termination of an iso ne program during the three months ended june   from which we derived revenues throughout compared to only six months during the year ended december  in addition  demandsmart revenues declined due to the recognition of million of previously deferred revenues during the year ended december  as a result of an amendment to our utility contract with opa  or the opa contract 
there was no similar recognition of deferred revenues under the opa contract during the year ended december  the decrease in demandsmart revenues was partially offset by an increase in enrolled mw and pricing in our western australia program and certain of our texas programs  including ercot  centerpoint and oncor and an increase in enrolled mw and improved performance in our california programs 
the decrease in demandsmart revenues was also partially offset by revenue we earned from the pennsylvania act  or act  programs and a demand response program in alberta  canada for which no revenues were recognized in 
table of contents for the year ended december   our efficiencysmart  supplysmart and other revenues increased  as compared to  due to continued growth in customers and contracts  the commencement of revenue recognition in that resulted from the completion of the installation phase of a million efficiencysmart data driven energy management application for the massachusetts department of energy resources  and enhanced customer relationships that resulted from our acquisitions of global energy and mm in in addition  the increase in our efficiencysmart  supplysmart and other revenues for the year ended december  was attributable to the recognition of a full year of revenues during fiscal from our acquisitions of global energy and mm  both of which occurred in early we currently expect our total demandsmart revenues to increase during the year ending december   or fiscal  as compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in pricing and enrolled mw in our western australia demand response program  as well as an increase in pjm revenues as pjm prices return to more historical levels 
gross profit and gross margin the following table summarizes our gross profit and gross margin percentages for our energy management applications  services and products for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  gross profit gross margin gross profit gross margin despite a decline in revenue  the slight increase in gross profit for the year ended december   as compared to  was primarily due to the gross profit generated from the increase in our enrolled mw and pricing in western australia and the gross profit generated from our new demandsmart arrangements in fiscal when no revenues were recognized in  including our act programs and our program in alberta  canada 
the increase in gross profit was also attributable to improved management of our portfolio of demand response capacity and an overall reduction in the percentage of revenues paid to our c i customers 
this increase in gross profit was partially offset by less favorable pricing and a decrease in enrolled mw in our pjm and iso ne programs  as well as the termination of an iso ne program during the three months ended june  from which we derived revenues throughout in addition  the increase in gross profit was also partially offset by the recognition of million of revenues during the year ended december  related to our opa contract for which we had recognized the associated cost of such revenues prior to there were no similar transactions during the year ended december  our gross margin during the year ended december  increased in comparison to due to improved management of our portfolio of demand response capacity  including the adjustment of our zonal capacity obligations through our participation in pjm incremental auctions and lower costs associated with our c i contracts 
these increases were offset by a decrease in gross margin under our opa contract due to the recognition of revenues during the year ended december  in connection with the amendment to the opa contract  for which we recognized the cost of such revenues in previous periods 
the increase in our gross margin during the year ended december  compared to was also offset by the decrease in gross margin that resulted from the recognition of revenues during the year ended december  in connection with our participation in a california demand response program for which we recognized the cost of such revenues in previous periods 
we currently expect that our gross margin for the year ending december  will be slightly higher than our gross margin for the year ended december  due to the continuing improvement in the management of our portfolio of demand response capacity  as well as lower costs associated with our c i contracts 
we also expect that our gross margin for the three months ending september  will be the highest gross margin among our four quarterly reporting periods in fiscal due to the seasonality of the demand response industry  which is consistent with our gross margin pattern in fiscal and prior years 

table of contents operating expenses the following table summarizes our operating expenses for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  percentage change operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative research and development total in certain forward capacity markets in which we participate  such as pjm  we may enable our c i customers  meaning we may install our equipment at a c i customer site to allow for the curtailment of mw from the electric power grid  up to twelve months in advance of enrolling the c i customer in a particular program 
as a result  there has been a trend of incurring operating expenses at the time of enablement  including salaries and related personnel costs  associated with enabling certain of our c i customers  in advance of recognizing the corresponding revenues 
selling and marketing expense the following table summarizes our selling and marketing expenses for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  percentage change payroll and related costs stock based compensation other total the increase in payroll and related costs for the year ended december  compared to was primarily due to an increase in the number of selling and marketing full time employees from at december  to at december  this increase was partially offset by lower commissions and a decrease in cash bonuses for fiscal as a portion of those bonuses will be settled in shares of our common stock and therefore is recorded in stock based compensation expense 
in addition  we incurred higher travel related costs of million primarily as a result of our continued international expansion 
the increase in stock based compensation for the year ended december  compared to was primarily due to a portion of the bonuses for fiscal that will be settled in shares of our common stock rather than cash and is  therefore  recorded as a component of stock based compensation expense 
this increase was offset by a lower grant date fair value of stock based awards granted during the year ended december   which was lower than the grant date fair value of stock based awards that became fully vested during the year ended december   as well as a reversal of stock based compensation expense that resulted from forfeitures of a greater number of stock based awards during the year ended december  the increase in other selling and marketing expenses for the year ended december  compared to was due to a million increase in amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets that resulted from our acquisition of energy response in july  a million increase in the allocation to selling and marketing of company wide overhead costs  which are allocated based upon headcount  due to higher facilities 
table of contents and it costs  and an increase in professional services fees of million 
this increase was partially offset by the recording in of approximately million of impairment charges associated with the discontinued use of the trade name intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of energy response and another immaterial acquisition that we completed in  in addition to the discontinuation of certain customer relationships related to our acquisition of eq 
we did not incur any such charges in we also incurred lower marketing costs of million in compared to general and administrative expenses the following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  percentage change payroll and related costs stock based compensation other total the increase in payroll and related costs for the year ended december  compared to was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of general and administrative full time employees from at december  to at december  this increase was partially offset by a portion of the bonuses for fiscal that will be settled in shares of our common stock rather than cash and is  therefore  recorded as a component of stock based compensation expense 
the decrease in stock based compensation for the year ended december  compared to was primarily due to the reversal of stock based compensation expense related to the forfeiture of stock based awards that were granted to our former chief financial officer  as well as fully vested stock awards that were granted to our board of directors at a lower grant date fair value in the year ended december  than the fair value of stock based awards granted to them during these decreases were offset by an increase in stock based compensation related to a portion of the bonuses for fiscal that will be settled in shares of our common stock rather than cash  which is recorded as a component of stock based compensation expense 
the increase in other general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  compared to was attributable to an increase of million in facilities expenses due to higher rent and insurance costs in addition to higher depreciation expense that resulted from a change in useful life of the leasehold improvements under our current lease  an increase of million in higher fees mainly associated with regulatory compliance  and an increase of million in information technology and communication costs in support of our business 
the increase in other general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  compared to was also attributable to a lease termination charge of million resulting from our election to terminate the operating lease for our current corporate headquarters effective june  these increases in other general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were offset by a decrease of million in finance charges  most of which were attributable to charges that we recorded during the year ended december  in connection with a certain contract that we terminated during the increase in other general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  was also offset by an increase of million in the allocation to selling and marketing  and research and development of company wide overhead costs 

table of contents research and development expenses the following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  percentage change payroll and related costs stock based compensation other total the increase in payroll and related costs for the year ended december  compared to was primarily driven by an increase in the number of research and development full time employees from at december  to at december   as well as an increase in salary rates per full time employee 
this increase was partially offset by an increase in capitalized application development costs primarily related to our demandsmart application  as well as a portion of the bonuses for fiscal that will be settled in shares of our common stock rather than cash and is  therefore  recorded as a component of stock based compensation expense 
the increase in stock based compensation for the year ended december  compared to was related to a portion of the bonuses for fiscal that will be settled in shares of our common stock rather than cash and is  therefore  recorded as a component of stock based compensation expense 
the increase in other research and development expenses for the year ended december  compared to was due to an increase of million in the allocation to research and development of company wide overhead costs which are allocated based upon headcount 
the increase in other research and development expenses was also due to an increase of million in software licensing fees 
this increase was partially offset by an impairment charge of million related to an indefinite lived in process research and development intangible asset and an impairment charge related to a definite lived patent intangible asset of less than million that were recorded in as a result of a review and realignment of our development efforts 
in addition  we incurred lower professional services fees during the year ended december  of million compared to and lower miscellaneous equipment expenses of million 
interest and other expense income  net the increase in interest expense of million for the year ended december  compared to was mainly attributable to the costs associated with the renegotiation of our credit facility  higher average outstanding letter of credit balances in addition to higher partner bank fees 
other income expense  net for the year ended december  was primarily comprised of foreign currency gains losses and a nominal amount of interest income 
we had approximately million at december  exchange rates million australian in intercompany receivables denominated in australian dollars that arose from the acquisition of energy response in july substantially all of the foreign currency gains losses represent unrealized gains losses and  therefore  are non cash in nature 
we currently do not hedge any of our foreign currency transactions 

table of contents income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
although our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards exceeded our taxable income for the years ended december  and  our annual effective tax rate was greater than zero due to the following estimated foreign taxes resulting from guaranteed profit allocable to our foreign subsidiaries  which have been determined to be limited risk service providers acting on behalf of the us parent for tax purposes  for which there are no tax net operating loss carryforwards  certain state taxes for jurisdictions where the states currently limit or disallow the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  and amortization of tax deductible goodwill  which generates a deferred tax liability that cannot be offset by net operating losses or other deferred tax assets since its reversal is considered indefinite in nature 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  we review all available evidence to evaluate the recovery of our deferred tax assets  including the recent history of accumulated losses in all tax jurisdictions over the last three years  as well as our ability to generate income in future periods

table of contents for the year ended december   our demand response revenues decreased by million  or  as compared to the year ended december  the decrease in our demandsmart revenues was primarily attributable to changes in the following existing operating areas dollars in thousands revenue increase decrease december  to december  pjm new england new york public service company of new mexico  or pnm opa california australia ercot xcel energy salt river project  or srp uk national grid tucson electric power  or tep other total decreased demand response revenues the decrease in our demandsmart revenues during the year ended december  compared to was primarily attributable to less favorable pricing in the pjm and new york markets  as well as a decrease in mw enrolled in our iso ne program and less favorable pricing compared to due to the commencement of a new iso ne program in june the decrease in demandsmart revenues was also partially attributable to fewer demand response events being called by pjm during the year ended december   which resulted in decreased energy payments  as compared to the decrease in demandsmart revenues was also partially attributable to a decrease in mw enrolled in our pnm program during the year ended december  as compared to the decrease in demandsmart revenues was partially offset by an increase in revenues recognized as a result of amendments to the opa contract during the year ended december  that resulted in the recognition of million of revenues during the year that had been previously deferred 
the decrease in demandsmart revenues was also partially offset by stronger demand response event performance in our california demand response programs  our ability to recognize revenues based on the finalization of performance in a certain california demand response program  and an increase in our enrolled mw in the xcel energy  srp  uk national grid  and certain other demand response programs in which we participate

the increase in gross profit was also partially attributable to stronger demand response event performance in certain of the demand response programs in which we participate  including iso ne  which in some cases resulted in increased energy payments for the year ended december  compared to  as well as our ability to recognize revenues based on the finalization of performance in a certain california demand response program for which the corresponding cost of revenues were recorded during the year ended december  the acquisitions that we completed in also contributed to the increase in gross profit for the year ended december  the increase in gross profit was partially offset by less favorable pricing in pjm and iso ne  as well as fewer demand response events being called by pjm during the year ended december   which resulted in decreased energy payments from pjm compared to the slight increase in gross margin during the year ended december   compared to was primarily due to the recognition of revenues in connection with the opa contract  pursuant to which we recognized the cost of revenues in prior periods due to the uncertainty of the realizability of these costs 
the increase was partially offset by less favorable pricing in pjm and iso ne  which was not entirely offset by lower payments to our c i customers 
operating expenses the following table summarizes our operating expenses for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  percentage change operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative research and development total in certain forward capacity markets in which we participate  such as pjm  we may enable our c i customers  meaning we may install our equipment at a c i customer site to allow for the curtailment of mw from the electric power grid  up to twelve months in advance of enrolling the c i customer in a particular demand response program

these decreases were offset by a full year of stock based compensation expense related to awards granted during the year ended december  and by stock based compensation expense related to awards granted during the year ended december  the increase in other selling and marketing expenses for the year ended december  compared to was primarily attributable to an increase in amortization expense of million due to the customer relationship and trade name intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisitions we completed in during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge of million related to the discontinued use of the trade name intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of energy response and another immaterial acquisition that we completed in  contributing to the increase in selling and marketing expenses for the year ended december  compared to in addition  during the year ended december   as a result of the discontinuation of certain customer relationships related to our acquisition of eq  we recorded an impairment charge of million during the three month period ended december  the increase in other selling and marketing expenses for the year ended december  compared to was also partially attributable to an increase in professional services fees of million

table of contents the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  compared to was partially due to an increase in the number of general and administrative full time employees from at december  to at december  the increase in headcount was partly offset by the timing of the hiring of those new full time employees during the decrease in stock based compensation for the year ended december  compared to was primarily due to prior period stock based awards that became fully vested in the first half of and the reversal of stock based compensation expense that resulted from forfeitures of a greater number of stock based awards in connection with an increase in our attrition rate 
the decrease in stock based compensation expense from was also partially attributable to fully vested stock awards granted to our board of directors during the year ended december  with a lower grant date fair value than the same amount of fully vested stock awards granted during the increase in other general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  compared to was primarily attributable to a million increase in finance costs due to charges that we recorded in connection with a certain contract that we terminated during the year ended december  as a result of this termination  we recorded charges of million during the year ended december   which represented the million paid upon the termination and million that had been previously capitalized 
in addition  the increase in other general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  compared to was also due to an increase in professional services fees of million incurred in connection with the integration of the acquisitions that we completed in  technology and communication costs of million due to increased software licensing fees and computer supplies  and an increase in facility costs of million due to the expansion of our office space as a result of our recent acquisitions

as a result  we recorded an impairment charge related to this indefinite lived in process research and development intangible asset of million and an impairment charge related to the associated definite lived patent intangible asset of less than million 
interest and other expense income  net interest expense for the year ended december  includes amortization of capitalized debt issuance costs  interest on our outstanding capital leases and letters of credit origination fees 
the increase in interest expense for the year ended december  compared to was due to the amortization of capitalized debt issuance costs associated with our previously outstanding million senior secured revolving credit facility  as amended  that we and one of our subsidiaries entered into with svb and a certain other financial institution in april  which we refer to as the credit facility  which were significantly higher than the amortization of debt issuance costs associated with our previously outstanding million secured revolving credit and term loan facility that we and one of our subsidiaries entered into with svb in august other expense  net for the year ended december  was primarily comprised of foreign currency losses related to certain intercompany receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
other expense  net for the year ended december  was primarily comprised of a nominal amount of foreign currency losses related to certain intercompany receivables denominated in foreign currencies offset by a nominal amount of interest income 
the significant increase in losses arising from transactions denominated in foreign currencies for the year ended december  compared to was due to the significant increase in foreign denominated intercompany receivables held by us from one of our australian subsidiaries  primarily as a result of the funding provided to complete the acquisition of energy response  and the strengthening of the united states dollar as compared to the australian dollar during the year ended december  as of december   we had an intercompany receivable from our australian subsidiary that is denominated in australian dollars and not deemed to be of a long term investment nature totaling million at december  exchange rates million australian 
the significant increase in losses arising from transactions denominated in foreign currencies was primarily unrealized losses and therefore a non cash expense 
we did not engage in any currency hedging transactions during the year ended december  income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
although our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards exceeded our taxable income for the years ended december  and  our annual effective tax rate was greater than zero due to the following estimated foreign taxes resulting from guaranteed profit allocable to our foreign subsidiaries  which have been determined to be limited risk service providers acting on behalf of the us parent for tax purposes  for which there are no tax net operating loss carryforwards  certain state taxes for jurisdictions where the states currently limit or disallow the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  and amortization of tax deductible goodwill  which generates a deferred tax liability that cannot be offset by net operating losses or other deferred tax assets since its reversal is considered indefinite in nature 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  we review all available evidence to evaluate the recovery of our deferred tax assets  including the recent history of accumulated losses in all tax jurisdictions over the last three years  as well as our ability to generate income in future periods

additional information non gaap financial measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis  we disclose certain non gaap measures that exclude certain amounts  including non gaap net loss income  non gaap net loss income per share  adjusted ebitda and free cash flow 
these non gaap measures are not in accordance with  or an alternative for  generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the gaap measure most comparable to non gaap net loss income is gaap net loss income  the gaap measure most comparable to non gaap net loss income per share is gaap net loss income per share  the gaap measure most comparable to adjusted ebitda is gaap net loss income  and the gaap measure most comparable to free cash flow is net cash provided by used in operating activities 
reconciliations of each of these non gaap financial measures to the corresponding gaap measure are included below 
use and economic substance of non gaap financial measures management uses these non gaap measures when evaluating our operating performance and for internal planning and forecasting purposes 
management believes that such measures help indicate underlying trends in our business  are important in comparing current results with prior period results  and are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing our operating performance 
for example  management considers non gaap net loss income to be an important indicator of the overall performance because it eliminates the effects of events that are either not part of our core operations or are non cash compensation expenses 
in addition  management considers adjusted ebitda to be an important indicator of our operational strength and performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trend 
moreover  management considers free cash flow to be an indicator of our operating trend and performance of our business 
the following is an explanation of the non gaap measures that we utilize  including the adjustments that management excluded as part of the non gaap measures for the years ended december   and  respectively  as well as reasons for excluding these individual items management defines non gaap net loss income as net income loss before expenses related to stock based compensation and amortization expenses related to acquisition related intangible assets  net of related tax effects 
management defines adjusted ebitda as net loss income  excluding depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation  interest  income taxes and other income expense 
adjusted ebitda eliminates items that are either not part of our core operations or do not require a cash outlay  such as stock based compensation 
adjusted ebitda also excludes depreciation and amortization expense  which is based on our estimate of the useful life of tangible and intangible assets 
these estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset  are based on historic cost incurred to build out our deployed network and may not be indicative of current or future capital expenditures 
management defines free cash flow as net cash provided by used in operating activities less capital expenditures 
management defines capital expenditures as purchases of property and equipment  which includes capitalization of internal use software development costs

the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuations and purchase price allocations related to business combinations  expected future cash flows including growth rates  discount rates  terminal values and other assumptions and estimates used to evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets and goodwill  estimated fair values of intangible assets and goodwill  amortization methods and periods  certain accrued expenses and other related charges  stock based compensation  contingent liabilities  tax reserves and recoverability of our deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
any differences could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of appendix a to this annual report on form k  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with asc  revenue recognition  or asc in all of our arrangements  we do not recognize any revenues until persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and we deem collection to be reasonably assured 
in making these judgments  we evaluate these criteria as follows evidence of an arrangement 
we consider a definitive agreement signed by the customer and us or an arrangement enforceable under the rules of an open market bidding program to be representative of persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
delivery has occurred 
we consider delivery to have occurred when service has been delivered to the customer and no post delivery obligations exist 
in instances where customer acceptance is required  delivery is deemed to have occurred when customer acceptance has been achieved 
fees are fixed or determinable 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable unless the fee is subject to refund or adjustment or is not payable within normal payment terms 
if the fee is subject to refund or adjustment and we cannot reliably estimate this amount  we recognize revenues when the right to a refund or adjustment lapses 
if offered payment terms significantly exceed our normal terms  we recognize revenues as the amounts become due and payable or upon the receipt of cash 
collection is reasonably assured 
we conduct a credit review at the inception of an arrangement to determine the creditworthiness of the customer 
collection is reasonably assured if  based upon our evaluation  we expect that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  revenues are deferred and recognized upon the receipt of cash 
we enter into contracts and open market bidding programs with utilities and electric power grid operators to provide demand response applications and services 
demand response revenues consist of two elements revenue earned based on our ability to deliver committed capacity to our electric power grid operator and utility customers  which we refer to as capacity revenue  and revenue earned based on additional payments made to us for the amount of energy usage actually curtailed from the grid during a demand response event  which we refer to as energy event revenue 
we recognize demand response revenue when we have provided verification to the electric power grid operator or utility of our ability to deliver the committed capacity which entitles us to payments under the utility contract or open market program 
committed capacity is generally verified through the results of an actual demand response event or a measurement and verification test 
once the capacity amount has been verified  the revenue is recognized and future revenue becomes fixed or determinable and is recognized monthly until the next demand response event or test 
in subsequent verification events  if our verified capacity is below the previously verified amount  the electric power grid operator or utility customer will reduce future payments based on the adjusted verified capacity amounts 
ongoing demand response revenue recognized between demand response events or tests that are not subject to penalty or customer refund are recognized in revenue 
if the revenue is subject to refund and the amount of refund cannot be reliably estimated  the revenue is deferred until the right of refund lapses 
we have evaluated the factors within asc regarding gross versus net revenue reporting for our demand response revenues and payments to c i customers 
based on the evaluation of the factors within asc  we determined that all of the applicable indicators of gross revenue reporting were met 
these applicable indicators of gross revenue reporting included  but were not limited to  the following we are the primary obligor in our arrangements with electric power grid operators and utility customers because we provide demand response services directly to electric power grid operators and utilities under long term contracts or pursuant to open market programs and contract separately with c i customers to deliver such services 
we manage all interactions with the electric power grid operators and utilities  while c i customers do not interact with the electric power grid operators and utilities 
in addition  we assume the entire performance risk under arrangements with electric power grid operators and utility customers  
table of contents including the posting of financial assurance to assure timely delivery of committed capacity with no corresponding financial assurance received from c i customers 
in the event of a shortfall in delivered committed capacity  we are responsible for all penalties assessed by the electric power grid operators and utilities without regard for any recourse we may have with our c i customers 
we have latitude in establishing pricing  as the pricing under our arrangements with electric power grid operators and utilities is negotiated through a contract proposal and contracting process or determined through a capacity auction 
we then separately negotiate payment to c i customers and have complete discretion in the contracting process with the c i customer 
we have complete discretion in determining the supplier c i customer to provide the demand response services  provided that the c i customer is located in the same region as the applicable electric power grid operator or utility 
we are involved in both the determination of service specifications and performing part of the services  including the installation of metering and other equipment for the monitoring  data gathering and measurement of performance  as well as  in certain circumstances  the remote control of c i customer loads 
as a result  we determined that we earn revenue as a principal from the delivery of demand response services to electric power grid operators and utility customers and we record the amounts billed to the electric power grid operators and utility customers as gross demand response revenues and the amounts paid to c i customers as cost of revenues 
in the pjm open market program in which we participate  the program year operates on a june to may basis and performance is measured based on the aggregate performance during the months of june through september 
as a result  fees received for the month of june could potentially be subject to adjustment or refund based on performance during the months of july through september 
based on recent changes to certain pjm program rules  we have concluded that we no longer have the ability to reliably estimate the amount of fees potentially subject to adjustment or refund until the performance period ends on september th of each year 
therefore  commencing in fiscal  all demand response capacity revenues related to our participation in the pjm open market program are being recognized at the end of the performance period  or september th of each year 
because the period during which we are required to perform june through september is shorter than the period over which we receive payments under the program june through may  a portion of the revenues that have been earned are recorded and accrued as unbilled revenue 
as a result of the billing period not coinciding with the revenue recognition period  we had million in unbilled revenues from pjm at december  certain of the forward capacity programs in which we participate may be deemed derivative contracts under asc  derivatives and hedging  or asc in such situations  we believe we meet the scope exception under asc as a normal purchase  normal sale as that term is defined in asc and  accordingly  the arrangement is not treated as a derivative contract 
energy event revenues are recognized when earned 
energy event revenue is deemed to be substantive and represents the culmination of a separate earnings process and is recognized when the energy event is initiated by the electric power grid operator or utility customer and we have responded under the terms of the contract or open market program 
with respect to our non demand response revenues  which represent our efficiencysmart  supplysmart and other revenues  these generally represent ongoing service arrangements where the revenues are recognized ratably over the service period commencing upon delivery of the contracted service with the customer 
under certain of our arrangements  in particular certain efficiencysmart arrangements with utilities  a portion of the fees received may be subject to adjustment or refund based on the validation of the energy savings delivered after the implementation is complete 
as a result  we defer the portion of the fees that are subject to adjustment or refund until such time as the right of adjustment or refund lapses  which is generally upon completion and validation of the implementation 
in addition  under certain of our other arrangements  we sell proprietary equipment to c i customers that is utilized to provide the ongoing services that the we deliver 

table of contents currently  this equipment has been determined to not have stand alone value 
as a result  we defer revenues associated with the equipment and we begin recognizing such revenue ratably over the expected c i customer relationship period generally years  once the c i customer is receiving the ongoing services from us 
in addition  we capitalize the associated direct and incremental costs  which primarily represent the equipment and third party installation costs  and recognizes such costs over the expected c i customer relationship period 
we adopted asc update no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu  at the beginning of its first quarter of the fiscal year ended december   fiscal  on a prospective basis for transactions originating or materially modified on or after january  the impact of adopting asu was not material to our financial statements for fiscal  and if it was applied in the same manner to the fiscal year ended december   or fiscal  would not have had a material impact to revenue for fiscal the adoption of asu has not had and is not expected to have a significant impact on the timing and pattern of revenue recognition due to our limited number of multiple element arrangements 
we typically determine the selling price of our services based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe 
consistent with its methodology under previous accounting guidance  we determine vsoe based on its normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific service when sold on a stand alone basis 
in determining vsoe  our policy is to require a substantial majority of selling prices for a product or service to be within a reasonably narrow range 
we also consider the class of customer  method of distribution  and the geographies into which its products and services are sold when determining vsoe 
we typically have had vsoe for its products and services 
in certain circumstances  we are not able to establish vsoe for all deliverables in a multiple element arrangement 
this may be due to the infrequent occurrence of stand alone sales for an element  a limited sales history for new services or pricing within a broader range than permissible by our policy to establish vsoe 
in those circumstances  we proceed to the alternative levels in the hierarchy of determining selling price 
third party evidence  or tpe  of selling price is established by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in stand alone sales to similarly situated customers 
we are typically not able to determine tpe and has not used this measure since we have been unable to reliably verify standalone prices of competitive solutions 
management s best estimate of selling price  or esp  is established in those instances where neither vsoe nor tpe are available  considering internal factors such as margin objectives  pricing practices and controls  customer segment pricing strategies and the product life cycle 
consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing information gathered from experience in customer negotiations  market research and information  recent technological trends  competitive landscape and geographies 
use of esp is limited to a very small portion of our services  principally certain efficiencysmart services 
we maintain a reserve for customer adjustments and allowances as a reduction in revenues 
in determining our revenue reserve estimate  and in accordance with internal policy  we rely on historical data and known performance adjustments 
these factors  and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment  could cause our reserve estimates to differ from actual results 
we record a provision for estimated customer adjustments and allowances in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on the specific facts and circumstances of a particular program  analysis of credit memoranda data  historical customer adjustments  and other known factors 
if the data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect reserve requirements  then a change in the allowances would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be affected 
during the year ended december   we recorded a revenue reserve of million based on our analysis 
reserve requirements in and were not material 
business combinations we record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations under the purchase method of accounting 
amounts paid for each acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition 
the fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management 
we estimate the fair value of contingent consideration at the time of the acquisition using all pertinent information 
table of contents known to us at the time to assess the probability of payment of contingent amounts 
we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill 
we use the income approach to determine the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets  including customer contracts  customer relationships  non compete agreements and trade names 
this approach determines fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to an in process project over its useful life and then discounting these after tax cash flows back to a present value 
we base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes  expected market growth rates and expected trends  including introductions by competitors of new services and products 
we base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value of money and market participant investment risk factors 
the use of different assumptions could materially impact the purchase price allocation and our financial condition and results of operations 
customer relationships represent established relationships with customers  which provide a ready channel for the sale of additional energy management applications  services and products 
non compete agreements represent arrangements with certain employees that limit or prevent their ability to take employment at a competitor for a fixed period of time 
trade names represent acquired product names that we intend to continue to utilize 
we have also utilized the cost approach to determine the estimated fair value of acquired indefinite lived intangible assets related to acquired in process research and development given the stage of development as of the acquisition date and the lack of sufficient information regarding future expected cash flows 
the cost approach calculates fair value by calculating the reproduction cost of an exact replica of the subject intangible asset 
we calculate the replacement cost based on actual development costs incurred through the date of acquisition 
in determining the appropriate valuation methodology  we consider  among other factors the in process projects stage of completion  the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date  the costs already incurred  the projected costs to complete  the expected introduction date  and the estimated useful life of the technology 
we believe that the estimated in process research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects 
impairment of intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets we amortize our intangible assets that have finite lives using either the straight line method or  if reliably determinable  based on the pattern in which the economic benefit of the asset is expected to be consumed utilizing expected undiscounted future cash flows 
amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives ranging from one to ten years 
we review our intangible assets subject to amortization to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life 
if the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows  we will write down the carrying value of the intangible asset to its fair value in the period identified 
in assessing recoverability  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and discount rates 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
we generally calculate fair value as the present value of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset using a risk adjusted discount rate 
if the estimate of an intangible asset s remaining useful life is changed  we will amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life 
during the year ended december   we did not identify any adverse conditions or change in expected cash flows or useful lives of our definite lived intangible assets that could indicate the existence of a potential impairment 
during the year ended december   as a result of a discontinuation of certain trade names acquired in connection with the acquisition of energy response in july and another immaterial acquisition that 
table of contents occurred in january  we determined that these definite lived intangible assets were impaired and recorded an impairment charge of million to reduce the carrying value of these assets to zero  which was included in selling and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  during the year ended december   as a result of the discontinuation of certain customer relationships related to a acquisition  we recorded an impairment charge of million which was included in selling and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
during the year ended december   as a result of our review and realignment of our development efforts  we discontinued our efforts to complete the development of a certain in process research and development indefinite lived intangible asset related to our march acquisition of zox 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge related to this indefinite lived in process research and development intangible asset of million and an impairment charge related to the associated definite lived patent intangible asset of less than million  both of which are included in research and development expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  we had no indefinite lived intangible assets as of december  or  respectively 
goodwill in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other  or asc  we test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
we have determined that we currently have two reporting units our consolidated australian operations and all other operations 
although our chief operating decision maker  which is our chief executive officer and certain members of our executive management team  collectively  make business decisions based on the evaluation of financial information at the entity level  certain discrete financial information is available related to our consolidated australian operations with such discrete financial information utilized by the business unit manager to manage the consolidated australian operations and make decisions for those operations 
the consolidated australian operations are comprised of the operations acquired in the acquisitions of energy response and another immaterial acquisition  as well as the operations of our subsidiary  enernoc australia pty ltd 
events that would indicate impairment and trigger an interim impairment assessment include  but are not limited to  current economic and market conditions  including a decline in market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors  business climate or operational performance of the business  and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
our annual impairment test date is november  which we refer to as the impairment date 
in performing the test  we utilize the two step approach prescribed under asc the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units to the fair value of these units 
we consider a number of factors to determine the fair value of a reporting unit  including an independent valuation to conduct this test 
the valuation is based upon expected future discounted operating cash flows of the reporting unit as well as analysis of recent sales or offerings of similar companies 
we base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date of the impairment test on our weighted average cost of capital  or wacc 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we will perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value 
in order to determine the fair value of our reporting units  we utilize both a market approach based on the quoted market price of our common stock and the number of shares outstanding and a discounted cash flow  or dcf  under the income approach 
the key assumptions that drive the fair value in the dcf model are the discount rates ie wacc  terminal values  growth rates  and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows 
if the current worldwide financial markets and economic environment were to deteriorate  this would likely result in a higher wacc because market participants would require a higher rate of return 
in the dcf  as the wacc increases  the fair value decreases 
the other significant factor in the dcf is its projected financial information ie  amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates and if its assumptions were to be adversely impacted  this could result in a reduction of the fair value of the entity 
as a result of completing the first step on the impairment date  the fair value exceeded the carrying value  and as such the second step of 
table of contents the impairment test was not required 
to date  we have not been required to perform the second step of the impairment test 
as of the impairment date and as of december   our market capitalization exceeded the fair value of our consolidated net assets by more than 
in addition  as of the impairment date  the fair value of both our consolidated australian reporting unit and our all other operations reporting unit exceeded each of their respective carrying values by more than 
the estimate of fair value requires significant judgment 
any loss resulting from an impairment test would be reflected in operating loss in our consolidated statements of operations 
the annual impairment testing process is subjective and requires judgment at many points throughout the analysis 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets  including property and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable over their remaining estimated useful lives 
if these assets are considered to be impaired the long lived assets are measured for impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets or liabilities 
impairment is recognized in earnings and equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value determined by either a quoted market price  if any  or a value determined by utilizing a dcf technique 
if these assets are not impaired  but their useful lives have decreased  the remaining net book value is amortized over the revised useful life 
during the years ended december   and  we identified impairment indicators related to certain demand response equipment as a result of the removal of such equipment from service during each of these respective years 
as a result of these impairment indicators  we performed impairment tests during the years ended december   and  and recognized impairment charges of million  million and million  respectively  representing the difference between the carrying value and fair market value of the demand response equipment  which is included in cost of revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the fair market value was determined utilizing level inputs  as defined by asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  or asc  based on the projected future cash flows discounted using the estimated market participant rate of return for this type of asset 
in connection with the decision that we made in the fourth quarter of to net settle a portion of our future contractual delivery obligations in a certain open market bidding program  we concluded that it was more likely than not that certain of our production and generation equipment utilized in connection with this demand response arrangement would be disposed or abandoned  significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life  and that this represented a potential indicator of impairment 
accordingly  we performed an impairment test during the year ended december  the applicable long lived assets are measured for impairment at the lowest level at which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets or liabilities 
we determined that the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset group over its remaining estimated useful life would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset group 
we then determined the fair value of the asset group using a discounted cash flow technique based on level inputs  as defined by asc  and a discount rate of  which we determined represents a market rate of return for the assets being evaluated for impairment 
our estimate of the fair value of the asset group was million compared to the carrying value of the asset group of million 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million during the year ended december   which is reflected in cost of revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the impairment charge was allocated to the individual assets within the asset group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets 

table of contents we also re evaluated the estimated useful life of this production and generation equipment and concluded that a change in the estimated useful life was required 
as a result  in december  we revised the estimated useful life of the remaining net book value of the production and generation equipment totaling million to fully depreciate these assets over the shorter of their estimated remaining useful life or the date on which our delivery obligations under this demand response arrangement are expected to cease 
during the years ended december  and  we identified potential indicators of impairment related to certain demand response and back up generator equipment as a result of lower than estimated demand response event performance by these assets 
as a result of the potential indicators of impairment  we performed impairment tests 
the applicable long lived assets are measured for impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets or liabilities 
we determined that the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset group over its remaining estimated useful life would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset group 
we determined the fair value of the asset group using a discounted cash flow technique based on level inputs  as defined by asc  and a discount rate of  which we determined represents a market rate of return for the assets being evaluated for impairment 
we recorded impairment charges of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  which is reflected in cost of revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the impairment charges were allocated to the individual assets within the asset group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets 
software development costs we capitalize eligible costs associated with software developed or obtained for internal use 
we capitalize the payroll and payroll related costs of employees who devote time to the development of internal use computer software in addition to applicable third party costs 
we amortize these costs on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the software  which is generally two to three years 
our judgment is required in determining the point at which various projects enter the stages at which costs may be capitalized  in assessing the ongoing value and impairment of the capitalized costs  and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized 
internal use software development costs of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  have been capitalized 
included in the capitalized software development costs for the year ended december  is million of software development costs related to the implementation of a company wide human resource system which was put into production in june and is being amortized over a three year useful life 
during the year ended december   we capitalized million of software development costs related to a company wide enterprise resource planning system implementation project which was put into production in june and is being amortized over a five year useful life 
the costs for the development of new software and substantial enhancements to existing software that is intended to be sold or marketed  or external use software  are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  at which time any additional costs would be capitalized 
we determine that technological feasibility of external use software is established at the time a working model of software is completed 
because we believe our current process for developing external use software will be essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility  no costs have been capitalized to date 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense associated with the fair value of stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units issued to our employees 
determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options 
we use a lattice model to determine the fair value of our stock options 
we consider a number of factors to determine the fair value of stock options 
the model requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions expected volatility we are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors  including third party estimates  when estimating volatility 
we currently use a combination of historical and implied volatility  which is weighted based on a number of factors 

table of contents exit rate post vesting we use historical option forfeiture and expiration data to estimate the post vesting exit rate 
we believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected future post vesting forfeiture rate 
risk free interest rate the yield on zero coupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the risk free interest rate 
the fair value of stock awards where vesting is solely based on service vesting conditions is expensed ratably over the vesting period 
with respect to certain awards of restricted stock where vesting contains certain performance based vesting conditions  the fair value is expensed based on the accelerated attribution method as prescribed by asc over the vesting period 
during the year ended december   we granted  shares of non vested restricted stock to certain executives and non executive employees that contain performance based vesting conditions and these awards will vest in equal installments in and if the performance conditions are achieved 
if the employee who received the restricted stock leaves our employment prior to the vesting date for any reason  the shares of restricted stock will be forfeited and returned to us 
in november  our board of directors approved a plan to include performance based stock awards as part of the annual non executive bonus plan 
in december   shares were issued under our amended and restated employee  director and consultant stock plan with a fair value of million and these awards will vest in equal installments in and if the performance conditions are achieved 
through december   we determined that no awards were probable of vesting and as a result  no stock based compensation expense related to these awards was recorded through december  in march  the performance conditions were modified and we determined that the modified performance conditions were probable of being achieved 
as the performance based stock awards were improbable of vesting prior to the modification of the performance conditions  the original grant date fair value is no longer used to measure compensation cost for the awards 
the fair value of these awards was re measured as of the modification date resulting in a new grant date fair value of million after accounting for cancelled grants due to employee terminations 
as these awards were probable of vesting as of march  and a portion of the service period had lapsed  we recorded a cumulative catch up adjustment of stock based compensation expense during as required by asc during the year ended december   there were no other changes to probabilities of existing performance based stock awards which had a material impact on stock based compensation expense or amounts expected to be recognized 
the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
asc requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
based on an analysis of historical forfeitures  we have determined a specific forfeiture rate for certain employee groups and have applied forfeiture rates ranging from to as of december  depending on the specific employee group 
this analysis is re evaluated periodically and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary 
ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest 
we recognized million  million and million of stock based compensation expense for employee equity awards during the years ended december   and  respectively 
of the stock options outstanding at december    options were held by our employees and directors and  options were held by non employees 
for outstanding unvested stock options related to employees as of december   we had million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
there were no material unvested non employee stock options as of december  for non vested restricted stock and restricted stock units subject to service based vesting conditions outstanding as of december   we had million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average years 
for non vested restricted stock subject to performance based vesting conditions outstanding and that were probable of vesting as of december   we had million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense  which is expected to be recognized over 
table of contents a weighted average period of years 
for non vested restricted stock subject to performance based vesting conditions outstanding that were not probable of vesting as of december   we had million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense 
if and when any additional portion of these equity awards are deemed probable to vest or awards that are deemed probable to vest become not probable  we will reflect the effect of the change in estimate in the period of change by recording a cumulative catch up adjustment to retroactively apply the new estimate 
accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between financial reporting and taxes bases of our assets and liabilities 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse 
we have incurred consolidated net losses since our inception and as a result  we had not recognized net united states deferred taxes as of december  or december  our deferred tax liabilities primarily relate to deferred taxes associated with our acquisitions and property and equipment 
our deferred tax assets relate primarily to net operating loss carryforwards  accruals and reserves  deferred revenue and stock based compensation 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
in accordance with asc  income taxes  or asc  we are required to evaluate uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements 
asc prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
asc also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition and defines the criteria that must be met for the benefits of a tax position to be recognized 
we had million and unrecognized tax benefits as of december  and  respectively 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
in our opinion  it is not required that we have a provision for income taxes for any years subject to audit 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
in the event our assumptions are incorrect  the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 
recent accounting pronouncements presentation of comprehensive income in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income  or asu  which requires an entity to present total comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
asu does not change any of the components of comprehensive income  but it eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of stockholders equity 
asu was effective in the first quarter of and should be applied retrospectively 
as such  we adopted asu in and have provided a separate statement of comprehensive income loss in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued asu  deferring certain provisions of asu one of the provisions of asu required entities to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income loss by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income loss is presented for both interim and annual financial statements 
this requirement is indefinitely deferred by asu and will be further deliberated by the fasb at a future date 
the effective date of asu is the same as that for the unaffected provisions of asu disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 balance sheet topic disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities  or asu asu requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
an entity is required to apply asu for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods 
an entity should provide the disclosures required by asu retrospectively for all comparative periods presented 
we do not expect that the adoption of asu will have a significant  if any  impact on our consolidated financial statements

table of contents foreign currency exchange risk our international business is subject to risks  including  but not limited to unique economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
a majority of our foreign expense and sales activities are transacted in local currencies  including australian dollars  british pounds  canadian dollars and new zealand dollars 
fluctuations in the foreign currency rates could affect our sales  cost of revenues and profit margins and could result in exchange losses 
in addition  currency devaluations can result in a loss if we maintain deposits in a foreign currency 
during each of the years ended december   and  our sales generated outside the united states were  and  respectively 
we anticipate that sales generated outside the united states will continue to represent greater than of our consolidated sales and will continue to grow in subsequent fiscal years 
the operating expenses of our international subsidiaries that are incurred in local currencies did not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition for fiscal our operating results and certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are affected by changes in the relative strength of the us dollar against the applicable foreign currency 
our expenses denominated in foreign currencies are positively affected when the us dollar strengthens against the applicable foreign currency and adversely affected when the us dollar weakens 
during the years ended december   and  we incurred foreign exchange gains losses of million  million and million  respectively 
the significant increase in gains losses arising from transactions denominated in foreign currencies for the years ended december  and  as compared to the same period in  was due to the significant increase of foreign denominated intercompany receivables held by us from one of our australian subsidiaries primarily as a result of the funding provided to complete the acquisition of energy response in july and the fluctuations of the us dollar as compared to the australian dollar from the date of acquisition through december  during the year ended december   we realized gains of million related to transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
during the years ended december  and  there were no material realized gains losses incurred related to transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
as of december   we had an intercompany receivable from our australian subsidiary that is denominated in australian dollars and not deemed to be of a long term investment nature totaling million at december  exchange rates million australian 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in foreign currencies in which we transact would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations other than the impact on the unrealized gain loss on the intercompany receivable held by us from our australian subsidiary that is denominated in australian dollars  and for which a hypothetical increase or decrease in the foreign currency would result in an incremental million gain or loss 
we currently do not have a program in place that is designed to mitigate our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we are evaluating certain potential programs  including the use of derivative financial instruments  to reduce our exposure to foreign exchange gains and losses  and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates 
the utilization of forward foreign currency contracts would reduce  but would not eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements 
interest rate risk as of december   we had no outstanding debt under the credit facility 
the recent market events have not required us to materially modify or change our financial risk management strategies with respect to our exposure to interest rate risk 
we manage our cash and cash equivalents portfolio considering investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
our investment portfolio consists primarily of cash and cash 
table of contents equivalents 
we have  in the past  held municipal auction rate securities that have since been redeemed 
as our investments are made with highly rated securities  we are not anticipating any significant impact in the short term from a change in interest rates
