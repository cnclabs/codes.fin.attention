in thousands current assets   current liabilities   working capital   
table of contents our working capital decreased by as of september  from our working capital as of september  primarily due to our using cash as part of the purchase price for our acquisition during the first quarter of our fiscal year of the two parcels of real property  one of which is contiguous to the real property we own where our combination package liquor store and restaurant located at biscayne boulevard  north miami  florida  store operates and the other of which is contiguous thereto for a purchase price of   of which was financed by the seller pursuant to the m mortgage loan and  of which was expended by us as the cash required to close 
the decrease in our working capital was also caused by our using cash to pay for renovations at the new restaurant which opened in december  while there can be no assurance due to  among other things  unanticipated expenses or unanticipated decline in revenues  or both  we believe that our cash on hand and positive cash flow from operations will adequately fund operations  debt reductions and planned capital expenditures throughout our fiscal year off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of the end of our fiscal year or our fiscal year critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements located in item of this annual report on form k 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies are subject to estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements estimated useful lives of property and equipment the estimates of useful lives for property and equipment are significant estimates 
expenditures for the leasehold improvements and equipment when a restaurant is first constructed are material 
in addition  periodic refurbishing takes place and those expenditures can be material 
we estimate the useful life of those assets by considering  among other things  expected use  life of the lease on the building  and warranty period  if applicable 
the assets are then depreciated using a straight line method over those estimated lives 
these estimated lives are reviewed periodically and adjusted if necessary 
any necessary adjustment to depreciation expense is made in the income statement of the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary 

table of contents consolidation of limited partnerships as of september   we operate nine restaurants as general partner of the limited partnerships that own the operations of these restaurants 
we expect that any expansion which takes place in opening new restaurants will also result in us operating the restaurants as general partner 
in addition to the general partnership interest we also purchase limited partnership units ranging from to of the total units outstanding 
as a result of these controlling interests  we consolidate the operations of these limited partnerships with ours despite the fact that we do not own in excess of of the equity interests 
all intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation 
the non controlling interests in the earnings of these limited partnerships are removed from net income and are not included in the calculation of earnings per share 
income taxes fasb asc topic income taxes  requires  among other things  recognition of future tax benefits measured at enacted rates attributable to deductible temporary differences between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and to tax net operating loss and tip credit carryforwards to the extent that realization of said benefits is more likely than not 
for discussion regarding our carryforwards refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year other matters impact of inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food  beverage and labor costs 
a large number of restaurant personnel are paid at rates based upon applicable minimum wage and increases in minimum wage directly affect labor costs 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on our operating results  but this circumstance may change in the future if food and fuel costs continue to rise
