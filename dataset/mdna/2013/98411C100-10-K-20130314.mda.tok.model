item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing a portfolio of internally discovered product candidates with an initial focus on neurological disorders 
our innovative product and product candidates are prodrugs that are typically created by modifying the chemical structure of currently marketed drugs  referred to as parent drugs  and are designed to correct limitations in the oral absorption  distribution and or metabolism of the parent drug 
our marketed product and each of our product candidates are orally available  patented or patentable molecules that address potential markets with clear unmet medical needs 
our marketed product is approved in the united states  where it is known as horizant gabapentin enacarbil extended release tablets  and in japan  where it is known as regnite gabapentin enacarbil extended release tablets 
horizant is approved by the us food and drug administration  or fda  for the treatment of moderate to severe primary restless legs syndrome  or rls  and for the management of postherpetic neuralgia  or phn  in adults regnite is approved by the japanese ministry of health  labor and welfare  or mhlw  as a treatment for patients with rls 
in addition to our marketed product  we have three product candidates in clinical development 
our lead product candidate  arbaclofen placarbil  or ap  is a potential treatment for patients with spasticity 
we are conducting a pivotal phase clinical trial for ap as a potential treatment for spasticity in patients with multiple sclerosis  or ms  and we anticipate top line results will be available early in the second quarter of our second product candidate  xp  is a potential treatment for patients with advanced idiopathic parkinson s disease  and we plan to continue development of xp to the extent our resources permit or we enter into a collaboration with a third party 
we are evaluating our third product candidate  xp  in phase studies with healthy subjects to determine its safety and pharmacokinetic profile 
we believe that xp could be a potential treatment for patients with relapsing remitting ms  or rrms  psoriasis and or certain other disorders where the mechanism of action of xp may be relevant 
on november   we executed a termination and transition agreement with glaxo group limited  or gsk  that terminated our development and commercialization agreement with respect to horizant  and also provided for a mutual release of claims and resolved all ongoing litigation between the parties 
pursuant to the termination and transition agreement  during a transition period that will end on april   gsk will continue to exclusively commercialize  promote  manufacture and distribute horizant in the united states 
we will not be responsible for any losses associated with the terminated collaboration agreement  are no longer eligible to receive any further milestone payments from gsk and will not receive any revenue or incur any losses from gsk s sales of horizant during the transition period 
in addition  prior to the end of the transition period  gsk will provide to us inventory of gabapentin enacarbil in gsk s possession that is not required for use by gsk in the manufacture of horizant 
in exchange for such inventory  we will make annual payments to gsk of million for six years beginning in following the transition period  we will assume all responsibilities for further development  manufacturing and commercialization of horizant in the united states 
we have elected to have gsk continue to supply horizant tablets to us for up to six months following the transition period 
pursuant to a separate stock purchase agreement  or spa  entered into between us and gsk on november   gsk purchased million of our common stock  or an aggregate of  shares at per share  which per share price represented a percent premium to the average of the closing prices of our common stock for the ten trading days prior to october  in addition  on november   we exercised a put option requiring gsk to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock at per share  which per share price represented a percent premium to the average of the closing prices of our common stock for the ten trading days prior to november  revenues recognized through december  have been primarily comprised of up front  milestone and contingent event based payments from our collaboration agreements 
however  as a result of our termination and transition agreement with gsk and the return of the commercialization rights to horizant to us  we expect the future composition of our revenues to consist primarily of revenues from horizant product sales 
however  we have no experience in commercializing products on our own  and have only limited management expertise in developing a commercial operation 
to assume control of and to be prepared to commercialize horizant on 
table of contents may   we will need to continue to expand our organization and infrastructure substantially 
we expect that the expenses of establishing sales and marketing capabilities and a distribution and supply chain infrastructure will be substantial  and these costs may exceed any revenues that we are able to generate from horizant product sales 
if we are not able to build the appropriate capabilities and infrastructure prior to the horizant transition scheduled for may   we may not be able to assume control of horizant on may   sales of horizant could suffer and our business will be harmed 
in the six months ended december   gsk recorded net sales in the united states of horizant of million  and in the year ended december   gsk recorded net sales in the united states of horizant of million 
our future product sales of horizant will be dependent upon the success of our strategies for commercialization  promotion  manufacturing and distribution as well as our ability to successfully execute on these activities and to comply with applicable laws  regulations and regulatory requirements 
specifically  our strategy includes contracting with a contract sales organization that will focus our promotion on specialty doctors in certain geographic territories 
however  our commercialization strategy for horizant is unproven and our commercialization efforts may not be successful 
in addition  our lack of commercialization experience  as an organization and with respect to horizant product sales  will make future operating results difficult to predict 
gabapentin enacarbil is licensed to astellas pharma inc in japan and five other asian countries 
in july  astellas initiated sales of regnite in japan 
we are entitled to receive percentage based high teen royalties on net sales of regnite in japan  and the royalties will be recognized when royalty payments are received 
during the year ended december   royalty revenue from net sales of regnite in japan was only million 
we expect royalty revenues from our collaboration with astellas to fluctuate based on the results of their commercialization  marketing and distribution efforts of regnite in japan 
additionally  we expect revenues to fluctuate to the extent we enter into new collaborative agreements for our marketed product or any of our product candidates 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase in primarily due to the ap phase spasticity and xp development programs as well as regulatory costs related to the commercialization of horizant 
the timing and amount of research and development expenses incurred will primarily depend upon the extent of current or future clinical trials for ap and xp and post marketing requirements for horizant as well as the related expenses associated with our development organization  regulatory requirements for our product candidates and horizant  advancement of our preclinical program and product candidate manufacturing costs 
our future research and development expenses are subject to numerous assumptions that may prove to be wrong and also are subject to risks related to the difficulty and uncertainty of clinical success and regulatory approvals of our product candidates 
on july   we completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share  including  shares representing the exercise in full of the over allotment option granted to the underwriters 
net cash proceeds from the public offering were million  after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us 
we believe that our existing capital resources  together with interest thereon  will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements into the second quarter of however  we have based our estimate of cash sufficiency on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect 
further  our operating plan may change  and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements for product development and commercialization sooner than planned 
we have no credit facility or committed sources of capital other than potential contingent event based and royalty payments that we are eligible to receive under our collaboration agreement with astellas 
pursuant to the termination and transition agreement with gsk  upon the expiration of the transition period  we will be responsible for all horizant commercialization and development activities  including all post marketing requirements and commitments 
such costs could be greater than we anticipate  and sales of horizant may be less than we anticipate  which could accelerate our need for additional capital 

table of contents critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments related to each of our critical accounting areas 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition revenue arrangements entered into  or materially modified  through december  are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of the revenue recognition multiple element arrangements topic of the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification  or the codification 
a variety of factors were considered in determining the appropriate method of revenue recognition under these arrangements  such as whether the various elements could be considered separate units of accounting  whether there was objective and reliable evidence of fair value for these elements and whether there was a separate earnings process associated with a particular element of an agreement 
the provisions of accounting standards update  or asu   multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu  which is included within the codification as revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  will be applied by us to revenue arrangements entered into  or materially modified  beginning january  under the provisions of asu  we will use a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which will be used to determine the allocation of consideration to each unit of accounting under an arrangement 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence if available  third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence is available 
as of december   we had not applied the provisions of asu to any of our revenue arrangements as we had not entered into any new  or materially modified any current revenue arrangements in or the provisions of asu  milestone method of revenue recognition  or asu  which is included within the codification as revenue recognition milestone method  are being applied by us on a prospective basis for milestones achieved starting in where there are multiple deliverables combined as a single unit of accounting  revenues are deferred and recognized over the period during which we remain obligated to perform services 
the specific methodology for the recognition of the revenue eg  straight line or according to specific performance criteria is determined on a case by case basis according to the facts and circumstances applicable to a given agreement 
for contracts with specific performance criteria  we utilize the performance based expected revenue method of revenue recognition  which requires that we estimate the total amount of costs to be expended for a given unit of accounting and then recognize revenue equal to the portion of costs expended to date 
the estimated total costs to be expended are subject to revision from time to time as the underlying facts and circumstances change 
payments received in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenue until such time as the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
collaboration revenue includes revenue from our current collaboration agreement with astellas 
net revenue from unconsolidated joint operating activities included all revenue that resulted solely from our terminated collaboration agreement with gsk 
we account for the revenue related activities of these collaboration agreements as follows up front  licensing type payments 
up front  licensing type payments are assessed to determine whether or not the licensee is able to obtain any stand alone value from the license 
where this is not the case  we 
table of contents do not consider the license deliverable to be a separate unit of accounting  and the revenue is deferred with revenue recognition for the license fee being assessed in conjunction with the other deliverables that constitute the combined unit of accounting 
milestones 
under the provisions of asu  consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a milestone can be recognized in its entirety as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved 
recognition will occur only if the consideration earned from the achievement of a milestone meets all the criteria for the milestone to be considered substantive at the inception of the arrangement  such that it i is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the item delivered as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone  ii relates solely to past performance  and iii is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement 
the provisions of asu do not apply to contingent payments for which payment is either contingent solely upon the passage of time or the result of a collaborative partner s performance 
we will assess the nature of  and appropriate accounting for  these payments on a case by case basis in accordance with the provisions of the revenue recognition topic of the codification 
profit and loss sharing 
this represented our share of the profits and losses from the co promotion of horizant with gsk until the termination of our collaboration agreement 
amounts were recognized in the period in which the related activities occurred  and their financial statement classification was based on our assessment that these activities constituted part of our ongoing central operations 
product royalties 
we are entitled to receive royalties on net sales of regnite in the astellas territory 
astellas initiated sales of regnite in japan in july  and we recognize the associated product royalties when they can be reliably measured and collectability is reasonably assured generally upon receipt of the royalty payment 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us 
we periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with selected service providers and make adjustments  if necessary 
to date  we have not adjusted our estimate at any particular balance sheet date by any material amount 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with preclinical and toxicology studies and clinical trials  fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials  fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of clinical trial materials  and professional service fees 
we base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation  vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period 
if we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services  our actual expenses could differ from our estimates 

table of contents fair value measurements the carrying amounts of certain of our financial instruments  including cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  are stated at fair value 
we account for the fair value of our financial instruments in accordance with the provisions of the fair value measurement topic of the codification 
fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
we apply the market approach valuation technique for fair value measurements on a recurring basis and attempt to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels 
all of our cash equivalents and short term investments are measured using inputs classified at level or level within the fair value hierarchy 
level inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets 
level inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets 
level inputs are unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
where applicable  these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market based observable inputs obtained from various third party data providers  including but not limited to  benchmark yields  interest rate curves  reported trades  broker dealer quotes and market reference data 
stock based compensation the provisions of the compensation stock compensation topic of the codification establish accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee services 
in accordance with the topic  for stock options  awards and stock purchase rights granted under the employee stock purchase plan  stock based compensation cost is measured on the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the requisite employee service period 
we estimate the fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights using a black scholes valuation model 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model  and the resulting charge is expensed using the straight line attribution method over the vesting period 
restricted stock units are measured at the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant and expensed over the period of vesting using the straight line attribution approach 
the compensation stock compensation topic of the codification requires the use of option pricing models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short lived  exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
historically  we derived both the expected life and the expected stock price volatility assumptions using data obtained from similar entities  taking into consideration factors such as industry  stage of life cycle  size and financial leverage 
on a prospective basis  beginning in the first quarter of  we have determined that our historical volatility can be used as a reasonable basis to derive the expected stock price volatility assumption and have applied our historical volatility when valuing employee stock options granted beginning in the first quarter of we account for stock compensation arrangements to non employees in accordance with the equity based payments to non employees topic of the codification  using a fair value approach 
the compensation costs of these arrangements are subject to remeasurement over the vesting terms as earned 
nonretirement postemployment benefits on may   we adopted the xenoport amended and restated severance plan  or the severance plan  for the benefit of our non executive employees 
under the terms of the severance plan  a non executive employee terminated by us because of elimination of his or her position is eligible to receive 
table of contents continuation of medical insurance under cobra and specified severance payments based on the employee s level and years of service with us 
we account for employee termination benefits in accordance with the provisions of the compensation nonretirement postemployment benefits topic of the codification and record employee termination liabilities once they are both probable and estimable for severance provided under our existing severance program 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consisted of costs associated with both partnered and unpartnered research activities  as well as costs associated with our drug discovery efforts  conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials  manufacturing development efforts and activities related to regulatory filings 
research and development expenses are comprised of external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with i third party contract research organizations and investigative sites  where a substantial portion of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials are conducted  ii third party manufacturing organizations  where a substantial portion of our preclinical supplies and all of our clinical supplies are produced and iii consultants  employee related expenses  which include salaries and benefits  and facilities  depreciation and amortization and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities  depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment and laboratory and other supplies 
we use our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple research projects  including our drug development programs 
we do not allocate our employee and infrastructure costs on a project by project basis 
our current portfolio of proprietary product candidates is summarized in the table below 
the table summarizes development initiatives  including the related stages of development and the direct  third party research and development expenses recognized in connection with each of our product candidates 
the information in the column labeled estimated completion of current phase is our current estimate of the timing of completion of the current phase of development 
the actual timing of completion could differ materially from the estimates provided in the table 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing of completing a product development phase  see the our success also depends substantially on our product candidates that are still under development 
if we are unable to bring any of these product candidates to market  or experience significant delays in doing so  our ability to generate product revenue and our likelihood of success will be reduced  if third parties do not manufacture horizant  regnite or our product candidates in sufficient quantities or at an acceptable cost  commercialization of horizant and regnite and clinical development and commercialization of our product candidates would be harmed or delayed  if we are required to obtain alternate third party manufacturers  it could delay or prevent the clinical development and commercialization of our product candidates  use of third party manufacturers may increase the risk that we will not have adequate supplies of horizant or our product candidates  if our preclinical studies do not produce successful results or our clinical trials do not demonstrate safety and efficacy in humans  we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates  any failure or delay in commencing or completing clinical trials for our product candidates could severely harm our business  we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials 
if these third parties do not perform as contractually required or expected  we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for  or commercialize  our product candidates  if we or astellas are not able to obtain or maintain required regulatory approvals  we or astellas will not be able to commercialize horizant  regnite or our product candidates  our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired and our business will not be successful  and if we do not establish collaborations for our product candidates  we will have to alter our development and commercialization plans sections of risk factors

other constitutes preclinical and clinical development costs for our marketed product and product candidates that are not directly allocated to ap  xp or xp for the year ended december   other expenses consisted primarily of personnel costs of million and office and facilities overhead costs of million 
research expenses for the year ended december  consisted primarily of personnel costs and office and facilities overhead costs 
as a result of our focus on advancement of our later stage product candidates and to reduce expenses  we eliminated our discovery research efforts in the remaining office and facilities overhead costs were reclassified to the preclinical and clinical development other expenses for the year ended december  the largest component of our total operating expenses is our ongoing investment in our research and development activities  including the clinical development of our product candidate pipeline 
the process of conducting the clinical research necessary to obtain fda approval is costly and time consuming 
we consider the active management and development of our clinical pipeline to be critical to our long term success 
the actual probability of success for each product candidate and clinical program may be impacted by a variety of factors  including  among others  the quality of the product candidate  early clinical data  investment in the program  competition  manufacturing capability and commercial viability 
furthermore  our strategy includes entering into additional collaborations with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of at least some of our product candidates 
in situations in which third parties have control over the preclinical development or clinical trial process for a product candidate  the estimated completion date is largely under the control of that third party and not under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our product candidates  if any  will be subject to future collaborations or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates 

table of contents results of operations years ended december   and revenues our collaboration revenue consisted of the recognition of revenues from up front and milestone payments from our collaboration with astellas 
our royalty revenue is also from our collaboration with astellas 
our net revenue from unconsolidated joint operating activities consisted of the recognition of revenues from up front  milestone and contingent event based payments and the recognition of our share of operating losses resulting from our election to co promote horizant in the united states with gsk 
in connection with the amendment and restatement of our collaboration agreement with gsk in november  our share of operating losses was forgiven up to a maximum of million  and as a result  we did not share in any losses under the collaboration 
on november   we reached an agreement with gsk to terminate the amended and restated collaboration agreement 
under the terms of the termination and transition agreement  during a transition period that will end on april   gsk will continue to exclusively commercialize  promote  manufacture and distribute horizant in the united states 
we will not be responsible for any losses associated with the terminated collaboration agreement  are not eligible to receive any further milestone and contingent payments from gsk  and we will not receive any revenue or incur any losses from gsk s sales of horizant during the transition period

our future product sales of horizant will be dependent upon the success of our 
table of contents strategies for commercialization  promotion  manufacturing and distribution as well as our ability to successfully execute on these activities and to comply with applicable laws  regulations and regulatory requirements 
we expect royalty revenues from our collaboration with astellas to fluctuate based on the results of their commercialization  marketing and distribution efforts for regnite in japan 
additionally  we expect revenues to fluctuate to the extent we enter into new collaborative agreements for our marketed product or any of our product candidates

gain on litigation settlement as a result of the termination and transition agreement that we entered into with gsk that provided for a mutual release of claims and resolved all ongoing litigation between the parties  we recorded a gain of million in the fourth quarter of restructuring charges as a result of the implementation of our march restructuring plan that resulted in a reduction in force of employees  or approximately of our workforce at the time  we recorded restructuring charges of million in the year ended december  the restructuring charges consisted primarily of million of leave of absence pay  severance and healthcare benefits  million of non cash stock based compensation and million of property and equipment write offs 
as of december   we had made all cash payments in association with this restructuring plan 
in december  as part of our ongoing evaluation of our facilities requirements in light of future plans  we recorded restructuring charges of million in the fourth quarter of in connection with the permanent cease use of the office space in a building at central expressway  santa clara  california

table of contents the decrease in interest and other income in compared to resulted primarily from awards that totaled million received and recognized in through the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program under section d of the internal revenue code of  as amended  which was enacted as part of the patient protection and affordable care act of  and  to a lesser extent  earnings on cash equivalents and short term investments 
liquidity and capital resources year ended december  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities capital expenditures included in investing activities above due to our significant research and development expenditures  we have generated cumulative operating losses since we incorporated in as such  we have funded our research and development operations primarily through sales of our equity securities  non equity payments from our collaborators and interest earned on investments 
at december   we had available cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
our cash and investment balances are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including corporate debt securities  investments backed by us government sponsored agencies and money market accounts 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested with regard to liquidity and capital preservation  and we seek to minimize the potential effects of concentration and degrees of risk 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the net cash used in operating activities in primarily reflected our net loss and  to a lesser extent  a gain on litigation settlement  net of stock premium in connection with the stock purchase agreement with gsk  partially offset by non cash stock based compensation 
the net cash used in operating activities in primarily reflected our net loss partially offset by non cash stock based compensation 
the net cash used in operating activities in primarily reflected our net loss and  to a lesser extent  changes in operating assets and liabilities  partially offset by non cash stock based compensation

net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the net cash provided by financing activities in  and primarily reflected the net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the exercise of stock options 
additionally  in  we recorded proceeds from issuance of common stock to gsk in connection with the stock purchase agreement of million 
we believe that our existing capital resources  together with interest thereon  will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements into the second quarter of we have based our estimate of cash sufficiency on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect 
further  our operating plan may change  and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements for product development and commercialization sooner than planned 
we have no credit facility or committed sources of capital other than potential contingent event based and royalty payments that we are eligible to receive under our collaboration agreement with astellas 
pursuant to the termination and transition agreement with gsk  upon the expiration of the transition period  we will be responsible for all horizant commercialization and development activities  including all post marketing requirements and commitments 
such costs could be greater than we anticipate  and sales of horizant may be less than we anticipate  which could accelerate our need for additional capital 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement and involves risks and 
table of contents uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed in risk factors 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our marketed product and product candidates  and the extent to which we enter into additional collaborations with third parties to participate in their development and commercialization  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations 
we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
to achieve our objectives  we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities of high credit quality 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million consisting of cash and highly liquid investments deposited in highly rated financial institutions in the united states 
a portion of our investments may be subject to interest rate risk and could fall in value if market interest rates increase 
however  because our investments are short term in duration  we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk is not significant and a movement in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on the total value of our portfolio 
we actively monitor changes in interest rates 
from time to time  we are subject to exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates in connection with agreements with certain foreign contract manufacturers 
to date  the effect of the exposure to these fluctuations in foreign exchange rates has not been material  and we do not expect it to be material in the foreseeable future 
we do not hedge our foreign currency exposures 
we have not used derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes
