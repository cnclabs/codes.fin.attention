item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
fluctuations in economic  equity and credit market conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  our liquidity or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms 
should the economic  equity and credit market conditions become disrupted  our ability to raise equity or obtain capital  to repay or refinance credit facilities at maturity  pay significant capital expenditures or fund growth may be costly and or impaired 
our access to debt financing in particular will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions  the general availability of credit  the overall availability of credit to our industry  our credit history and credit capacity  as well as the historical performance of our businesses and lender perceptions of their and our financial prospects 
in the event we are unable to obtain debt financing  particularly as significant credit facilities mature  our internal sources of liquidity may not be sufficient 

table of contents economic conditions may also increase our counterparty risk  particularly in those businesses whose revenues are determined under multi year contracts  such as imtt and district energy 
should conditions deteriorate  we would expect to see increases in counterparty defaults and or bankruptcies  which could result in an increase in bad debt expense and may cause our operating results to decline 
the volatility in the financial markets makes projections regarding future obligations under pension plans difficult 
two of our businesses  hawaii gas and imtt  have defined benefit retirement plans 
future funding obligations under those plans depend in large part on the future performance of plan assets and the mix of investment assets 
our defined benefit plans hold a significant amount of equity securities as well as fixed income securities 
if the market values of these securities decline or if interest rates decline  our pension expense and cash funding requirements would increase and  as a result  could materially adversely affect the results and liquidity of these businesses and the company 
if borrowing costs increase or if debt terms become more restrictive  the cost of refinancing and servicing our debt will increase  reducing our profitability and ability to freely deploy free cash flow 
the majority of indebtedness at our primary businesses matures within one to four years 
refinancing this debt may result in substantially higher interest rates or margins or substantially more restrictive covenants 
any of these could limit operational flexibility or reduce dividends and or distributions from our operating businesses to us  which would have an adverse impact on our ability to freely deploy free cash flow 
we cannot provide assurance that we or the other owners of any of our businesses will be able to make capital contributions to repay some or all of the debt if required 
the debt facilities at our businesses contain terms that become more restrictive over time  with stricter covenants and increased amortization schedules 
those terms will limit our ability to freely deploy free cash flow 
security breaches or interruptions in our information systems could materially adversely affect our business 
we rely on information technology networks and systems to process  transmit and store electronic information used to operate our businesses 
we also share certain information technology networks with our manager 
the information technology infrastructure we use  as well as the information technology systems used by our manager  could be vulnerable to security breach  damage or interruption from computer viruses  cyber attacks  cyber terrorism  natural disasters or telecommunications failures 
if our technology systems were to fail or be breached and we were unable to recover in a timely manner  we may be unable to fulfill critical business functions and confidential data could be compromised  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
unfavorable publicity or public perception of the industries in which we operate could adversely impact our operating results and our reputation 
accidents and incidents involving the aviation industry  particularly those involving the airports and heliport at which we operate  whether or not directly related to the company s services  and the media coverage thereof  can adversely impact the company s reputation and the demand for our services 
similarly  negative publicity or public perception of the energy related industries in which we operate  including through media coverage of environmental contamination and climate change concerns  could reduce demand for our services and harm our reputation 
any reduction in demand for the services our businesses provide or damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business prospects 
our businesses are subject to environmental risks that may impact our future profitability 
our businesses including businesses in which we invest are subject to numerous statutes  rules and regulations relating to environmental protection 
atlantic aviation is subject to environmental protection requirements relating to the storage  transport  pumping and transfer of fuel  and district energy is subject to requirements relating mainly to its handling of significant amounts of hazardous materials 
hawaii gas is subject to risks and hazards associated with the refining  handling  storage and transportation of combustible products 
these risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury  loss of life  damage or 
table of contents destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage 
any losses we face could be greater than insurance levels maintained by our businesses  which could have an adverse effect on their and our financial results 
in addition  disruptions to physical assets could reduce our ability to serve customers and adversely affect sales and cash flows 
imtt s operations in particular are subject to complex  stringent and expensive environmental regulation and future compliance costs are difficult to estimate with certainty 
imtt also faces risks relating to the handling and transportation of significant amounts of hazardous materials 
failure to comply with regulations or other claims may give rise to interruptions in operations and civil or criminal penalties and liabilities that could adversely affect the profitability of this business and the distributions it makes to us  as could significant unexpected compliance costs 
further  these rules and regulations are subject to change and compliance with any changes that could result in a restriction of the activities of our businesses  significant capital expenditures and or increased ongoing operating costs 
a number of the properties owned by imtt have been subject to environmental contamination in the past and require remediation for which imtt is liable 
these remediation obligations exist principally at imtt s bayonne and lemont facilities and could cost more than anticipated or could be incurred earlier than anticipated  or both 
in addition  imtt may discover additional environmental contamination at its bayonne  lemont or other facilities that may require remediation at significant cost to imtt 
further  the past contamination of the properties owned by imtt  including by former owners or operators of such properties  could result in remediation obligations  personal injury  property damage  environmental damage or similar claims by third parties 
we may also be required to address other prior or future environmental contamination  including soil and groundwater contamination that results from the spillage of fuel  hazardous materials or other pollutants 
under various federal  state  local and foreign environmental statutes  rules and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for noncompliance with applicable environmental and health and safety requirements and for the costs of investigation  monitoring  removal or remediation of hazardous materials 
these laws often impose liability  whether or not the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of hazardous materials 
persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous materials may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of those materials at the disposal or treatment facility  whether or not that facility is or ever was owned or operated by that person and whether or not the original disposal or treatment activity accorded with all regulatory requirements 
the presence of hazardous materials on a property could result in personal injury  loss of life  damage or destruction of property and equipment  environmental damage and or claims by third parties that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results 
climate change  climate change regulations and greenhouse effects may adversely impact our operations and markets 
climate change is receiving increased attention from the scientific and political communities 
there is an ongoing debate as to the extent to which our climate is changing  the possible causes of this change and its potential impacts 
some attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases  including carbon dioxide  which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions 
the outcome of federal and state actions to address global climate change could result in significant new regulations  additional changes to fund energy efficiency activities or other regulatory actions 
these actions could increase the costs of operating our businesses  reduce the demand for our products and services and impact the prices we charge our customers  any or all of which could adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  climate change could make severe weather events more frequent  which would increase the likelihood of capital expenditures to replace damaged infrastructure at our businesses 
energy efficiency and technology advances  as well as conservation efforts  may result in reduced demand for our products and services 
the trend toward increased conservation  as well as technological advances  including installation of improved insulation  the development of more efficient heating and cooling devices and advances in energy generation technology  may reduce demand for certain of our products and services 
during periods of high 
table of contents energy commodity costs  the prices of certain of our products and services generally increase  which may lead to customer conservation 
in addition  federal and or state regulation may require mandatory conservation measures  which would also reduce demand 
a reduction in demand for our products and services could adversely affect our results of operations 
our businesses are dependent on our relationships  on a contractual and regulatory level  with government entities that may have significant leverage over us 
government entities may be influenced by political considerations to take actions adverse to us 
our businesses generally are  and will continue to be  subject to substantial regulation by governmental agencies 
in addition  our businesses rely on obtaining and maintaining government permits  licenses  concessions  leases or contracts 
government entities  due to the wide ranging scope of their authority  have significant leverage over us in their contractual and regulatory relationships with us that they may exercise in a manner that causes us delays in the operation of our businesses or pursuit of our strategy  or increased administrative expense 
furthermore  government permits  licenses  concessions  leases and contracts are generally very complex  which may result in periods of non compliance  or disputes over interpretation or enforceability 
if we fail to comply with these regulations or contractual obligations  we could be subject to monetary penalties or we may lose our rights to operate the affected business  or both 
where our ability to operate an infrastructure business is subject to a concession or lease from the government  the concession or lease may restrict our ability to operate the business in a way that maximizes cash flows and profitability 
further  our ability to grow our current and future businesses will often require consent of numerous government regulators 
increased regulation restricting the ownership or management of us assets  particularly infrastructure assets  by non us persons  given the non us ultimate ownership of our manager  may limit our ability to pursue acquisitions 
any such regulation may also limit our manager s ability to continue to manage our operations  which could cause disruption to our businesses and a decline in our performance 
in addition  any required government consents may be costly to seek and we may not be able to obtain them 
failure to obtain any required consents could limit our ability to achieve our growth strategy 
our contracts with government entities may also contain clauses more favorable to the government counterparty than a typical commercial contract 
for instance  a lease  concession or general service contract may enable the government to terminate the agreement without requiring them to pay adequate compensation 
in addition  government counterparties also may have the discretion to change or increase regulation of our operations  or implement laws or regulations affecting our operations  separate from any contractual rights they may have 
governments have considerable discretion in implementing regulations that could impact these businesses 
governments may be influenced by political considerations to take actions that may hinder the efficient and profitable operation of our businesses and investments 
many of our contracts  especially those with government entities or quasi government entities are long term contracts 
these long term contracts may be difficult to replace if terminated 
in addition  buy out or other early termination provisions could adversely affect our results of operations if exercised before the end of the contract 
governmental agencies may determine the prices we charge and may be able to restrict our ability to operate our businesses to maximize profitability 
where our businesses or investments are sole or predominant service providers in their respective service areas and provide services that are essential to the community  they are likely to be subject to rate regulation by governmental agencies that will determine the prices they may charge 
we may also face fees or other charges imposed by government agencies that increase our costs and over which we have no control 
we may be subject to increases in fees or unfavorable price determinations that may be final with no right of appeal or that  despite a right of appeal  could result in our profits being negatively affected 
in addition  we may have very little negotiating leverage in establishing contracts with government entities  which may decrease the prices that we otherwise might be able to charge or the terms upon which we provide products or services 
businesses and investments we acquire in the future may also be subject to rate regulation or similar negotiating limitations 

table of contents our income may be affected adversely if additional compliance costs are required as a result of new safety  health or environmental regulation 
our businesses and investments are subject to federal  state and local safety  health and environmental laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations affect all aspects of their operations and are frequently modified 
there is a risk that any one of our businesses or investments may not be able to comply with some aspect of these laws and regulations  resulting in fines or penalties 
additionally  if new laws and regulations are adopted or if interpretations of existing laws and regulations change  we could be required to increase capital spending and incur increased operating expenses in order to comply 
because the regulatory environment frequently changes  we cannot predict when or how we may be affected by such changes 
environmental emissions and other compliance testing technologies continue to improve  which may result in more stringent  targeted environmental regulations and compliance obligations in the future  for example at imtt  the costs of which could be material and adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations 
a significant and sustained increase in the price of oil could have a negative impact on the revenue of a number of our businesses 
a significant and sustained increase in the price of oil could have a negative impact on the profitability of a number of our businesses 
higher prices for jet fuel could result in less use of aircraft by general aviation customers  which would have a negative impact on the profitability of atlantic aviation 
higher fuel prices could increase the cost of power to our businesses generally which they may not be able to fully pass on to customers 
we may face a greater exposure to terrorism than other companies because of the nature of our businesses and investments 
we believe that infrastructure businesses face a greater risk of terrorist attack than other businesses  particularly those businesses that have operations within the immediate vicinity of metropolitan and suburban areas 
specifically  because of the combustible nature of the products of hawaii gas and consumer reliance on these products for basic services  the business sng plant  transmission pipelines  barges and storage facilities may be at greater risk for terrorism attacks than other businesses  which could affect its operations significantly 
any terrorist attacks that occur at or near our business locations would likely cause significant harm to our employees and assets 
in recent years  insurers have significantly reduced the amount of insurance coverage available for liability to persons other than employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism  war or similar events 
a terrorist attack that makes use of our property  or property under our control  may result in liability far in excess of available insurance coverage 
in addition  any terrorist attack  regardless of location  could cause a disruption to our business and a decline in earnings 
furthermore  it is likely to result in an increase in insurance premiums and a reduction in coverage  which could cause our profitability to suffer 
we are dependent on certain key personnel  and the loss of key personnel  or the inability to retain or replace qualified employees  could have an adverse effect on our businesses  financial condition and results of operations 
we operate our businesses on a stand alone basis  relying on existing management teams for day to day operations 
consequently  our operational success  as well as the success of our internal growth strategy  will be dependent on the continued efforts of the management teams of our businesses  who have extensive experience in the day to day operations of these businesses 
furthermore  we will likely be dependent on the operating management teams of businesses that we may acquire in the future 
the loss of key personnel  or the inability to retain or replace qualified employees  could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents risks related to imtt we share ownership and voting control of imtt with a third party co investor 
a representative and beneficiary of that co investor is currently the ceo of imtt 
our ability to exercise significant influence over the business or level of distributions from imtt is limited  and we have been  and we may again be negatively impacted by disagreements with our co investor regarding imtt s business and operations 
we own of imtt  the remaining is owned by a trust for the benefit of members of imtt s founding family 
our co investor currently manages the day to day operations of imtt  and our ability to influence the business is limited to our rights under the shareholders agreement governing our investment in imtt 
our co investor may fail to act in compliance with the shareholders agreement and may have other business interests that are inconsistent with our interests and goals  and may again take actions that are contrary to our business objectives and requests 
for example  management  operating under the express or implied direction of the ceo or the co investor  may oppose mic s interests in dealings with lenders  contractors  customers  suppliers  regulators and other third party stakeholders  as well mic s interests in normal business planning and budgeting processes 
we may not agree with our co investor as to the payment  amount or timing of distributions or as to transactions such as capital expenditures  acquisitions or dispositions of assets and financings 
disputes with our co investor have resulted in arbitration that has been costly and diverted the attention of our management 
our inability to exercise control over the management of imtt s business  could materially adversely affect imtt s and our results of operations 
mic s ability to enhance or change the senior management team is prohibited without consent of its co investor  a representative of whom is also the ceo of the business 
to the extent that our co investor and imtt senior management again act in ways inconsistent with their obligations to mic  further arbitration or litigation will be necessary to preserve mic s rights 
imtt s business is dependent on the demand for bulk liquid storage capacity in the locations where it operates 
demand for imtt s bulk liquid storage is largely a function of us domestic demand for chemical  petroleum and vegetable and animal oil products and  less significantly  the extent to which such products are imported into and or exported out of the united states 
us domestic demand for chemical  petroleum and vegetable and animal oil products is influenced by a number of factors  including economic conditions  growth in the us economy  the pricing of chemical  petroleum and vegetable and animal oil products and their substitutes 
import and export volumes of these products to and from the united states are influenced by demand and supply imbalances in the united states and overseas  the cost of producing chemical  petroleum and vegetable and animal oil products domestically versus overseas and the cost of transporting the products between the united states and overseas destinations 
specifically  production of natural gas from mainland north america may increase or decrease the demand for bulk liquid storage 
this situation continues to develop and the effects are not yet predictable 
in addition  changes in government regulations that affect imports and exports of bulk chemical  petroleum  renewable fuels and vegetable and animal oil products  including the imposition of surcharges or taxes on imported or exported products  could adversely affect import and export volumes to and from the united states 
a reduction in demand for bulk liquid storage  particularly in the new york harbor or the lower mississippi river  as a consequence of lower us domestic demand for  or imports exports of  chemical  petroleum or vegetable and animal oil products  could lead to a decline in storage rates and tankage volumes rented out by imtt and adversely affect imtt s revenue and profitability and the distributions it makes to us 
imtt s business could be adversely affected by a substantial increase in bulk liquid storage capacity in the locations where it operates 
an increase in available bulk liquid storage capacity in excess of growth in demand for such storage in the key locations in which imtt operates  such as new york harbor and the lower mississippi river  could result in overcapacity and a decline in storage rates and tankage volumes rented out by imtt and could adversely affect imtt s revenue and profitability and the distributions it makes to us 

table of contents imtt s business could be adversely affected by the insolvency of one or more large customers 
imtt has a number of customers that together generate a material proportion of imtt s revenue and gross profit 
in  imtt s ten largest customers by revenue generated approximately of terminal revenue 
the insolvency of any of these large customers could result in an increase in unutilized storage capacity in the absence of such capacity being rented to other customers and adversely affect imtt s revenue and profitability and the distributions it makes to us 
imtt s business involves hazardous activities and is partly located in a region with a history of significant adverse weather events and is potentially a target for terrorist attacks 
we cannot assure you that imtt is  or will be in the future  adequately insured against all such risks 
the transportation  handling and storage of petroleum  chemical and vegetable and animal oil products are subject to the risk of spills  leakage  contamination  fires and explosions 
any of these events may result in loss of revenue  loss of reputation or goodwill  fines  penalties and other liabilities 
in certain circumstances  such events could also require imtt to halt or significantly alter operations at all or part of the facility at which the event occurred 
imtt carries insurance to protect against most of the accident related risks involved in the conduct of the business  however  the limits of imtt s coverage mean imtt cannot insure against all risks 
in addition  because imtt s facilities are not insured against loss from terrorism or acts of war  such an attack that significantly damages one or more of imtt s major facilities would have a negative impact on imtt s future cash flow and profitability and the distributions it makes to us 
further  future losses sustained by insurers during hurricanes in the us gulf and northeast regions may result in lower insurance coverage and or increased insurance premiums for imtt s properties in louisiana 
risks related to hawaii gas disruptions or shutdowns at either of the oil refineries on oahu from which hawaii gas obtains both lpg and the primary feedstock for its sng plant may have an adverse effect on the operations of the business 
hawaii gas processes sng and distributes sng and lpg 
sng feedstock or lpg supply disruptions or refinery shutdowns that limit the business ability to process and or deliver gas to customers could increase costs as a result of an inability to source feedstock at rates comparable to those being paid currently 
the extended unavailability of one or both of the refineries or disruption to crude oil supplies or feedstock to hawaii could also result in an increased reliance on imported sources 
an inability to purchase lpg from foreign sources would adversely affect operations 
the business is also limited in its ability to store lpg  and any disruption in supply may cause a depletion of lpg stocks 
currently  the business has only one contracted source of feedstock for sng  the tesoro refinery 
the announced closure of the tesoro refinery and subsequent conversion to a terminal could significantly and adversely impact hawaii gas s utility business 
although a contingency plan to replace the feedstock is in place  an inability to execute this plan in a timely or cost effective manner could cause a significant disruption and potentially result in operating cost increases and or capital expenditures 
the business is also limited in its ability to store sng feedstock in the event of a disruption 
additional costs are likely to be incurred if tesoro is unsuccessful or unwilling to follow through with its announced plan to convert the refinery to a terminal 
all supply disruptions of sng or lpg  if occurring for an extended period  could adversely impact the business contribution margin and cash flows 
the most significant costs for hawaii gas are locally sourced lpg  lpg imports and feedstock for the sng plant  the costs of which are directly related to petroleum prices 
to the extent that these costs cannot be passed on to customers  the business contribution margin and cash flows will be adversely affected 
the profitability of hawaii gas is based on the margin of sales prices over costs 
since lpg and feedstock for the sng plant are commodities  changes in global supply of and demand for these products can have a significant impact on costs 
in addition  increased reliance on higher priced foreign sources of lpg  whether as a result of disruptions to or shortages in local sources or otherwise  could also have a significant impact on costs 
hawaii gas has no control over these costs  and  to the extent that these costs cannot be passed on to customers  the business financial condition and the results of operations would be adversely 
table of contents affected 
higher prices could result in reduced customer demand or customer conversion to alternative energy sources  or both  that would reduce the volume of gas sold and adversely affect the profitability of hawaii gas 
hawaii gas relies on its sng plant  including its transmission pipeline  for a significant portion of its sales 
disruptions at that facility could adversely affect the business ability to serve customers 
disruptions at the sng plant resulting from mechanical or operational problems or power failures could affect the ability of hawaii gas to produce sng 
most of the utility sales on oahu are of sng and all sng is produced at the oahu plant 
disruptions to the primary and redundant production systems would have a significant adverse effect on hawaii gas s revenues and cash flows 
the operations of hawaii gas are subject to a variety of competitive pressures and the actions of competitors  particularly those involved in other energy sources  could have a materially adverse effect on operating results 
other fuel sources such as electricity  diesel  solar energy  geo thermal  wind  other gas providers and alternative energy sources may be substituted for certain gas end use applications  particularly if the price of gas increases relative to other fuel sources  whether due to higher costs or otherwise 
customers could  for a number of reasons  including increased gas prices  lower costs of alternative energy or convenience  meet their energy needs through alternative sources 
this could have an adverse effect on the business revenues and cash flows 
reductions in us military spending could result in a reduction in demand for gas in hawaii 
the us military has a significant presence in hawaii 
to the extent that federal spending cuts  including voluntary cuts in us military spending or mandatory cuts pursuant to sequestration  result in a reduced military presence in hawaii  such reductions could reduce the demand for gas products in hawaii 
hawaii gas s utility business is subject to regulation by the hawaii public utilities commission  or hpuc  and actions by the hpuc or changes to the regulatory environment may constrain the operation or profitability of the business 
if the business fails to comply with certain hpuc regulatory conditions  the profitability of hawaii gas could be adversely impacted 
the business agreed to regulatory conditions with the hpuc that address a variety of matters including a requirement that hawaii gas and hgc s ratio of consolidated debt to total capital does not exceed  and a requirement to maintain million in readily available cash resources at hawaii gas  hgc or mic 
the hpuc regulates all franchised or certificated public service companies operating in hawaii  prescribes rates  tariffs  charges and fees  determines the allowable rate of earnings in establishing rates  issues guidelines concerning the general management of franchised or certificated utility businesses  and acts on requests for the acquisition  sale  disposition or other exchange of utility properties  including mergers and consolidations 
any adverse decision by the hpuc concerning the level or method of determining utility rates  the items and amounts that may be included in the rate base  the returns on equity or rate base found to be reasonable  the potential consequences of exceeding or not meeting such returns  or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision in a rate or other proceeding  could have an adverse effect on the business 
hawaii gas s operations on the islands of hawaii  maui and kauai rely on lpg that is transported to those islands by jones act qualified barges from oahu and from non jones act vessels from foreign ports 
disruptions to service by those vessels could adversely affect the financial performance of the business 
the jones act requires that all goods transported by water between us ports be carried in us flag ships and that they meet certain other requirements 
the business has time charter agreements allowing the use of two barges that currently have a cargo capacity of approximately  gallons and  gallons of lpg  respectively 
the barges used by the business are the only two jones act qualified barges available in the hawaiian islands capable of carrying large volumes of lpg 
if the barges are unable to transport lpg from oahu and the business is not able to secure foreign source lpg or obtain an exemption to the jones act 
table of contents that would permit importation of a sufficient quantity of lpg from the mainland us  the profitability of the business could be adversely impacted 
if the barges require refurbishment or repair at a greater frequency than forecast  cash outflows for capital costs could adversely impact hawaii gas s results and cash flows 
hawaii gas is subject to risks associated with volatility in the hawaii economy 
tourism and government activities including the military are two of the largest components of hawaii s economy 
hawaii s economy is heavily influenced by economic conditions in the us and asia and their impact on tourism  as well as by government spending 
a large portion of hawaii gas s sales are generated by businesses that rely on tourism 
if the local economy deteriorates  the volume of gas sold could be negatively affected by business closures and or lower usage and adversely impact the business financial performance 
additionally  a lack of growth in the hawaiian economy could reduce the level of new residential construction  and adversely impact growth in volume from new residential customers 
a reduction in government activity  particularly military activity  or a shift by either away from the use of gas products  could also have a negative impact on hawaii gas s results 
because of its geographic location  hawaii  and in turn hawaii gas  is subject to earthquakes and certain weather risks that could materially disrupt operations 
hawaii is subject to earthquakes and certain weather risks  such as hurricanes  floods  heavy and sustained rains and tidal waves 
because the business sng plant  sng transmission line and several storage facilities are close to the ocean  weather related disruptions to operations are possible 
in addition  earthquakes may cause disruptions 
these events could damage the business assets or could result in wide spread damage to its customers  thereby reducing the volumes of gas sold and  to the extent such damages are not covered by insurance  the business revenues and cash flows 
because of its geographic location and the unique economy of hawaii  hawaii gas is subject to challenges in hiring and maintaining staff with specialized skill sets 
the changing nature of the hawaiian energy complex  combined with the impact of the global economic recession has had an impact on the company s staffing requirements 
volatility in feedstock prices  together with the impact of the state of hawaii s goals to reduce dependency on imported petroleum  requires staff with specialized knowledge of the energy sector 
because the resident labor pool in hawaii is both small  and oriented mainly to hawaii s basic industries  it is difficult to find individuals with the ideal skill sets 
moreover  relocation to hawaii is costly and often requires employees to make cultural and family adjustments not normally required for a change of employment 
the inability to source and retain staff with appropriate skill sets could adversely impact the performance of the business 
the renewable natural gas and lng initiative exposes hawaii gas to new supply  counterparty  facility and technology risks 
hawaii gas expects it will convert up to million gallons per year of animal fat and non food grade oils to renewable natural gas 
the technology used to produce renewable gas from non petroleum based feedstock is not widely used and must be customized by hawaii gas for its particular application 
hawaii gas may not be able to obtain sufficient quantities of feedstock from locally produced sources to satisfy its needs 
commencing april   hawaii gas must report the percentage of renewable and sustainable components in its feedstock to the hpuc 
in the event hawaii gas fails to produce a reasonable proportion of gas from renewable and sustainable sources  its reputation could be adversely impacted 
transporting of lng from the us mainland and utilization of lng by hawaii gas involves products  systems and technologies not previously employed by the business 
the application of these could result in higher than anticipated cost  systems failures and an inability to meet customer needs for gas services and consequent loss of revenue and reputational harm to hawaii gas 
risks related to district energy pursuant to the terms of a use agreement with the city of chicago  the city of chicago has rights that  if exercised  could have a significant negative impact on district energy 
in order to operate the district cooling system in downtown chicago  the business has obtained the right to use certain public ways of the city of chicago under a use agreement  which we refer to as the use 
table of contents agreement 
under the terms of the use agreement  the city of chicago retains the right to use the public ways for a public purpose and has the right in the interest of public safety or convenience to cause the business to remove  modify  replace or relocate its facilities at the expense of the business 
if the city of chicago exercises these rights  district energy could incur significant costs and its ability to provide service to its customers could be disrupted  which would have an adverse effect on the business financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the use agreement is non exclusive  and the city of chicago is entitled to enter into use agreements with the business potential competitors 
the use agreement expires on december  and may be terminated by the city of chicago for any uncured material breach of its terms and conditions 
the city of chicago may also require district energy to pay liquidated damages of  a day if the business fails to remove  modify  replace or relocate its facilities when required to do so  if it installs any facilities that are not properly authorized under the use agreement or if the district cooling system does not conform to the city of chicago s standards 
each of these non compliance penalties could result in substantial financial loss or effectively shut down the district cooling system in downtown chicago 
any proposed renewal  extension or modification of the use agreement requires approval by the city council of chicago 
extensions and modifications subject to the city of chicago s approval include those to enable the expansion of chilling capacity and the connection of new customers to the district cooling system 
the city of chicago s approval is contingent upon the timely filing of an economic disclosure statement  or eds disclosure required by illinois state law and chicago city ordinances to certify compliance with various laws and ordinances  by us and certain of the beneficial owners of our stock 
if any of these investors fails to file a completed eds form within days of the city of chicago s request or files an incomplete or inaccurate eds  the city of chicago has the right to refuse to provide the necessary approval for any extension or modification of the use agreement or to rescind the use agreement altogether 
if the city of chicago declines to approve extensions or modifications to the use agreement  district energy may not be able to increase the capacity of its district cooling system and pursue its growth strategy 
furthermore  if the city of chicago rescinds or voids the use agreement  the district cooling system in downtown chicago would be effectively shut down and the business financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected as a result 
a certain number of our investors may be required to comply with certain disclosure requirements of the city of chicago and non compliance may result in the city of chicago s rescission or voidance of the use agreement and any other arrangements district energy may have with the city of chicago at the time of the non compliance 
in order to secure any amendment to the use agreement with the city of chicago to pursue expansion plans or otherwise  or to enter into other contracts with the city of chicago  the city of chicago may require any person who owns or acquires or more of our llc interests to make a number of representations to the city of chicago by filing a completed eds 
our llc agreement requires that in the event that we need to obtain approval from the city of chicago in the future for any specific matter  including to expand the district cooling system or to amend the use agreement  we and each of our then investors would need to submit an eds to the city of chicago within days of the city of chicago s request 
in addition  our llc agreement requires each investor to provide any supplemental information needed to update any eds filed with the city of chicago as required by the city of chicago and as requested by us from time to time 
any eds filed by an investor may become publicly available 
by completing and signing an eds  an investor will have waived and released any possible rights or claims which it may have against the city of chicago in connection with the public release of information contained in the eds and also will have authorized the city of chicago to verify the accuracy of information submitted in the eds 
the requirements and consequences of filing an eds with the city of chicago will make compliance with the eds requirements difficult for our investors 
if any investor fails to comply with the eds requirements on time or the city of chicago determines that any information provided in any eds is false  incomplete or inaccurate  the city of chicago may rescind or void the use agreement or any other arrangements thermal chicago has with the city of chicago  and pursue any other remedies available to them 
if the city of chicago rescinds or voids the use agreement  the business district cooling system in downtown chicago would be effectively shut down and the business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected as a result 

table of contents the deteriorating financial condition of the city of chicago may provide it with the incentive to take positions on contracts with district energy that could have an adverse affect on the cash flows generated of the business 
district energy has several long term contracts with the city of chicago  some of which contain early buy out provisions  pursuant to which the city may terminate the contracts early 
the city may take an aggressive position on the buy outs in an effort to save costs  which may lead to disputes with the city 
in the event we are unable to resolve such disputes  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected  whilst we litigate or take other steps to protect our rights 
we may be required to incur significant litigation costs  and the attention of district energy s management may be diverted for extended periods 
if certain events within or beyond the control of district energy occur  district energy may be unable to perform its contractual obligations to provide chilling and heating services to its customers 
if  as a result  its customers elect to terminate their contracts  district energy may suffer loss of revenue 
in addition  district energy may be required to make payments to such customers for damages 
in the event of a shutdown of one or more of district energy s plants due to operational breakdown  strikes  the inability to retain or replace key technical personnel or events outside its control  such as an electricity blackout  or unprecedented weather conditions in chicago  district energy may be unable to continue to provide chilling and heating services to all of its customers 
as a result  district energy may be in breach of the terms of some or all of its customer contracts 
in the event that such customers elect to terminate their contracts with district energy as a consequence of their loss of service  its revenue may be materially adversely affected 
in addition  under a number of contracts  district energy may be required to pay damages to a customer in the event that a cessation of service results in loss to that customer 
northwind aladdin currently derives a majority of its operating cash flows from a contract with a single customer  the planet hollywood resort and casino  which emerged from bankruptcy several years ago 
if this customer were to enter into bankruptcy again  northwind s aladdin s contract may be amended or terminated and the business may receive no compensation  which could result in the loss of our investment in northwind aladdin 
northwind aladdin derives a majority of its cash flows from a contract with the planet hollywood resort and casino formerly known as the aladdin resort and casino in las vegas to supply cold and hot water and back up electricity 
the aladdin resort and casino emerged from bankruptcy immediately prior to district energy s acquisition of northwind aladdin in september of  and during the course of those proceedings  the contract with northwind aladdin was amended to reduce the payment obligations of the aladdin resort and casino 
if the planet hollywood resort and casino were to enter into bankruptcy again and a cheaper source of the services that northwind aladdin provides can be found  the current contract may be terminated or amended 
this could result in a total loss or significant reduction in district energy s income from northwind aladdin  for which the business may receive no compensation 
weather conditions and conservation efforts may negatively impact district energy s results of operations 
district energy s earnings are generated by the sale of cooling and heating services 
weather conditions that are significantly cooler than normal in district energy s service areas may negatively affect demand for the services it provides 
demand for its services may also be reduced by the conservation efforts of its customers and by any conservation mandated by regulations to curb the effects of climate change and global warming 
a reduction in demand for district energy s services could adversely affect district energy s results of operations 

table of contents risks related to atlantic aviation deterioration of business jet traffic at airports where atlantic aviation operates would decrease atlantic aviation s ability to refinance its debt 
as of december   atlantic aviation had total long term debt outstanding of million  consisting of million in term loan debt  million in capital expenditure facilities  and million in stand alone debt facility 
the terms of these debt arrangements require compliance with certain operating and financial covenants 
the ability of atlantic aviation to meet their respective debt service obligations and to refinance or repay their outstanding indebtedness will depend primarily upon cash produced by this business 
deterioration in the economy in general or in the aviation industry that results in less air traffic at airports that atlantic aviation services would have a material adverse impact on our business 
a large part of the business revenue is derived from fuel sales and other services provided to general aviation customers and  to a lesser extent  commercial air travelers 
an economic downturn could reduce the level of air travel  adversely affecting atlantic aviation 
general aviation travel is primarily a function of economic activity 
consequently  during periods of economic downturn  fbo customers are more likely to curtail air travel 
air travel and air traffic volume can also be affected by events that have nationwide and industry wide implications 
events such as wars  outbreaks of disease  severe weather and terrorist activities in the united states or overseas may reduce air travel 
local circumstances include downturns in the general economic conditions of the area where an airport is located or other situations in which the business major fbo customers relocates their home base or preferred fueling stop to alternative locations 
in addition  changes to regulations governing the tax treatment relating to general aviation travel  either for businesses or individuals  may cause a reduction in general aviation travel 
increased environmental regulation restricting or increasing the cost of aviation activities could also cause the business revenue to decline 
atlantic aviation is subject to a variety of competitive pressures  and the actions of competitors may have a material adverse effect on its revenue 
fbo operators at a particular airport compete based on a number of factors  including location of the facility relative to runways and street access  service  value added features  reliability and price 
many of atlantic aviation s fbos compete with one or more fbos at their respective airports and with fbos at nearby airports 
furthermore  leases related to fbo operations may be subject to competitive bidding at the end of their term 
some present and potential competitors may have or may obtain greater financial and marketing resources than atlantic aviation  which may negatively impact atlantic aviation s ability to compete at each airport or for lease renewal 
some competitors may aggressively or irrationally price their bids for airport concessions  which may limit the business ability to grow or renew its portfolio 
atlantic aviation s fbos do not have the right to be the sole provider of fbo services at any airport 
the authority responsible for each airport has the ability to grant other leases to other operators and new competitors could be established at those airports 
the addition of new competitors may reduce or impair atlantic aviation s ability to grow or improve its financial performance 
increased pricing competition at atlantic aviation may have an adverse effect on market share and fuel margins  causing a decline in the profitability of that business 
atlantic aviation s competitors may pursue more aggressive pricing strategies 
these competitors may operate fbos at a number of airports where atlantic aviation operates or at airports near where it operates 
excessive price discounting may cause fuel volume and market share decline  potential decline in hangar rentals and de icing and may result in increased margin pressure  adversely affecting the profitability of this business 

table of contents the termination for cause or convenience of one or more of the fbo leases would damage atlantic aviation s operations significantly 
atlantic aviation s revenue is derived from long term leases at airports in the us if atlantic aviation defaults on the terms and conditions of its leases  including upon insolvency  the relevant authority may terminate the lease without compensation 
in this case  atlantic aviation would then lose the income from that location and potentially the expected returns from prior capital expenditures 
atlantic aviation would also likely be in default under the loan agreements and be obliged to repay its lenders a portion or the entire outstanding loan amount 
any such events would have a material adverse effect on atlantic aviation s results of operations 
reductions in us military spending could result in a reduction in demand for services provided by atlantic aviation at certain airports in the us the us military operates non combat aircraft that are serviced at atlantic aviation fbos around the us and combat and non combat aircraft at certain airports where fuel and fuel related services are provided by atlantic aviation 
cuts in us military spending  to the extent they result in a reduction in the number of flights by military aircraft  could reduce fuel and non fuel revenue at atlantic aviation 
the transportation security administration  or tsa  is considering new regulations which could impair the relative convenience of general aviation and adversely affect demand for atlantic aviation s services 
the tsa has proposed new regulations known as the large aircraft security program lasp  which would require all us operators of general aviation aircraft exceeding  pounds maximum take off weight to implement security programs that are subject to tsa audit 
in addition  the proposed regulations would require airports servicing these aircraft to implement security programs involving additional security measures  including passenger and baggage screening 
the business believes these new regulations  if implemented  will affect many of atlantic aviation s customers and all of the airports at which it operates 
these rules  if adopted  could decrease the convenience and attractiveness of general aviation travel relative to commercial air travel and  therefore  may adversely impact demand for atlantic aviation s services 
the lack of accurate and reliable industry data can result in unfavorable strategic planning  mergers and acquisitions and macro pricing decisions 
the business uses industry and airport specific general aviation traffic data published by the faa to identify trends in the fbo industry 
the business also uses this traffic data as a key input to decision making in strategic planning  mergers and acquisitions and macro pricing matters 
however  as noted by the faa on their website  the data has several limitations and challenges 
as a result  the use of the faa traffic data may result in conclusions in strategic planning  mergers and acquisitions or macro pricing decisions that are ultimately unfavorable

if they fail to so perform  mic solar could incur substantial expenses and business disruptions which could materially adversely affect mic solar s financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
mic solar is exposed to the risk that counterparties under long term agreements will not perform their obligations in accordance with such agreements 
should they fail to so perform  mic solar may be required to acquire alternative purchasers of the power mic solar s power generation facilities produce 
the failure of any of the parties to perform in accordance with these agreements could adversely affect mic solar s results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
mic solar is the managing member of the operating llcs that own the solar generation facilities in arizona and texas 
mic solar s failure to uphold its obligations as managing member could materially adversely affect mic solar s financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
mic solar has entered into an operating llc agreement as managing member with its co investor for the solar generation facilities in arizona and texas 
as managing member  mic solar is obligated to perform 
table of contents certain actions  including providing certain reporting items to its co investor and in relation to filing tax returns 
as managing member  mic solar is also obligated to refrain from performing certain actions  including selling its interest to certain entities that would result in adverse economic outcomes to mic solar and its co investor due to tax regulations 
mic solar s failure to perform its obligations or to take any actions contrary to its obligations under the operating llc agreement could adversely affect mic solar s results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
risks related to ownership of our stock mic s inherently complex structure and financial reporting may make it difficult for some investors to value our llc interests 
we are a limited liability company structured as a non operating holding company of four operating businesses and one substantial  unconsolidated investment 
we have elected to be treated as a corporation for tax purposes 
our consolidated federal income tax group is comprised of two of our operating businesses 
our investment and one of our operating businesses file stand alone federal income tax returns 
to the extent we receive distributions either from our investment or operating business that is not a part of our tax group  and these distributions are characterized as a dividend for tax purposes as opposed to a return of capital  such distributions would be eligible for the federal dividends received deductions exclusion in calculating taxes 
these and other factors may make it difficult for some potential investors  particularly those without a moderate level of financial acumen  to accurately assess the value of our llc interests and may adversely impact the market for our llc interests 
our manager s decision to reinvest its quarterly base management fees and performance fees  as applicable  in llc interests or retain the cash will affect holders of llc interests differently 
our manager earned million and million in base management and performance fees  respectively  during these fees are based on the company s market capitalization and performance and maybe higher or lower than these levels in the future 
our manager  in its sole discretion  may elect to retain base management fees and performance fees  if applicable  paid in cash or to reinvest such payments in additional llc interests 
in the event the manager chooses not to reinvest the fees to which it is entitled in additional llc interests  the amount paid will reduce the cash that may otherwise be distributed as a dividend to all shareholders or used in the company s operations 
in the event the manager chooses to reinvest the fees to which it is entitled in additional llc interests  effectively returning the cash to us  such reinvestment will dilute existing shareholders by the increase in the percentage of shares owned by the manager 
either option may adversely impact the market for our llc interests 
our reported ebitda excluding non cash items and free cash flow will be lower if the manager elects to retain base management and or performance fees in cash as compared with its election to reinvest such base management and or performance fees in additional llc interests 
the amount by which these items are lower could be material 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations in part ii  item for further information on how we calculate these items and what management uses these items for 
our manager owns a significant portion of mic s shares outstanding 
a sale of all or a portion of the interests owned by our manager could be interpreted by the equity markets as a lack of confidence in the prospects of the company 
our manager  in its sole discretion  determines whether to reinvest base and performance fees in shares and whether to hold or sell those securities 
reinvestment of base and performance fees in additional shares during the past two years has substantially increased our manager s ownership stake in the company 
as of february   our manager owned of our outstanding llc interests 
if our manager decides  for reasons other than the performance and prospects of the company  to reduce its position in the company  such sales may be interpreted by some market participants as a lack of confidence in the company and put downward pressure on the market price of our shares 

table of contents our total assets include a substantial amount of goodwill and intangible assets 
the write off of a significant portion of intangible assets would negatively affect our reported earnings 
our total assets reflect a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets 
at december   goodwill and other intangible assets  net  represented approximately of total assets from continuing operations 
goodwill and other intangible assets were primarily recognized as a result of the acquisitions of our businesses and investments 
other intangible assets consist primarily of airport operating rights  customer relationships and trade names 
on at least an annual basis  we assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of goodwill and assess for impairment of other intangible assets with indefinite lives when there are triggering events or circumstances 
if the carrying value of the tested asset exceeds its estimated fair value  impairment is deemed to have occurred 
in this event  the amount is written down to fair value 
under current accounting rules  this would result in a charge to reported earnings 
we have recognized significant impairments in the past  and any future determination requiring the write off of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our reported earnings and total capitalization  and could be material 
our total assets include a substantial amount of goodwill  intangible assets and fixed assets 
the depreciation and amortization of these assets may negatively impact our reported earnings 
the high level of intangible and physical assets written up to fair value upon acquisition of our businesses generates substantial amounts of depreciation and amortization 
these non cash items serve to lower net income as reported in our statement of operations as well as our taxable income 
the generation of net losses or relatively small net income may contribute to a net operating loss nol carryforward that can be used to offset currently taxable income in future periods 
however  the continued reporting of little or negative net income may adversely affect the attractiveness of the company among some potential investors and may reduce the market for our llc interests 
our manager s affiliation with macquarie group limited and the macquarie group may result in conflicts of interest or a decline in our stock price 
our manager is an affiliate of macquarie group limited and a member of the macquarie group 
from time to time  we have entered into  and in the future we may enter into  transactions and relationships involving macquarie group limited  its affiliates  or other members of the macquarie group 
such transactions have included and may include  among other things  the entry into debt facilities and derivative instruments with members of the macquarie group serving as lender or counterparty  and financial advisory services provided to us by the macquarie group 
although our audit committee  all of the members of which are independent directors  is required to approve of any related party transactions  including those involving members of the macquarie group or its affiliates  the relationship of our manager to the macquarie group may result in conflicts of interest 
in addition  as a result of our manager s being a member of the macquarie group  negative market perceptions of macquarie group limited generally or of macquarie s infrastructure management model  or macquarie group statements or actions with respect to other managed vehicles  may affect market perceptions of our company and cause a decline in the price of our llc interests unrelated to our financial performance and prospects 
our manager can resign with days notice and we may not be able to find a suitable replacement within that time  resulting in a disruption in our operations  which could adversely affect our financial results and negatively impact the market price of our llc interests 
our manager has the right  under the management services agreement  to resign at any time with days notice  whether we have found a replacement or not 
the resignation of our manager will trigger mandatory repayment obligations under debt facilities at our operating companies other than imtt and hawaii gas 
if our manager resigns  we may not be able to find a new external manager or hire internal management with similar expertise within days to provide the same or equivalent services on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to do so quickly  our operations are likely to experience a disruption  our financial results could be adversely affected  perhaps materially  and the market price of our llc interests may decline substantially 
in addition  the coordination of our internal management  acquisition activities and supervision of our 
table of contents businesses and investments are likely to suffer if we were unable to identify and reach an agreement with a single institution or group of executives having the expertise possessed by our manager and its affiliates 
furthermore  if our manager resigns  the company and its subsidiaries will be required to cease use of the macquarie brand entirely  and change their names to remove any reference to macquarie 
this may cause the value of the company and the market price of our llc interests to decline 
in the event of the underperformance of our manager  we may be unable to remove our manager  which could limit our ability to improve our performance and could adversely affect the market price of our llc interests 
under the terms of the management services agreement  our manager must significantly underperform in order for the management services agreement to be terminated 
the company s board of directors cannot remove our manager unless our llc interests underperform a weighted average of two benchmark indices by more than in relative terms and more than in absolute terms in out of consecutive quarters prior to and including the most recent full quarter  and the holders of a minimum of of the outstanding llc interests excluding any llc interests owned by our manager or any affiliate of the manager vote to remove our manager  our manager materially breaches the terms of the management services agreement and such breach continues unremedied for days after notice  our manager acts with gross negligence  willful misconduct  bad faith or reckless disregard of its duties in carrying out its obligations under the management services agreement  or engages in fraudulent or dishonest acts  or our manager experiences certain bankruptcy events 
because our manager s performance is measured by the market performance of our llc interests relative to a benchmark index  even if the absolute market performance of our llc interests does not meet expectations  the company s board of directors cannot remove our manager unless the market performance of our llc interests also significantly underperforms the benchmark index 
if we were unable to remove our manager in circumstances where the absolute market performance of our llc interests does not meet expectations  the market price of our llc interests could be negatively affected 
certain provisions of the management services agreement and the operating agreement of the company makes it difficult for third parties to acquire control of the company and could deprive investors of the opportunity to obtain a takeover premium for their llc interests 
in addition to the limited circumstances in which our manager can be terminated under the terms of the management services agreement  the management services agreement provides that in circumstances where the stock ceases to be listed on a recognized us exchange as a result of the acquisition of stock by third parties in an amount that results in the stock ceasing to meet the distribution and trading criteria on such exchange or market  the manager has the option to either propose an alternate fee structure and remain our manager or resign  terminate the management services agreement upon days written notice and be paid a substantial termination fee 
the termination fee payable on the manager s exercise of its right to resign as our manager subsequent to a delisting of our llc interests could delay or prevent a change in control that may favor our shareholders 
furthermore  in the event of such a delisting  any proceeds from the sale  lease or exchange of a significant amount of assets must be reinvested in new assets of our company  subject to debt repayment obligations 
we would also be prohibited from incurring any new indebtedness or engaging in any transactions with shareholders of the company or its affiliates without the prior written approval of the manager 
these provisions could deprive shareholders of opportunities to realize a premium on the llc interests owned by them 
the operating agreement of the company  which we refer to as the llc agreement  contains a number of provisions that could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or discouraging a third party from acquiring  control of the company 
these provisions include 
table of contents restrictions on the company s ability to enter into certain transactions with our major shareholders  with the exception of our manager  modeled on the limitation contained in section of the delaware general corporation law  allowing only the company s board of directors to fill vacancies  including newly created directorships and requiring that directors may be removed only for cause and by a shareholder vote of  requiring that only the company s chairman or board of directors may call a special meeting of our shareholders  prohibiting shareholders from taking any action by written consent  establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to the company s board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by our shareholders at a shareholders meeting  having a substantial number of additional llc interests authorized but unissued  providing the company s board of directors with broad authority to amend the llc agreement  and requiring that any person who is the beneficial owner of or more of our llc interests make a number of representations to the city of chicago in its standard form of eds  the current form of which is included in our llc agreement  which is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to this report 
the market price and marketability of our llc interests may from time to time be significantly affected by numerous factors beyond our control  which may adversely affect our ability to raise capital through future equity financings 
the market price of our llc interests may fluctuate significantly 
many factors that are beyond our control may significantly affect the market price and marketability of our llc interests and may adversely affect our ability to raise capital through equity financings 
these factors include the following price and volume fluctuations in the stock markets generally  significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of macquarie group limited and or vehicles managed by the macquarie group or branded under the macquarie name or logo  significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of registered investment companies  business development companies or companies in our sectors  which may not be related to the operating performance of these companies  changes in our earnings or variations in operating results  any shortfall in ebitda excluding non cash items or free cash flow from levels expected by securities analysts  changes in regulatory policies or tax law  operating performance of companies comparable to us  and loss of funding sources 
risks related to taxation we have significant income tax net operating losses  or nols  which may not be realized before they expire 
we have million in federal nol carryforwards at december  while we have concluded that all but million of the nols will more likely than not be realized  there can be no assurance that we will utilize the nols generated to date or any nols we might generate in the future 
in addition  we have incurred state nols and have provided a valuation allowance against a portion of those 
as with our federal nols  there is also no assurance that we will utilize those state losses or future losses that maybe generated 
further  the state of illinois has suspended the use of nol carryforwards through  similar to the state of california s suspension of an nol deduction through for large corporations 
there can be no assurance 
table of contents that other states will not suspend the use of nol carryforwards or that california and illinois will not extend the suspension of the use of nol carryforwards 
our ability to use our nol carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations 
in general  under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  or the code  a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation  such as the company that undergoes an ownership change is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre change nols and certain other tax attributes to offset future taxable income 
generally speaking  an ownership change occurs if the aggregate percentage ownership of the stock of the corporation held by one or more five percent shareholders as defined in the code increases by more than fifty percentage points over such shareholders lowest percentage ownership during the testing period  which is generally the three year period ending on the transaction date 
if we undergo an ownership change  our ability to utilize nols and certain other tax attributes could be limited 
the current treatment of qualified dividend income and long term capital gains under current us federal income tax law may be adversely affected  changed or repealed in the future 
under current law  qualified dividend income and long term capital gains are taxed to non corporate investors at a maximum us federal income tax rate of beginning in this tax treatment may be adversely affected  changed or repealed by future changes in tax laws at any time 
in addition  certain holders that are individuals  estates or trusts are subject to surtax on all or a portion of their net investment income  which may include all or a portion of their dividend income and net gains from the disposition of our llc interests

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of macquarie infrastructure company llc should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere herein 
we own  operate and invest in a diversified group of infrastructure businesses that provide basic services  such as chilled water for building cooling and utility gas services to businesses and individuals primarily in the us the businesses we own and operate are a interest in international matex tank terminals  or imtt  hawaii gas  our controlling interest in district energy and mic solar  and atlantic aviation 
our infrastructure businesses generally operate in sectors with significant barriers to entry  including high initial development and construction costs  the existence of long term contracts or the requirement to obtain government approvals and a lack of immediate cost efficient alternatives to the services provided 
overall they tend to generate sustainable long term cash flows 
overview in analyzing the financial condition and results of operations of our businesses  we focus primarily on cash generation  and our ability to distribute cash to shareholders in particular 
the ability of our businesses to generate cash  broadly  is tied to their ability to effectively manage the volume of products services sold and the margin earned on those sales 
offsetting these are required payments on debt facilities  taxes and capital expenditures necessary to maintain the productivity of the fixed assets of the businesses  among others 
at imtt  we focus on the amount of storage under contract and the rates at which that storage is leased to third parties and on making appropriate expenditures in maintaining fixed assets of the business 
both storage rates and aggregate capacity grew in consistent with expectations for  mic believes that the average rates on all storage contracts in will increase between and 
capacity is expected to increase during with the commissioning of storage currently or soon to be under construction  while utilization may decline temporarily as tanks are removed from service for cleaning and inspection 
during the third quarter of  our gas processing and distribution business rebranded itself as hawaii gas 
at hawaii gas  our focus is on the number of customers served by each of the utility and non utility portions of the business  and in the case of the non utility portion  the margins achieved on sales of gas as well 
hawaii gas has an active marketing program that seeks to develop new customers throughout hawaii 
we periodically pursue rate cases that allow for adjustment of the rates in the utility portion of the business  although we do not intend to pursue any significant rate case in the pricing of non utility gas is adjusted to reflect changes in the cost of the product and the costs associated with delivering it to customers 
in addition to the existing utility and non utility operations  hawaii gas is advancing initiatives related to the distribution of liquefied natural gas  or lng 
this initiative to bring lng on a small scale is expected to begin in variation in the volume of gas sold by hawaii gas is a function of tourism and economic activity in hawaii generally 
the volume of gas sold in is expected to increase compared with net of decreases in demand related to conservation and substitution 
at district energy  we focus on attracting and maintaining relationships with building owners and managers such that they choose to install or continue to use the business cooling services 
absent a resurgence in new construction in downtown chicago  we expect district energy to produce financial results consistent with prior years  although full year results remain subject to slight variation based on the extent to which the temperatures and humidity in chicago are above or below historic norms 
the investment in mic solar affords us the opportunity to generate what we believe to be an attractive return 
we believe mic solar will generate a predictable and stable level of distributable cash with minimal operational risk and costs due to the simplicity of the physical facility and the existence of a robust operations and maintenance agreement with a highly reputable and experienced service provider 
mic solar constitutes a business segment that does not meet the threshold of a reportable segment 
accordingly  the results of operations of mic solar are aggregated with our corporate and other results 

table of contents imtt  hawaii gas  district energy and mic solar are largely resistant to economic downturns  primarily due to the contracted or utility like nature of their revenues combined with the essential services they provide and the contractual or regulatory ability to pass through most cost increases to customers 
we believe these businesses are generally able to generate consistent cash flows throughout the business cycle 
at atlantic aviation  our focus is on attracting and maintaining relationships with general aviation aircraft owners and pilots such that they are incentivized to use our fbos 
general aviation activity has improved since the first quarter of  although  forecasting flight activity levels remains difficult 
we believe that flight activity levels will continue to increase in  subject to continued economic recovery in the united states 
improvement in general aviation activity levels has resulted in improvement in the operating performance of atlantic aviation 
atlantic aviation is generating a substantial amount of cash  however a significant amount of the cash is being used to reduce atlantic aviation s indebtedness 
those repayments are expected to enhance the terms on which we may be able to refinance this debt 
distributions from imtt for fiscal year distributions received from imtt in totaled million  including million in distributions per the terms of the shareholder s agreement between mic and its co investor and million received as a result of a judgment delivered in march of included in the million in distributions in  was a payment of million for the fourth quarter that would ordinarily have been paid in the first quarter of income taxes we file a consolidated federal income tax return that includes the taxable income of hawaii gas and atlantic aviation 
imtt and district energy file separate federal income tax returns 
distributions from imtt and district energy may be characterized as non taxable returns of capital and reduce our tax basis in these businesses  or as a taxable dividend 
we will include in our taxable income the dividend portion of any distributions  which are eligible for the dividends received deduction 
we also receive and include in taxable income interest income from district energy on intercompany debt 
as a result of having federal net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards  we do not expect to make regular federal tax payments at least through the and into the tax year 
however  we expect to pay an alternative minimum tax of approximately  for  all of which is related to district energy 
we expect that the alternative minimum tax paid for will be available as a credit against regular federal income taxes in the future 
the cash state and local taxes paid by our individual businesses are discussed in the sections entitled income taxes for each of these businesses 
pursuant to the tax sharing agreements  the individual businesses included in our consolidated federal income tax return pay mic an amount equal to the federal income taxes each would have paid on a standalone basis if they were not part of the mic consolidated federal income tax return 
american taxpayer relief act of in january of  the american taxpayer relief act of the tax act was signed 
the act extends the period over which the bonus depreciation provided for in the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization act of applies to include the company expects to take the bonus depreciation provision into consideration when evaluating its maintenance and growth capital expenditure plans for tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of in december of  the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of the tax act was signed 
the tax act provides for tax depreciation for certain fixed assets placed in service after september  and before january   and tax depreciation for certain fixed assets placed in service during for federal income tax purposes 
generally  states do not allow this tax depreciation deduction in determining state taxable income 
importantly  illinois and louisiana  two states in which we have significant operations  do permit the use of federal tax depreciation deductions in 
table of contents calculating state taxable income 
the company took into consideration the benefits of these accelerated depreciation provisions of the tax act when evaluating its maintenance and growth capital expenditure plans for and taxpayer accountability and budget stabilization act in january of  illinois enacted the taxpayer accountability and budget stabilization act 
the legislation increases the corporate income tax rate to from for taxable years beginning on or after january  and prior to january   to for taxable years beginning on or after january  and prior to january   and returns the rate to for taxable years beginning on or after january  the legislation also suspends the use of state nol carryforwards until  and limits the annual utilization in through to  per year 
for purposes of determining the taxable years to which a net loss may be carriedforward  no taxable year for which a deduction is disallowed under this provision will be counted 
as discussed below in district energy s results of operations  the income tax expense for the year ended december  reflects a change in the deferred tax liability of this business consistent with the change in illinois law 
discontinued operations pcaa bankruptcy on june   we concluded the sale in bankruptcy of an airport parking business parking company of america airports or pcaa  resulting in a pre tax gain of million  of which million related to the forgiveness of debt and the elimination of million of current debt from liabilities from our consolidated balance sheet 
the results of operations from this business and the gain from the bankruptcy sale are separately reported as discontinued operations in the company s consolidated financial statements 
this business is no longer a reportable segment 
as a part of the bankruptcy sale process  substantially all of the cash proceeds were used to pay the creditors of this business and were not paid to us 
see note  discontinued operations  in our consolidated financial statements in financial statements and supplementary data in part ii  item  of this form k for financial information and further discussions 
operating segments and businesses imtt imtt provides bulk liquid storage and handling services in north america through ten terminals located on the east  west and gulf coasts  the great lakes region of the united states and two partially owned terminals in quebec and newfoundland  canada 
imtt s largest terminals are located in the lower mississippi river near new orleans and in new york harbor 
imtt stores and handles petroleum products  various chemicals  renewable fuels  and vegetable and animal oils 
based on storage capacity  imtt operates one of the largest independent bulk liquid storage terminal businesses in the united states 
the key drivers of imtt s revenue and gross profit include the amount of tank capacity rented to customers and the rental rates 
customers generally rent tanks under contracts with terms of three to five years 
payments are due regardless of actual tank usage 
demand for storage capacity within a particular region eg new york harbor serves as the key driver of storage capacity utilization and tank rental rates 
this demand reflects both the level of consumption of the bulk liquid products stored by the terminals as well as import and export activity of such products 
we believe major constraints on increases in the supply of new bulk liquid storage capacity in imtt s key markets have been and will continue to be limited by availability of waterfront land with access to the infrastructure necessary for land based receipt and distribution of stored product road  rail and pipelines  lengthy environmental permitting processes and high capital costs 
we believe a favorable supply demand imbalance for bulk liquid storage currently exists in many of the markets served by imtt s facilities 
this condition  when combined with the attributes of imtt s facilities such as deep water drafts and access to land based infrastructure  have allowed imtt to increase rental rates while maintaining high storage capacity utilization rates 
imtt earns revenue at its terminals from a number of sources including storage charges for bulk liquids per barrel  per month rental  throughput of liquids handling charges  heating a pass through of the cost associated with heating liquids to maintain viscosity and other revenue blending  packaging  warehousing  etc most customer contracts include provisions for annual price increases based on inflation 

table of contents imtt continued in operating its terminals  imtt incurs labor costs  fuel costs  repair and maintenance costs  real and personal property taxes and other costs which include insurance and other operating costs such as utilities and inventory used in packaging and drumming activities 
imtt owns the majority of the land on which it operates and therefore does not incur significant land lease or rental payments 
in  imtt generated approximately of its total terminal revenue and approximately of its terminal gross profit at its st 
rose  gretna  avondale and geismar facilities  which together service the lower mississippi river region with st 
rose being the largest contributor  and approximately of its total terminal revenue and approximately of its terminal gross profit at its bayonne facility  which serves the new york harbor market 
imtt also owns omi environmental solutions  or oil mop  an environmental emergency response  industrial services  waste transportation and disposal business 
oil mop has a network of facilities along the us gulf coast between houston and new orleans 
these facilities predominantly service the gulf region  but also respond to spill events and provide services as needed throughout the united states and internationally 
in  oil mop was involved in the clean up of the bp oil spill in the gulf of mexico and generated of imtt s total revenues 
oil mop s contribution to imtt s total revenues returned to a historical level of less than of imtt s total revenues during and our interest in imtt holdings  from the date of closing our acquisition on may   is reflected in our equity in earnings and amortization charges of investee line in our consolidated statements of operations 
cash distributions received by us in excess of our interest in imtt s earnings less amortization charges are reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows from investing activities under return on investment in unconsolidated business 
hawaii gas hawaii gas is hawaii s only government franchised full service gas company  processing and distributing gas products and services in hawaii 
the market includes hawaii s approximately million residents and approximately million visitors in hawaii gas processes and distributes synthetic natural gas  or sng  for its utility customers on oahu  and distributes liquefied petroleum gas  or lpg  to utility and non utility customers throughout the state s six primary islands 
hawaii gas has two primary businesses utility or regulated and non utility or unregulated the utility business serves approximately  customers through localized distribution systems located on the islands of oahu  hawaii  maui  kauai  molokai and lanai 
over of these customers are on oahu 
the utility business includes the processing  distribution and sale of sng on the island of oahu and distribution and sale of lpg on all of the islands mentioned above 
utility revenue consists principally of sales of sng and lpg 
the operating costs for the utility business include the cost of locally purchased feedstock  the cost of processing sng from the feedstock  lpg purchase costs and the cost of distributing sng and lpg to customers 
utility sales represented approximately of hawaii gas s total contribution margin in the non utility business sells and distributes lpg to approximately  customers 
trucks deliver lpg to individual tanks located on customer sites on oahu  hawaii  maui  kauai  molokai and lanai 
non utility revenue is generated primarily from the sale of lpg delivered to customers 
the operating costs for the non utility business include the cost of purchased lpg and the cost of distributing the lpg to customers 
non utility sales represented approximately of hawaii gas s total contribution margin in sng and lpg have a wide range of commercial and residential applications  including water heating  drying  cooking  emergency power generation and decorative lighting  such as tiki torches 
lpg is also used as a fuel for specialty vehicles such as forklifts and ramp equipment at airports 
gas customers include residential customers and a variety of commercial  hospitality  military  public sector and wholesale customers 

table of contents hawaii gas continued revenue is primarily a function of the volume of sng and lpg sold to customers and the price per thermal unit or gallon charged to customers 
because both sng and lpg are derived from crude oil  revenue levels  without volume changes  will generally track global oil prices 
utility revenue includes fuel adjustment charges through which the changes in feedstock costs are passed through to customers 
evaluating the performance of this business based on contribution margin removes the volatility associated with fluctuations in the price of feedstock 
prices charged by hawaii gas to its customers for the utility gas business are based on hpuc utility rates that enable the business to recover its costs of providing utility gas service  including operating expenses and taxes  and capital investments through recovery of depreciation and a return on the capital invested 
hawaii gas s rate structure generally allows it to maintain a relatively consistent dollar based margin per thermal unit by passing increases or decreases in fuel costs through to customers via fuel adjustment charges without filing a general rate case 
the rates that are charged to non utility customers are based on the cost of lpg plus delivery costs  the cost of alternative fuels and competitive factors 
hawaii gas incurs expenses in operating and maintaining its facilities and distribution network  comprising a sng plant  a mile transmission line   miles of distribution and service pipelines  several tank storage facilities and a fleet of vehicles 
these costs are generally fixed in nature 
other operating expenses incurred  such as for lpg  feedstock for the sng plant and revenue based taxes  generally fluctuate with the volume of product sold 
in addition  the business incurs general and administrative expenses at its executive office that include expenses for senior management  accounting  information technology  human resources  environmental compliance  regulatory compliance  employee benefits  rents  utilities  insurance and other normal business costs 
district energy district energy consists of thermal chicago and northwind aladdin  which are and indirectly owned by us  respectively 
thermal chicago sells chilled water under long term contracts to approximately customers in downtown chicago and one customer outside of the downtown area 
thermal chicago receives both capacity and consumption payments 
capacity payments cooling capacity revenue are received regardless of the volume of chilled water used by a customer and these payments generally increase in line with inflation 
consumption payments cooling consumption revenue are per unit charges for the volume of chilled water used 
such payments are higher in the second and third quarters of each year when the demand for building cooling is at its highest 
consumption payments also fluctuate moderately from year to year depending on weather conditions 
by contract  consumption payments generally increase in line with a number of indices that reflect the cost of electricity  labor and other input costs relevant to the operations of thermal chicago 
the weighting of the individual indices broadly reflects the composition of thermal chicago s direct expenses 
thermal chicago s principal direct expense is electricity 
other direct expenses are water  labor  operations and maintenance and depreciation and accretion 
electricity usage  and to a lesser extent water usage  fluctuates with the volume of chilled water produced 
other direct expenses are largely fixed regardless of the volume of chilled water produced 
thermal chicago has entered into a contract with a retail energy supplier to provide the majority of the business electricity needs at fixed prices in electricity for one of the plants is purchased by the landlord customer and the cost is passed through to the business 
thermal chicago passes through changes in electricity costs to its customers 
the business anticipates prices of electricity in supply contracts for and subsequent years will fluctuate based on underlying power costs 
northwind aladdin services customers a hotel casino complex  a condominium and a shopping mall in las vegas  nevada 
under its customer contracts  northwind aladdin receives monthly fixed payments totaling approximately million per year through march of and monthly fixed payments totaling approximately million per year thereafter through february of 
table of contents atlantic aviation the performance of atlantic aviation reflects the level of general aviation activity and jet fuel consumption 
general aviation activity is in turn a function of economic activity and demographic trends in the regions serviced by the airport at which the business operates and the general level of economic activity in the united states 
a number of the airports at which atlantic aviation operates are located near key business centers such as new york  chicago  philadelphia and houston as well as recreational destinations such as aspen  colorado and sun valley  idaho 
fuel gross profit is a function of the volume gallons sold and the average dollar margin per gallon 
the average price per gallon is based on the business cost of fuel plus  where applicable  fees and taxes paid to airports or other local authorities cost of revenue fuel  plus atlantic aviation s margin 
dollar based margins per gallon have been relatively insensitive to the wholesale price of fuel with both increases and decreases in the wholesale price of fuel generally passed through to customers  subject to the level of price competition that exists at the various fbos 
the average dollar based margin varies based on business considerations and customer mix 
base tenants generally benefit from price discounts based on a higher utilization of atlantic aviation s networks 
transient customers typically pay a higher price 
atlantic aviation also earns revenue from activities other than fuel sales non fuel revenue 
for example  atlantic aviation earns revenue from refueling some general aviation customers on a pass through basis  where it acts as a fueling agent for fuel suppliers 
atlantic aviation receives a fee for this service  generally calculated on a per gallon basis 
in addition  the business earns revenue from aircraft parking and hangar rental fees and by providing general aviation customers with other services  such as de icing 
at some airports atlantic aviation also earns revenue from refueling and de icing some commercial airlines on a fee for service basis 
expenses associated with non fuel revenue cost of revenue non fuel include de icing fluid costs and other costs directly related to the volume of service provided 
these costs generally increase in line with non fuel revenue 
atlantic aviation incurs expenses in operating and maintaining each fbo 
operating expenses include rent and insurance  which are generally fixed in nature and other expenses  such as salaries  that generally increase with the level of activity 
in addition  atlantic aviation incurs general and administrative expenses at the head office that include senior management expenses as well as accounting  information technology  human resources  environmental compliance and other corporate costs 
results of operations consolidated key factors affecting operating results for compared to an increase in average storage rates at imtt  higher volume of general aviation ga fuel sold and lower interest expense at atlantic aviation  and an increase in non utility contribution margin at hawaii gas  partially offset by performance fees incurred in  reduced spill response activity in compared with at imtt  and reduced de icing revenue at atlantic aviation

the difference between our effective tax rate and the us federal statutory rate of is primarily attributable to state and local income taxes and adjustments for our less than owned businesses 
for  we reported consolidated taxable income  although the tax thereon was fully offset by our nol carryforwards 
for  we reported a consolidated net operating loss  for which we recorded a deferred tax benefit 
further  our taxable income for included a capital loss of approximately million on the disposal of our airport parking business  which we carriedback to the carriedback eliminated our consolidated taxable income 
valuation allowance in calculating our consolidated state income tax provision  we have provided a valuation allowance for certain state income tax nol carryforwards  the utilization of which is not assured beyond a reasonable doubt 
in addition  we expect to incur certain expenses that will not be deductible in determining state taxable income 
accordingly  these expenses have also been excluded in determining our state income tax expense 
we increased the valuation allowance by million and million for and  respectively  for certain state nol carryforwards 
during we reduced the valuation allowance to approximately million  resulting in a net decrease of million 
of this decrease  million was recorded as part of the benefit for federal and state income taxes included in continuing operations on the consolidated statements of operations 
the remaining million of the decrease was included in net income from discontinued operations 
discontinued operations on june   we concluded the sale in bankruptcy of pcaa  resulting in a pre tax gain of million  of which million related to the forgiveness of debt 
the results of operations from this business and the gain from the bankruptcy sale are separately reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements and prior comparable periods have been restated to conform to the current period presentation 
see note  discontinued operations  in our consolidated financial statements in financial statements and supplementary data in part ii  item  of this form k for financial information and further discussions 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda excluding non cash items and free cash flow we have disclosed ebitda excluding non cash items for our company and each of our operating segments in note  reportable segments  in our consolidated financial statements in financial statements and supplementary data in part ii  item  of this form k  as a key performance metric relied on by management in evaluating our performance 
ebitda excluding non cash items is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and non cash items  which includes impairments  derivative gains and losses and adjustments for other non cash items reflected in the statements of operations 
we believe ebitda excluding non cash items provides additional insight into the performance of our operating businesses relative to each other and similar businesses without regard to their capital structure  and their ability to service or reduce debt  fund capital expenditures and or support distributions to the holding company 

table of contents results of operations consolidated continued we also disclose free cash flow  as defined by us  as a means of assessing the amount of cash generated by our businesses and supplementing other information provided in accordance with gaap 
we define free cash flow as cash from operating activities  less maintenance capital expenditures and changes in working capital  except for mic solar  for which we define free cash flow as distributions received from this business 
in relation to mic solar  determining our proportionate share of free cash flow  as defined by us historically  from mic solar is difficult due to the complexities of the changing ownership interests and different treatment of tax attributes and actual cash flows between the members over time 
therefore  we believe the most appropriate measure of our proportionate share of free cash flow from mic solar is the actual cash distributions received during the applicable period 
we believe that reporting free cash flow will provide our investors with additional insight into our future ability to deploy cash  as gaap metrics such as net income and cash from operating activities do not reflect all of the items that our management considers in estimating the amount of cash generated by our operating entities 
in this annual report on form k  we have disclosed free cash flow for our consolidated results and for each of our operating segments 
we note that free cash flow does not fully reflect our ability to freely deploy generated cash  as it does not reflect required payments to be made on our indebtedness and other fixed obligations or the other cash items excluded when calculating free cash flow 
we also note that free cash flow may be calculated in a different manner by other companies  which limits its usefulness as a comparative measure 
therefore  our free cash flow should be used as a supplemental measure and not in lieu of our financial results reported under gaap

the federal income tax expense exceeded the current taxes primarily due to the benefit of accelerated tax depreciation  which is discussed below 
for  imtt paid federal and state income taxes of million and million  respectively 
a significant difference between imtt s book and federal taxable income relates to depreciation of terminalling fixed assets 
for book purposes  these fixed assets are depreciated primarily over to years using the straight line method of depreciation 
for federal income tax purposes  these fixed assets are depreciated primarily over to years using accelerated methods 
most terminalling fixed assets placed in service in  and did or should qualify for the federal or tax depreciation  except assets placed in service in louisiana and financed with go zone bonds 
a significant portion of louisiana terminalling fixed assets constructed since hurricane katrina were financed with gulf opportunity zone bonds go zone bonds 
go zone bond financed assets are depreciated  for tax purposes  primarily over to years using the straight line depreciation method 
most of the states in which the business operates do not allow the use of the federal tax depreciation calculation methods

labor costs and tank repair and cleaning costs were the largest cost increases during the majority of the increase in tank repair costs relates to repairs arising as a result of imtt s various tank inspection programs 
the increase in labor cost in as compared to was driven by wage increases and unusually high healthcare claims 
revenue and gross profit from environmental response services decreased during compared with due primarily to a lower level of spill response activity in in comparison to the level of spill response activity as a result of the bp oil spill in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased during compared to due primarily to the current absence of the costs of the spill response activity associated with the bp oil spill that occurred in

hawaii gas management believes that the presentation and analysis of contribution margin  a non gaap performance measure  is meaningful to understanding the business performance under both a utility rate structure and a non utility unregulated pricing structure 
regulation of the utility portion of hawaii gas s operations provides for the pass through of increases or decreases in feedstock costs to customers 
changes in the cost of liquefied petroleum gas  or lpg  distributed to non utility customers can be recovered in pricing  subject to competitive conditions 
contribution margin should not be considered an alternative to revenue  gross profit  operating income  or net income  determined in accordance with us gaap 
a reconciliation of contribution margin to gross profit is presented in the below table 
the business calculates contribution margin as revenue less direct costs of revenue other than production and transmission and distribution costs 
other companies may calculate contribution margin differently or may use different metrics and  therefore  the contribution margin presented for hawaii gas is not necessarily comparable with metrics of other companies

table of contents hawaii gas continued year ended december  compared with year ended december  key factors affecting operating results an increase in non utility contribution margin was driven by improvement in the volume of gas sold and margins achieved on sales generally  partially offset by higher operating costs primarily due to an increase in medical and benefits costs  overtime  electricity costs and costs related to corporate rebranding 
contribution margin and operating income the volume of gas sold in the non utility business increased by for compared to volume growth was constrained by an unplanned shutdown of a commercial customer s operation for six months during non utility contribution margin improved as the result of the volume increase  margin management and input cost reduction 
utility contribution margin was slightly higher for as compared to driven by a increase in the volume of gas sold  partially offset by higher transportation costs in january of  tesoro announced that it will close its hawaii refinery in april of tesoro has issued termination notices to hawaii gas with respect to the supply of naphtha feedstock and lpg when the refinery closes 
tesoro has indicated an intent to convert the refinery to an import  storage and distribution terminal 
if tesoro is unsuccessful or does not receive the appropriate authorizations to convert the refinery to an import  storage and distribution terminal  hawaii gas may have to construct storage capacity and supporting infrastructure sufficient to ensure its supply of feedstock 
hawaii gas has activated contingency plans related to sourcing of feedstock and expects that  subject to hpuc approval  any increases in the costs of such feedstock will be passed through to customers via the fuel adjustment mechanism and is unlikely to have a significant impact to its contribution margin 
hawaii gas also expects to secure additional supplies of lpg from a combination of imports and local production from chevron in order to make up the loss of lpg previously produced by tesoro 
hawaii gas is also moving forward with initiatives that will allow it to use lng as a back up fuel for the business sng utility distribution system 
on january   the federal energy regulatory commission ferc issued an order declining to assert jurisdiction over this activity  thus clearing the way for hawaii gas to bring containerized lng to hawaii from the us mainland in conventional intermodal cryogenic containers  subject to satisfaction of state and local regulatory requirements 
this initiative to bring lng on a small scale is expected to begin in production  transmission and distribution and selling  general and administrative expenses are composed primarily of labor related expenses and professional fees

table of contents atlantic aviation continued year ended december  compared with year ended december  key factors affecting operating results higher volume of general aviation ga fuel sold and higher weighted average ga fuel margins  and lower cash interest expense driven by reduced debt levels  partially offset by reduced de icing revenue  and lost earnings from divested locations 
revenue and gross profit the majority of the revenue and gross profit earned by atlantic aviation is generated through fueling ga aircraft at facilities located at the us airports at which atlantic aviation operates 
revenue is categorized according to who owns the fuel used to service these aircraft 
if atlantic aviation owns the fuel  it records the cost to purchase that fuel as cost of revenue fuel 
the business corresponding fuel revenue is its cost to purchase that fuel plus a margin 
the business generally pursues a strategy of maintaining  and where appropriate increasing  dollar based margins 
generally  fluctuations in the cost of fuel are passed through to the customer 
atlantic aviation also has into plane arrangements whereby it fuels aircraft with fuel owned by another party 
it collects a fee for this service that is recorded as non fuel revenue 
non fuel revenue also includes various services such as hangar rentals  de icing  landing fees  tie down fees and miscellaneous services 
the business fuel related revenue and gross profit are driven by the volume of fuel sold and dollar based margin fee per gallon 
this applies to both fuel and into plane revenue 
customers will sometimes move from one category to the other 
management believes discussing total fuel related revenue and gross profit  including both fuel sales and into plane arrangements as recorded in the non fuel revenue line and related key metrics on an aggregate basis  provides a more meaningful analysis of atlantic aviation s gross profit than a discussion of each item 
for and  the business derived and  respectively  of total gross profit from fuel and fuel related services 
the increase in gross profit in compared with was the result of an increase in volume of fuel sold and higher margins

the business did not incur a federal alternative minimum tax for liquidity and capital resources consolidated our primary cash requirements include normal operating expenses  debt service  debt principal payments  payments of dividends and capital expenditures 
our primary source of cash is operating activities  although we may borrow against existing credit facilities for growth capital expenditures  issue additional llc interests or sell assets to generate cash 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources consolidated continued we believe that our operating businesses will have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet future requirements  including servicing long term debt obligations and making distributions to mic 
we base our assessment of the sufficiency the liquidity and capital resources on the assumptions that our businesses and investments overall generate  and are expected to continue to generate  significant operating cash flow  the ongoing maintenance capital expenditures associated with our businesses are readily funded from their respective operating cash flow or available financing  all significant short term growth capital expenditures will be funded with cash on hand or from committed undrawn credit facilities  and we will be able to refinance  extend and or repay the principal amount of maturing long term debt on terms that can be supported by our businesses 
historically we have capitalized our businesses in large part using project finance style debt 
project finance style debt is generally limited recourse  floating rate  non amortizing bank debt with a medium term maturity of between five and seven years 
typically  we have sought to ensure that the debt at each business was non recourse to mic and that there was no cross collateralization or cross guarantees of any debt between our businesses 
more recently  given the availability of debt generally  we have also used slightly longer dated private placement debt as a component of the capital structure of our businesses 
for example  in august of  we included million of year non amortizing senior secured notes in the capital structure of hawaii gas in connection with the refinancing of its long term debt 
we may in the future consider other forms of capital  including bank  bond or hybrid debt instruments as a means of financing our businesses 
we are currently repaying the principal balance on the long term debt of our businesses in the following two circumstances atlantic aviation we are applying excess cash flow generated to repay the principal balance on its term loan facility regardless of leverage ratio as calculated under the facility  and district energy we are applying excess cash flow generated to repay the principal balance on its capital expenditure facility and  if fully repaid  its term loan facility 
at present  we have no debt at the mic holding company level 
rather  we had million in cash and cash equivalents at december  a portion of our cash may be used to accelerate the repayment of debt principal at atlantic aviation and the achievement of target leverage levels 
the repayment is expected to facilitate the refinancing of the business long term debt and the elimination of the cash sweep noted above 
the deployment of capital in this manner  if successful  is expected to increase our distributable free cash flow and may result in an increase in our quarterly cash dividend 
we may in the future consider the use of holding company level debt in circumstances where the cost of capitalizing our businesses  collectively  or the terms and covenants available could be improved as a result 
our use of debt instruments at the holding company level or otherwise depends on multiple factors including but not limited to the condition of the debt capital markets  the operating performance of our businesses and investments  the near and long term capital needs of the business  our ability to stagger debt maturities across our portfolio  and  where applicable  our express or implied debt ratings 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources consolidated continued our financing strategy is to ensure liquidity and access to capital markets  to manage our net exposure to floating interest rate volatility  and to maintain a balanced spectrum of debt maturities 
within these parameters  we seek to optimize our borrowing costs and the terms and covenants of our debt facilities

year ended december  change from to favorable unfavorable change from to favorable unfavorable in thousands cash provided by operating activities   cash provided by used in investing activities    cash used in financing activities   operating activities consolidated cash provided by operating activities comprises primarily the cash from operations of the businesses we own  as described in each of the business discussions below 
the cash flow from our consolidated business operations is partially offset by expenses paid by the holding company  including base management and performance fees to the extent paid in cash  professional fees  cost associated with being a public company 
the increase in consolidated cash provided by operating activities for compared with was primarily due to cash distributions received in from imtt classified as cash from operating activities compared with no distributions received during improved operating performance  timing of fuel purchases and lower cash interest paid on reduced debt levels and interest rate swap break fees at atlantic aviation  and improved operating performance in the non utility business at hawaii gas  partially offset by interest rate swap breakage fees of million paid at hawaii gas in relation to the refinance of the business long term debt facilities  and increase in litigation costs primarily from the imtt arbitration and related matters incurred at the holding company level and professional fees incurred in the acquisition of mic solar 
the decrease in consolidated cash provided by operating activities from to was due primarily to absence of distribution from imtt in  and higher working capital requirements due to increased energy costs at atlantic aviation and hawaii gas  partially offset by improved operating performance and lower cash interest paid on the reduced term loan balance for atlantic aviation  improved operating performance at hawaii gas  and million of base management fees paid in cash during compared to the reinvestment of the base management fees by our manager in llc interests 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources consolidated continued distributions from imtt are reflected in our consolidated cash provided by operating activities only up to our cumulative share of imtt s earnings recorded since our investment in imtt 
cumulative distributions in excess of this are reflected in our consolidated cash from investing activities as a return of investment in unconsolidated business 
for  million in distributions were included in cash from operating activities compared with no distributions received from imtt during for  million in distributions were included in cash from operating activities 
we believe our operating activities overall provide a source of sustainable and stable cash flows over the long term with the opportunity for future growth due to consistent customer demand driven by the basic nature of the services provided  our strong competitive position due to factors including high initial development and construction costs  difficulty in obtaining suitable land near many of our operations for example  airports  waterfront near ports  long term concessions contracts  required government approvals  which may be difficult or time consuming to obtain  lack of cost efficient alternatives to the services we provide in the foreseeable future  and product service pricing that we expect to generally keep pace with cost changes due to factors including consistent demand  limited alternatives  contractual terms  and regulatory rate setting 
investing activities the consolidated cash provided by investing activities for compared with cash used in investing activities for was primarily due to cash distributions of million received in from imtt classified as a return of investment in unconsolidated business compared with no distributions received during  and cash used for the acquisition of two oregon fbos at atlantic aviation during  partially offset by cash used in the investment in mic solar  which was funded by contribution from noncontrolling interest and mic  larger proceeds received in for the sale of fbos at atlantic aviation compared to  and increase in capital expenditures  primarily at atlantic aviation and hawaii gas 
the increase in consolidated cash used in investing activities from to was primarily due to acquisition of two oregon fbos at atlantic aviation during the third quarter of  an increase in capital expenditures at hawaii gas  and an increase in capital expenditures at atlantic aviation due to construction costs of a new fbo at oklahoma city and fbo facility upgrades at a number of locations  partially offset by cash proceeds received in for the sale of fbos at atlantic aviation  and a decrease in investment in capital leased asset at district energy 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources consolidated continued the primary driver of cash provided by used in investing activities in our consolidated cash flows has been acquisitions of businesses in new and existing segments  and the sale of the noncontrolling stake in district energy and the sale of certain fbos at atlantic aviation 
the other main driver is capital expenditures 
maintenance capital expenditures are generally funded by cash from operating activities and growth capital expenditures are generally funded by drawing on our available credit facilities or with equity capital 
we may fund maintenance capital expenditures from credit facilities or equity capital and growth capital expenditures from operating activities from time to time 
acquisitions of businesses are generally funded on a long term basis through raising additional equity capital and or project financing style credit facilities 
in december of  the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of the tax act was signed 
the tax act provides for bonus depreciation for certain fixed assets placed in service after september  and before january   and bonus depreciation for certain fixed assets placed in service during for federal income tax purposes 
generally  states do not allow this bonus depreciation deduction in determining state taxable income 
importantly  illinois and louisiana  two states in which we have significant operations  do permit the use of bonus depreciation in calculating state taxable income 
we took into consideration the benefits of these accelerated depreciation provisions of the tax act when evaluating its maintenance and growth capital expenditure plans for and in january of  the american taxpayer relief act of the tax act was signed 
the act extends the period over which the bonus depreciation provided for in the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization act of applies to include we will take the bonus depreciation provision into consideration when evaluating its maintenance and growth capital expenditure plans for financing activities the increase in consolidated cash used in financing activities for compared with was primarily due to increased dividends paid to our shareholders during  higher debt repayments at atlantic aviation during  mandatory debt repayments commencing the fourth quarter of at district energy  decreased in proceeds from the drawdown of long term debt and borrowings on line of credit facilities at atlantic aviation during  and debt financing costs paid  primarily for the refinancing of hawaii gas debt facilities in  partially offset by contribution from noncontrolling interest for mic solar 
the decrease in consolidated cash used in financing activities from to was primarily due to lower net debt repayments at atlantic aviation and no debt repayments at hawaii gas during  and proceeds from long term debt in at hawaii gas and atlantic aviation and borrowings on line of credit facilities at atlantic aviation  partially offset by dividends paid to our shareholders during  and an increase in distributions paid to noncontrolling interest in district energy 
the primary drivers of cash provided by used in financing activities are payment of dividends to our shareholders  equity offerings  debt financing of acquisitions and capital expenditures  the subsequent refinancing of our businesses and the repayment of the outstanding principal balance on maturing debt and principal payments on capital leases 
see below for further description of the cash flows related to our businesses 

table of contents imtt the following analysis represents of the cash flows of imtt  rather than just the composition of cash flows that are included in our consolidated cash flows 
we believe this is the most appropriate and meaningful approach to discussion of the historical cash flow trends of imtt 
we account for our ownership of this business using the equity method

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and judgments and uncertainties  and potentially could result in materially different results under different conditions 
our critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed below 
these estimates and policies are consistent with the estimates and accounting policies followed by the businesses we own 
business combinations our acquisitions of businesses that we control are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions are based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition  with the remainder  if any  recorded as goodwill 
the fair values are determined by our management  taking into consideration information supplied by the management of acquired entities and other relevant information 
such information includes valuations supplied by independent appraisal experts for significant business combinations 
the valuations are generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value 
the determination of fair values require significant judgment both by management and outside experts engaged to assist in this process 
goodwill  intangible assets and property  plant and equipment significant assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of hawaii gas  district energy and atlantic aviation include contract rights  customer relationships  non compete agreements  trademarks  property and equipment and goodwill 
trademarks are generally considered to be indefinite life intangibles 
trademarks and goodwill are not amortized in most circumstances 
it may be appropriate to amortize some trademarks 
however  for unamortized intangible assets  we are required to perform annual impairment reviews and more frequently in certain circumstances 
during  we adopted asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment  which permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more 
table of contents likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two step goodwill impairment test  as discussed below 
if an entity concludes it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  it need not perform the two step impairment test 
if an entity concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  it needs to perform the two step impairment test 
this requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values  which included the allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of a reporting unit s implied fair value of goodwill requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared with its corresponding carrying value 
hawaii gas  district energy and atlantic aviation are separate reporting units for purposes of this analysis 
the impairment test for trademarks  which are not amortized  requires the determination of the fair value of such assets 
if the fair value of the trademarks are less than their carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
we cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and or intangible assets 
such events include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on our customer base  or material negative change in relationship with significant customers 
property and equipment is initially stated at cost 
depreciation on property and equipment is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the property and equipment after consideration of historical results and anticipated results based on our current plans 
our estimated useful lives represent the period the asset remains in service assuming normal routine maintenance 
we review the estimated useful lives assigned to property and equipment when our business experience suggests that they do not properly reflect the consumption of economic benefits embodied in the property and equipment nor result in the appropriate matching of cost against revenue 
factors that lead to such a conclusion may include physical observation of asset usage  examination of realized gains and losses on asset disposals and consideration of market trends such as technological obsolescence or change in market demand 
significant intangibles  including contract rights  customer relationships  non compete agreements and technology are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the intangible asset after consideration of historical results and anticipated results based on our current plans 
with respect to contract rights in our atlantic aviation business  we take into consideration the history of contract right renewals in determining our assessment of useful life and the corresponding amortization period 
we perform impairment reviews of property and equipment and intangibles subject to amortization  when events or circumstances indicate that assets are less than their carrying amount and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
in this circumstance  the impairment charge is determined based upon the amount by which the net book value of the assets exceeds their fair market value 
any impairment is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
the implied fair value of reporting units and fair value of property and equipment and intangible assets is determined by our management and is generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value 
we use outside valuation experts when management considers that it is appropriate to do so 
we test for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets when there is an indicator of impairment 
impairments of goodwill  property  equipment  land and leasehold improvements and intangible assets during relating to atlantic aviation  are discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations in part ii  item in addition  see note  property  equipment  land and leasehold improvements  and note  intangible assets  in our consolidated financial statements in financial statements and supplementary data in part ii  item  of this form k for financial information and further discussions 

table of contents revenue recognition hawaii gas recognizes revenue when the services are provided 
sales of gas to customers are billed on a monthly cycle basis 
most revenue is based upon consumption  however  certain revenue is based upon a flat rate 
district energy recognizes revenue from cooling capacity and consumption at the time of performance of service 
cash received from customers for services to be provided in the future are recorded as unearned revenue and recognized over the expected services period on a straight line basis 
fuel revenue from atlantic aviation is recorded when fuel is provided or when services are rendered 
atlantic aviation also records hangar rental fees  which are recognized during the month for which service is provided 
hedging we have in place variable rate debt 
management believes that it is prudent to limit the variability of a portion of its interest payments 
to meet this objective  the company enters into interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from interest rate risk on a majority of its debt with a variable rate component 
as of february  for atlantic aviation and effective april  for our other businesses  we elected to discontinue hedge accounting 
from the dates that hedge accounting was discontinued  all movements in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded directly through earnings 
as a result of the discontinuance of hedge accounting  we will reclassify into earnings net derivative losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss over the remaining life of the existing interest rate swaps 
our derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value of interest rate swaps and cap are recorded directly through earnings 
we measure derivative instruments at fair value using the income approach  which discounts the future net cash settlements expected under the derivative contracts to a present value 
see note  derivative instruments and hedging activities  in our consolidated financial statements in financial statements and supplementary data in part ii  item  of this form k for financial information and further discussions 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method of accounting 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment

see critical accounting policies and estimates hedging for a discussion of the related accounting 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to the borrowings of our businesses 
our current policy is to enter into derivative financial instruments to fix variable rate interest payments covering a portion of the interest rate risk associated with the borrowings of our businesses  subject to the requirements of our lenders 
as of december   we had billion of current and long term debt for our consolidated continuing operations  million of which was economically hedged with interest rate contracts and million of which was unhedged 
imtt at december   imtt had two issues of new jersey economic development authority tax exempt revenue bonds outstanding with a total balance of million  where the interest rate is reset daily by tender 
a increase in interest rates on this tax exempt debt would result in a  increase in interest cost per year and a corresponding decrease would result in a  decrease in interest cost per year 
at december   imtt had outstanding million in gulf opportunity zone bonds go zone bonds to fund qualified project costs at its st 
rose  gretna and geismar storage facilities 
a increase in interest rates on the outstanding go zone bonds would result in a million increase in interest cost per year and a corresponding decrease would result in a million decrease in interest cost per year 
imtt s exposure to interest rate changes through the go zone bonds has been partially hedged until june through the use of an interest rate swap  which has a notional value of million 
as the interest rate swap is fixed against of the day libor rate and not the tax exempt tender rate  it does not result in a perfect hedge for short term rates on tax exempt debt  although it will largely offset any additional interest rate expense incurred as a result of increases in interest rates 
if interest rates decrease  the fair market value of the interest rate swap will also decrease 
a relative decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair market value of the interest rate swap of  and a corresponding relative increase would result in a  increase in the fair market value 
at december   imtt had million outstanding under its usd revolving credit facility 
a increase in interest rates on this debt would result in a m increase in interest cost per year and a corresponding decrease would result in a million decrease in interest cost per year 
imtt s exposure to interest rate changes on its us revolving credit facility has been partially hedged against day libor from october through march through the use of an interest rate swap  which has a notional value of million as of december  if interest rates decrease  the fair market value of the interest rate swap will also decrease 
a relative decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair market value of the interest rate swap of  and a corresponding relative increase would result in a  increase in the fair market value 
on december   imtt had million outstanding under its canadian revolving credit facility 
a increase in interest rates on this debt would result in an  increase in interest cost per year and a corresponding decrease would result in a  decrease in interest cost per year 
hawaii gas on august   the company completed the refinancing of hawaii gas s long term debt facilities 
the new senior financing arrangement for hawaii gas comprises of million of year  non amortizing senior secured notes at the operating company level and a million  year  non amortizing senior secured term loan agreement at the holding company level 
the senior secured notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 
the interest rate of the senior secured term loan agreement floats at libor and the floating rate has effectively been fixed for four years at using an interest rate swap 
the fixed rate on the senior secured notes and interest rate swap will offset any interest rate increases or decreases  resulting in stable interest rates of for the operating company and for the holding company 

table of contents district energy district energy has a million floating rate term loan facility maturing in a increase in the interest rate on the million district energy debt would result in a million increase in the interest cost per year 
a corresponding decrease would result in a million decrease in interest cost per year 
district energy s exposure to interest rate changes through the term loan facility has been fully hedged to maturity through the use of interest rate swaps 
these hedging arrangements will offset any additional interest rate expense incurred as a result of increases in interest rates 
however  if interest rates decrease  the value of district energy s hedge instruments will also decrease 
a relative decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair market value of the hedge instruments of approximately  a corresponding relative increase would result in an approximately  increase in the fair market value 
district energy also has a capital expenditure loan facility 
in accordance with the terms of its loan agreement  district energy will be applying of its excess cash flow generated during the third quarter of and thereafter to repay its debt facilities through the loan maturity in september subsequent to the principal repayments applied in  the capital expenditure facility had a million balance at december  a increase in the interest rate on district energy s capital expenditure loan facility would result in a  increase in interest cost per year 
a corresponding decrease would result in a  decrease in annual interest cost 
atlantic aviation on december   the outstanding balance of the floating rate senior debt for atlantic aviation was million 
a increase in the interest rate on atlantic aviation s debt would result in a million increase in the interest cost per year 
a corresponding decrease would result in a million decrease in interest cost per year 
at december   atlantic aviation held million of floating rate interest exposure 
in order to limit atlantic aviation exposure to potential increases in libor  the business entered into an interest rate cap for an upfront cost of  this floating rate hedge will effectively cap three month us libor on the notional amount of million from october  through maturity
