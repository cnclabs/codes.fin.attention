item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary we are a denver based exploration and production company focused on the extraction of oil and associated liquids rich natural gas in the united states 
our predecessors were founded in and we went public in december our shares of common stock are listed for trading on the nyse under the symbol bcei 
despite the uncertainty surrounding the global economy and continued volatility in commodity prices  we believe our portfolio positions us well moving forward 
our operations are focused in the wattenberg field in the dj basin of colorado and the cotton valley sands of southern arkansas 
the low risk  oily and stable production profile of our arkansas assets provides a strong cash flow base from which to develop the niobrara and codell formations in colorado 
our corporate strategy is to create shareholder value by increasing production in our current assets  while opportunistically seeking strategic acquisitions in other high return basins across the united states where we can apply our core competencies of horizontal drilling and fracture stimulation 
we maintain a high working interest in our properties and operate all of our proved reserves

outlook for we continue to monitor the outlook for the global economy and numerous critical factors including the united states federal budget deficit and long term fiscal situation  the european debt crisis  and their potential impacts on global economic growth and commodity prices 
because the global economic outlook and commodity price environment are uncertain  we have planned a flexible capital spending program 
we estimate our total capital expenditures for to be million  allocated approximately to the wattenberg field and to southern arkansas 
actual capital expenditures are subject to a number of factors  including economic conditions and commodity prices  and the company may reduce or augment the budget as appropriate 
this capital investment is expected to produce average sales volumes of  to  boe d  while maintaining a strong oil and liquids profile

we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements

method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties oil and natural gas exploration and development activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method 
under this method  all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized at cost when incurred  pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves 
if an exploratory well does not find proved reserves  the costs of drilling the well are charged to expense 
the costs of development wells are capitalized whether productive or nonproductive 
all capitalized well costs and other associated costs and leasehold costs of proved properties are amortized on a unit of production basis over the remaining life of proved developed reserves and proved reserves  respectively 
costs of retired  sold or abandoned properties that constitute a part of an amortization base partial field are charged or credited  net of proceeds  to accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization unless doing so significantly affects the unit of production amortization rate for an entire field  in which case a gain or loss is recognized currently 
gains or losses from the disposal of properties are recognized currently 
expenditures for maintenance  repairs and minor renewals necessary to maintain properties in operating condition are expensed as incurred 
major betterments  replacements and renewals are capitalized to the appropriate property and equipment accounts 
estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs for oil and natural gas properties are capitalized  net of salvage  at their estimated net present value and amortized on a unit of production basis over the remaining life of the related proved developed reserves 
unproved properties consist of costs incurred to acquire unproved leases  or lease acquisition costs 
unproved lease acquisition costs are capitalized until the leases expire or when we specifically identify leases that will revert to the lessor  at which time we expense the associated unproved lease acquisition costs 
the expensing of the unproved lease acquisition costs is recorded as impairment expense in the statement of operations in our consolidated financial statements 
lease acquisition costs 
table of contents related to successful exploratory drilling are reclassified to proved properties and depleted on a unit of production basis 
for sales of entire working interests in unproved properties  gain or loss is recognized to the extent of the difference between the proceeds received and the net carrying value of the property 
proceeds from sales of partial interests in unproved properties are accounted for as a recovery of costs unless the proceeds exceed the entire cost of the property 
oil and natural gas reserve quantities and standardized measure our independent engineers and technical staff prepare our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and associated future net revenues 
while the sec has recently adopted rules which allow us to disclose proved  probable and possible reserves  we have elected to disclose only proved reserves in this annual report on form k 
the sec revised rules define proved reserves as the quantities of oil and gas  which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire  unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain  regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation 
the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time 
our independent engineers and technical staff must make a number of subjective assumptions based on their professional judgment in developing reserve estimates 
reserve estimates are updated annually and consider recent production levels and other technical information about each field 
oil and natural gas reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be precisely measured 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
periodic revisions to the estimated reserves and future cash flows may be necessary as a result of a number of factors  including reservoir performance  new drilling  oil and natural gas prices  cost changes  technological advances  new geological or geophysical data  or other economic factors 
accordingly  reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
we cannot predict the amounts or timing of future reserve revisions 
if such revisions are significant  they could significantly affect future amortization of capitalized costs and result in impairment of assets that may be material 
revenue recognition revenue from our interests in producing wells is recognized when the product is delivered  at which time the customer has taken title and assumed the risks and rewards of ownership  and collectability is reasonably assured 
substantially all of our production is sold to purchasers under short term less than month contracts at market based prices 
the sales prices for oil and natural gas are adjusted for transportation and other related deductions 
these deductions are based on contractual or historical data and do not require significant judgment 
subsequently  these revenue deductions are adjusted to reflect actual charges based on third party documents 
since there is a ready market for oil and natural gas  we sell the majority of production soon after it is produced at various locations 
as a result  we maintain a minimum amount of product inventory in storage 
impairment of proved properties we review our proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value may have occurred 

table of contents we estimate the expected undiscounted future cash flows of our oil and natural gas properties and compare such undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and natural gas properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  we will adjust the carrying amount of the oil and natural gas properties to fair value 
the factors used to determine fair value are subject to our judgment and expertise and include  but are not limited to  recent sales prices of comparable properties  the present value of future cash flows  net of estimated operating and development costs using estimates of proved reserves  future commodity pricing  future production estimates  anticipated capital expenditures  and various discount rates commensurate with the risk and current market conditions associated with realizing the expected cash flows projected 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these factors  we cannot predict when or if future impairment charges for proved properties will be recorded 
impairment of unproved properties we assess our unproved properties periodically for impairment on a property by property basis based on remaining lease terms  drilling results or future plans to develop acreage and record impairment expense for any decline in value 
we have historically recognized impairment expense for unproved properties at the time when the lease term has expired or sooner if  in management judgment  the unproved properties have lost some or all of their carrying value 
we consider the following factors in our assessment of the impairment of unproved properties the remaining amount of unexpired term under our leases  our ability to actively manage and prioritize our capital expenditures to drill leases and to make payments to extend leases that may be closer to expiration  our ability to exchange lease positions with other companies that allow for higher concentrations of ownership and development  our ability to convey partial mineral ownership to other companies in exchange for their drilling of leases  and our evaluation of the continuing successful results from the application of completion technology in the niobrara formation by us or by other operators in areas adjacent to or near our unproved properties 
the assessment of unproved properties to determine any possible impairment requires significant judgment 
asset retirement obligations we record the fair value of a liability for a legal obligation to retire an asset in the period in which the liability is incurred with the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
for oil and gas properties  this is the period in which the well is drilled or acquired 
the asset retirement obligation aro for oil and gas properties represents the estimated amount we will incur to plug  abandon and remediate the properties at the end of their productive lives  in accordance with applicable state laws 
the liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated on the unit of production method 
the accretion expense is recorded as a component of depreciation  depletion and amortization in our consolidated statement of operations 
we determine the aro by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to the liability 
estimating the future aro requires management to make estimates and judgments regarding timing  existence of a liability  as well as what constitutes adequate restoration 
inherent in the fair 
table of contents value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate costs  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the fair value of the existing aro liability  a corresponding adjustment is made to the related asset 
derivatives we record all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at their estimated fair value 
we have not designated any derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes and we do not enter into such instruments for speculative trading purposes 
derivative instruments are adjusted to fair value every accounting period 
realized gains and realized losses from the settlement of commodity derivative instruments and unrealized gains and unrealized losses from valuation changes in the remaining unsettled commodity derivative instruments are reported under other income expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
stock based compensation restricted stock awards 
we recognize compensation expense for all restricted stock awards made to employees and directors 
stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
the fair value of restricted stock grants is based on the value of our common stock on the date of grant 
assumptions regarding forfeiture rates are subject to change 
any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized 
stock based compensation expense recorded for restricted stock awards is included in general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statement of operations 
income taxes our provision for taxes includes both federal and state taxes 
we record our federal income taxes in accordance with accounting for income taxes under gaap which results in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized 
we apply significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and estimating our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could differ significantly from our estimates  which could impact our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we also account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with gaap by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires that we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being 
table of contents realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
we did not have any uncertain tax positions as of the year ended december  recent accounting pronouncements goodwill 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  intangibles goodwill and other when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts asu 
asu requires step two of the goodwill impairment test to be performed when the carrying value of a reporting unit is zero or negative  if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
the requirements of this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this new guidance did not have an impact on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
business combinations 
in december  the fasb issued asu  business combinations disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations asu 
asu clarifies that when presenting comparative pro forma financial statements in conjunction with business combination disclosures  revenue and earnings of the combined entity should be presented as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period 
in addition  the update requires a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments included in pro forma revenue and earnings that are directly attributable to the business combination 
this update is effective prospectively for business combinations that occur on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period after december  as asu relates to disclosure requirements  there was no impact on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
inflation inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the periods ended december   and although the impact of inflation has been insignificant in recent years  it is still a factor in the united states economy and we tend to experience inflationary pressure on the cost of oilfield services and equipment as increasing oil and gas prices increase drilling activity in our areas of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements currently  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
oil and natural gas prices 
our financial condition  results of operations and capital resources are highly dependent upon the prevailing market prices of oil and natural gas 
these commodity prices are subject to wide fluctuations and market uncertainties due to a variety of factors that are beyond our control 
factors influencing oil and natural gas prices include the level of global demand for oil  the global supply of oil and natural gas  the establishment of and compliance with production quotas by oil exporting countries  weather conditions which determine the demand for natural gas  the price and availability of alternative fuels and overall economic conditions 
it is impossible to predict future oil and natural gas prices with any degree of certainty 
sustained weakness in oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  and may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas reserves that we can produce economically 
any reduction in our oil and natural gas reserves  including reductions due to price fluctuations  can have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain capital for our exploration and development activities 
similarly  any improvements in oil and 
table of contents natural gas prices can have a favorable impact on our financial condition  results of operations and capital resources 
if oil prices decline by per bbl  then our pv as of december  would have been lower by approximately million 
our primary commodity risk management objective is to reduce volatility in our cash flows 
management makes recommendations on hedging that are approved by the board of directors before implementation 
we enter into hedges for oil and natural gas using nymex futures or over the counter derivative financial instruments with only certain well capitalized counterparties which have been approved by our board of directors 
the use of financial instruments may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances when sales volumes are less than expected requiring market purchases to meet commitments  or our counterparties fail to purchase the contracted quantities of natural gas or otherwise fail to perform 
to the extent that we engage in hedging activities  we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of favorable price changes in the physical market 
however  we are similarly insulated against decreases in such prices 
presently  all of our hedging arrangements are concentrated with five counterparties  four of which are lenders under our credit facility 
if these counterparties fail to perform their obligations  we may suffer financial loss or be prevented from realizing the benefits of favorable price changes in the physical market 
the result of oil market prices exceeding our swap prices or collar ceilings requires us to make payment for the settlement of our hedge derivatives  if owed by us  generally up to three business days before we receive market price cash payments from our customers 
this could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows for the period between hedge settlement and payment for revenues earned 
the following table provides a summary of derivative contracts as of december  settlement period derivative instrument total notional amount bbl mmbtu average floor price average ceiling price fair market value of asset liability oil collar   swap   collar   swap   gas swap   interest rates 
at february   we had million outstanding under our credit facility  which is subject to floating market rates of interest 
borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at a fluctuating rate that is tied to an adjusted base rate or libor  at our option 
any increases in these interest rates can have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow 
based on borrowings outstanding at february   a basis point change in interest rates would change our annualized interest expense by approximately million 
counterparty and customer credit risk 
in connection with our hedging activity  we have exposure to financial institutions in the form of derivative transactions 
four lenders under our credit facility are currently four of the five counterparties on our derivative instruments currently in place and have investment grade credit ratings 
we expect that any future derivative transactions we enter into will be with these or other lenders under our credit facility that will carry an investment grade credit rating 
we are also subject to credit risk due to concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with certain significant customers 
see item business principal customers for further detail about our 
table of contents significant customers 
the inability or failure of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results 
we review the credit rating  payment history and financial resources of our customers  but we do not require our customers to post collateral 
marketability of our production 
the marketability of our production from the mid continent and rocky mountain regions depends in part upon the availability  proximity and capacity of third party refineries  natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities 
we deliver crude oil and natural gas produced from these areas through trucking services and pipelines that we do not own 
the lack of availability or capacity on these systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shut in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties 
a portion of our production may also be interrupted  or shut in  from time to time for numerous other reasons  including as a result of accidents  field labor issues or strikes  or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions 
if a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time  it could adversely affect our cash flow 
currently  there are no natural gas pipeline systems that service wells in the north park basin  which is prospective for the niobrara shale 
in addition  we are not aware of any plans to construct a facility necessary to process natural gas produced from this basin 
if neither we nor a third party constructs the required pipeline system and processing facility  we may not be able to fully develop our resources in the north park basin
