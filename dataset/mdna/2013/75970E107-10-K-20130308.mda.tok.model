item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  under the heading risk management credit risk and allowance for loan losses 
we have omitted a discussion of lease financing  as such financing comprised approximately of our portfolio at december  commercial  financial and agricultural loans 
commercial  financial and agricultural loans referred to as commercial loans  which accounted for approximately of our total loans at december   are customarily granted to established local business customers in our market area on a fully collateralized basis to meet their credit needs 
many of these loans have terms allowing the loan to be extended for periods of between one and five years 
loans are usually structured either to fully amortize over the term of the loan or to balloon after the third year or fifth year of the loan  typically with an amortization period not to exceed years 
the terms and loan structure are dependent on the collateral and strength of the borrower 
the loan to value ratios range from to  depending on the type of collateral 
commercial lending generally involves different risks from those associated with commercial real estate lending or construction lending 
although commercial loans may be collateralized by equipment or other business assets  the repayment of these types of loans depends primarily on the creditworthiness and projected cash flow of the borrower and any guarantors 
thus  the general business conditions of the local economy and the local business borrower s ability to sell its products and services  thereby generating sufficient operating revenue to repay us under the agreed upon terms and conditions  are the chief considerations when assessing the risk of a commercial loan 
the liquidation of collateral is considered a secondary source of repayment because equipment and other business assets may  among other things  be obsolete or of limited resale value 
to manage these risks  the bank s policy is to secure its commercial loans with both the assets of the borrowing business and any other additional collateral and guarantees that may be available 
in addition  we actively monitor certain financial measures of the borrower  including advance rate  cash flow  collateral value and other appropriate credit factors 
we use commercial loan credit scoring models for smaller level commercial loans 

table of contents real estate construction 
our real estate construction loans construction loans represented approximately of our total loans at december  our construction loan portfolio consists of loans for the construction of single family residential properties  multi family properties and commercial projects 
maturities for construction loans generally range from to months for residential property and from to months for non residential and multi family properties 
construction lending entails significant additional risks compared to residential real estate or commercial real estate lending 
a significant additional risk is that loan funds are advanced upon the security of the property under construction  which is of uncertain value prior to the completion of construction 
thus  it is more difficult to evaluate accurately the total loan funds required to complete a project and to calculate related loan to value ratios 
to minimize the risks associated with construction lending  we limit loan to value ratios to of when completed appraised values for owner occupied and investor owned residential or commercial properties 
real estate family mortgage 
we are active in the real estate family mortgage area referred to as residential real estate loans  with approximately of our total loans at december   being residential real estate loans 
we offer both first and second mortgages on residential real estate 
loans secured by residential real estate in which the property is the principal residence of the borrower are referred to as primary family mortgages 
loans secured by residential real estate in which the property is rented to tenants or is not the principal residence of the borrower are referred to as rental investment family mortgages 
we also offer loans for the preparation of residential real property prior to construction referred to in this annual report as residential land development loans 
in addition  we offer home equity lines of credit and term loans secured by first and second mortgages on the residences of borrowers for purchases  refinances  home improvements  education and other personal expenditures 
both fixed and variable rate loans are offered with competitive terms and fees 
originations of residential real estate loans are generated through either retail efforts in our branches or wholesale marketing  which involves obtaining mortgage referrals from third party mortgage brokers 
we attempt to minimize the risk associated with residential real estate loans by strictly scrutinizing the financial condition of the borrower  typically  we also limit the maximum loan to value ratio 
we retain loans for our portfolio when the bank has sufficient liquidity to fund the needs of established customers and when rates are favorable to retain the loans 
we also originate residential real estate loans with the intention of selling them in the secondary market to third party private investors or directly to government sponsored agencies 
these loans are collateralized by one to four family residential real estate 
when these loans are sold  we either release or retain the related servicing rights  depending on a number of factors including the pricing of such loans in the secondary market  fluctuations in interest rates that would impact the profitability of the loans  as well as other market related conditions 
residential real estate originations to be sold are sold either on a best efforts basis or under a mandatory delivery sales agreement 
under a best efforts sales agreement  residential real estate originations are locked in at a contractual rate with third party private investors or directly with government sponsored agencies  and we are obligated to sell the mortgages to such investors only if the mortgages are closed and funded 
the risk we assume is conditioned upon loan underwriting and market conditions in the national mortgage market 
under a mandatory delivery sales agreement  the company commits to deliver a certain principal amount of mortgage loans to an investor at a specified price and delivery date 
penalties are paid to the investor if we fail to satisfy the contract 
the company does not actively market or originate subprime mortgage loans 
we also offer home equity loans or lines of credit as an option to borrowers who elect to utilize the accumulated equity in their homes by borrowing money through either a first or second lien home equity loan or line of credit 
we limit our exposure to second lien home equity loans or lines of credit  which inherently carry a higher risk of loss upon default  by limiting these types of loans to borrowers with high credit scores 

table of contents real estate commercial mortgage 
our real estate commercial mortgage loans commercial real estate loans represented approximately of our total loans at december  we offer loans in which the owner develops a property with the intention of locating its business there 
these loans are referred to as owner occupied commercial real estate loans 
because payments on these loans are often dependent on the successful development  operation and management of the properties  repayment of these loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy as a whole  in addition to the borrower s ability to generate sufficient operating revenue to repay us 
if our estimate of value proves to be inaccurate  we may not be able to obtain full repayment on the loan in the event of default and foreclosure 
in most instances  these loans are secured by the underlying real estate of the business and other non real estate collateral  such as equipment or other assets used in the course of business 
in addition to owner occupied commercial real estate loans  we offer loans in which the owner develops a property where the source of repayment of the loan will come from the sale or lease of the developed property  for example  retail shopping centers  hotels  storage facilities  nursing homes  etc 
these loans are referred to as non owner occupied commercial real estate loans 
we also offer commercial real estate loans to developers of commercial properties for purposes of site acquisition and preparation and other development prior to actual construction referred to in this annual report as commercial land development loans 
we seek to minimize risks relating to all commercial real estate loans by limiting the maximum loan to value ratio and strictly scrutinizing the financial condition of the borrower  the quality of the collateral and the management of the property securing the loan 
we also actively monitor such financial measures as advance rate  cash flow  collateral value and other appropriate credit factors 
we generally obtain loan guarantees from financially capable parties to the transaction based on a review of the guarantor s financial statements 
installment loans to individuals 
installment loans to individuals or consumer loans  which represented approximately of our total loans at december   are granted to individuals for the purchase of personal goods 
these loans are generally granted for periods ranging between one and six years at fixed rates of interest from to basis points above the prime interest rate quoted in the wall street journal 
loss or decline of income by the borrower due to unplanned occurrences represents the primary risk of default to us 
in the event of default  a shortfall in the value of the collateral may pose a loss to us in this loan category 
before granting a consumer loan  we assess the applicant s credit history and ability to meet existing and proposed debt obligations 
although the applicant s creditworthiness is the primary consideration  the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral  if any  to the proposed loan amount 
we obtain a lien against the collateral securing the loan and hold title until the loan is repaid in full 
as the general economic environment in the united states and the markets in which we operate began to decline in late  management responded by implementing a strategy to diversify the company s loan portfolio by specifically reducing the concentration of construction and land development loans both residential and commercial 
to accomplish this  management applied more stringent levels of underwriting on new originations of such loans and required principal reductions of these loans at time of renewal 
the construction loan portfolio was further reduced as such loans were refinanced into permanent financing arrangements due to the completion of the construction phase of underlying projects and thus reclassified to commercial or residential real estate loans 
the company will continue this strategy to reduce the concentration of construction and land development loans in the portfolio 
at december   and  construction and land development loans represented  and  respectively  of the total loan portfolio 
deposit services 
we offer a broad range of deposit services and products to our consumer and commercial clients

operations of insurance renasant insurance is a full service insurance agency offering all lines of commercial and personal insurance through major carriers 
at december   renasant insurance contributed total revenue of million  or  of the company s total gross revenues and operated three offices in central and northern mississippi 
competition community banks vigorous competition exists in all major product and geographic areas in which we conduct banking business 
we compete through our bank for available loans and deposits with state  regional and national banks in all of our service areas  as well as savings and loan associations  credit unions  finance companies  mortgage companies  insurance companies  brokerage firms and investment companies 
all of these numerous institutions compete in the delivery of services and products through availability  quality and pricing  and many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do  including higher total assets and capitalization  greater access to capital markets and a broader offering of financial services 
for  we maintained approximately of the market share deposit base in our entire mississippi area  approximately in our entire tennessee area  approximately in our entire alabama area and approximately in our entire georgia area 
certain markets in which we operate have demographics which we believe indicate the possibility of future growth at higher rates than other markets in which we operate 
the following table shows our deposit share in those markets as of june  which is the latest date that such information is available market available deposits in billions deposit share mississippi tupelo desoto county oxford columbus starkville tennessee memphis nashville maryville alabama birmingham decatur huntsville madison montgomery tuscaloosa georgia alpharetta roswell canton woodstock cartersville cumming source fdic  as of june  
table of contents wealth management our wealth management segment competes with other banks  brokerage firms  financial advisers and trust companies  which provide one or more of the services and products that we offer 
our wealth management operations compete on the basis of available product lines  rates and fees  as well as reputation and professional expertise 
no particular company or group of companies dominates this industry 
insurance we encounter strong competition in the markets in which we conduct insurance operations 
through our insurance subsidiary  we compete with independent insurance agencies and agencies affiliated with other banks and or other insurance carriers 
all of these agencies compete in the delivery of personal and commercial product lines 
there is no dominant insurance agency in our markets 
supervision and regulation community banks under the current regulatory environment  nearly every facet of our banking operations is regulated pursuant to various state and federal banking laws  rules and regulations 
the primary focus of these laws and regulations is the protection of depositors and the maintenance of the safety and soundness of the banking system as a whole and the insurance funds of the fdic 
while the following summary addresses the regulatory environment in which we operate  it is not intended to be a fully inclusive discussion of the statutes and regulations affecting our operations 
discussions in this section focus only on certain provisions of such statutes and regulations and do not purport to be comprehensive 
such discussions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the relevant statutes and regulations 
in addition  the regulatory environment in which we operate is likely to change over the coming years as a result of the enactment into law of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act in july  the dodd frank act has significantly altered the current bank regulatory structure and affected the lending  investment  trading  and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies  and more changes are likely 
the dodd frank act includes the following provisions that  among other things centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency  the consumer financial protection bureau  responsible for implementing  examining and  for large financial institutions  enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws 
banks with billion or less in assets will be examined by their applicable bank regulators 
weaken the federal preemption available for national banks and give state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws 
broaden the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated assets less tangible capital  eliminate the ceiling on the size of the deposit insurance fund the dif and increase the floor of the size of the dif 
make permanent the  limit for federal deposit insurance and increase the cash limit of securities investor protection corporation protection from  to  repeal the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits  thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts 
authorize the fdic to assess the cost of examinations 
direct the federal reserve to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives  regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not 
expand limitations on insider transactions through the strengthening of loan restrictions to insiders and the expansion of the types of transactions subject to the various limits  including derivative transactions  repurchase agreements  reverse repurchase agreements and securities lending or borrowing transactions 
restrict certain asset sales to and from an insider to an insured depository institution unless the transaction is on market terms and  if the amount involved in the transaction represents more than of the capital of the insured depository institution  the transaction is approved in advance by the disinterested directors 

table of contents some of these provisions may have the consequence of increasing the company s expenses  decreasing its revenues and changing the activities in which the company engages 
the environment in which banking organizations will now operate  including legislative and regulatory changes affecting capital  liquidity  supervision  permissible activities  corporate governance and compensation  changes in fiscal policy and steps to eliminate government support for banking organizations  may have long term effects on the profitability of banking organizations that cannot now be foreseen 
provisions in the legislation that revoke the tier capital treatment of trust preferred securities do not apply to the company s trust preferred securities because of the company s size 
the specific impact of the dodd frank act on the company s financial performance and the markets in which its operates will depend on the manner in which the relevant agencies develop and implement the required rules and the reaction of market participants to these regulatory developments 
many aspects of the dodd frank act are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years  making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on the company  its customers or the financial industry in general 
on june   the office of the comptroller of the currency  the board of governors of the federal reserve system  and the federal deposit insurance corporation issued a joint press release announcing three notices of proposed rulemaking the basel iii nprs in connection with revised international regulatory framework for banks by the basel committee on banking supervision  including a proposal  among other things  to implement a new common equity tier minimum capital requirement and a higher minimum tier capital requirement 
as proposed  the new common equity tier minimum capital requirement and the higher minimum tier capital requirement would apply to us bank holding companies with more than million in assets 
an assessment of the basel iii nprs on the company and renasant bank is not provided in this annual report because such proposals are subject to change through the comment and review process 
therefore  the effects of the basel iii nprs on the company and renasant bank cannot be meaningfully assessed 
the final rules resulting from the basel iii nprs could impact the company s and renasant bank s capital ratios 
we elected not to participate in the us treasury department s capital purchase program  which is part of the federal government s troubled asset relief program the tarp 
thus  we will not be subject to any of the regulations enacted with respect to such program 
however  first m f corporation issued cdci preferred stock 
if that stock is not redeemed or repurchased prior to the closing  then they will be exchanged for shares of our preferred stock with the same terms and conditions 
this would result in our being subject to the tarp regulations 
we currently anticipate that these shares of cdci preferred stock will be redeemed or purchased 
we are a bank holding company within the meaning of the bank holding company act of  as amended the act  and are registered as such with the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve 
we are required to file with the federal reserve an annual report and such other information as the federal reserve may require 
the federal reserve may also make examinations of us and the bank pursuant to the act 
the federal reserve has the authority which to date it has not exercised to regulate provisions of certain types of our debt 
the act requires a bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve before acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares of any bank that is not already majority owned by such bank holding company 
the act further provides that the federal reserve shall not approve any acquisition  merger or consolidation which would result in a monopoly or which would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking 
the federal reserve will also not approve any transaction in which the effect of the transaction might be to lessen competition substantially or in any manner amount to a restraint on trade  unless the anti competitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the benefits to the public interest resulting from the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served 

table of contents the act also prohibits a bank holding company  with certain exceptions  from itself engaging in or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than of the voting shares of any company engaged in non banking activities 
the principal exception to this prohibition is for a bank holding company engaging in or acquiring shares of a company whose activities are found by the federal reserve to be so closely related to banking or managing banks as to be a proper incident thereto 
in making determinations whether activities are closely related to banking or managing banks  the federal reserve is required to consider whether the performance of such activities by a bank holding company or its subsidiaries can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public  such as greater convenience  increased competition or gains in efficiency of resources and whether such public benefits outweigh the risks of possible adverse effects  such as decreased or unfair competition  conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices 
the company and the bank are subject to certain restrictions imposed by the federal reserve act and the federal deposit insurance act on any extensions of credit to the company or the bank  on investments in the stock or other securities of the company or the bank and on taking such stock or other securities as collateral for loans of any borrower 
on november   the gramm leach bliley financial services modernization act of the financial services modernization act was signed into law 
the financial services modernization act eliminates the barriers erected by the glass steagall act and amends the act  among other statutes 
further  it allows for the affiliation of banking  securities and insurance activities in new financial services organizations 
a dominant theme of the financial services modernization act is functional regulation of financial services  with the primary regulator of the company or its subsidiaries being the agency which traditionally regulates the activity in which the company or its subsidiaries wish to engage 
for example  the securities and exchange commission sec will regulate bank holding company securities transactions  and the various banking regulators will oversee banking activities 
the principal provisions of the financial services modernization act permit the company  so long as it meets the standards for a well managed and well capitalized institution and has at least a satisfactory community reinvestment act performance rating  to engage in any activity that is financial in nature  including security and insurance underwriting  investment banking and merchant banking investing in commercial and industrial companies 
the company  if it satisfies the above criteria  can file a declaration of its status as a financial holding company fhc with the federal reserve and thereafter engage directly or through nonbank subsidiaries in the expanded range of activities which the financial services modernization act identifies as financial in nature 
further  the company  if it elects fhc status  will be able to pursue additional activities which are incidental or complementary in nature to a financial activity or which the federal reserve subsequently determines to be financial in nature 
we have not elected to become an fhc 
the dodd frank act removed the restrictions on interstate branching contained in the reigle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of national and state chartered banks are now authorized to establish de novo branches in other states if  under the laws of the state in which the branch is to be located  a bank chartered by that state would be permitted to establish the branch 
accordingly  banks will be able to enter new markets more freely 
bank holding companies are allowed to acquire savings associations under the financial institutions reform  recovery and enforcement act of firrea 
deposit insurance premiums for banks and savings associations were increased as a result of firrea  and losses incurred by the fdic in connection with the default or assistance of troubled federally insured financial institutions are required to be reimbursed by other federally insured financial institutions 
the company s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders is substantially dependent on the ability of renasant bank to transfer funds to the company in the form of dividends  loans and advances 
under mississippi law  a mississippi bank may not pay dividends unless its earned surplus is in excess of three times capital stock 
a mississippi bank with earned surplus in excess of three times capital stock may pay a dividend  subject to the approval of the mississippi department of banking and consumer finance 
in addition  the fdic must approve any payment of dividends by the bank 
accordingly  the approval of these supervisory authorities is required prior to renasant bank paying dividends to the company 
federal reserve regulations also limit the amount renasant bank may loan to the company unless such loans are collateralized by specific obligations 

table of contents the bank s deposits are insured by the fdic  and the bank is subject to examination and review by that regulatory authority 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia provides for increased funding for the dif through risk based assessments and expands the regulatory powers of federal banking agencies to permit prompt corrective actions to resolve problems of insured depository institutions 
the community reinvestment act of requires the assessment by the appropriate regulatory authority of a financial institution s record in meeting the credit needs of its local communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods  consistent with the safe and sound operation of those institutions 
these factors are also considered in evaluating mergers  acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility 
the usa patriot act of contains the international money laundering abatement and financial anti terrorism act of the imlafa 
the imlafa substantially broadens existing anti money laundering legislation and the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the united states  imposes new compliance and due diligence obligations  creates new crimes and penalties  compels the production of documents located both inside and outside the united states  including those of foreign institutions that have a correspondent relationship in the united states  and clarifies the safe harbor from civil liability to customers 
the us treasury department has issued a number of regulations implementing the usa patriot act that apply certain of its requirements to financial institutions such as our bank 
the regulations impose new obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies  procedures and controls to detect  prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing 
the imlafa requires all financial institutions  as defined  to establish anti money laundering compliance and due diligence programs 
such programs must include  among other things  adequate policies  the designation of a compliance officer  employee training programs and an independent audit function to review and test the program 
the company believes that it has complied with these requirements 
wealth management and insurance our wealth management and insurance operations are subject to licensing requirements and regulation under the laws of the united states and the state of mississippi 
the laws and regulations are primarily for the benefit of clients 
in all jurisdictions  the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment by regulatory authorities 
generally  such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant  renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations 
licenses may be denied or revoked for various reasons  including the violation of such regulations  conviction of crimes and the like 
other possible sanctions which may be imposed for violation of regulations include suspension of individual employees  limitations on engaging in a particular business for a specified period of time  censures and fines 
monetary policy and economic controls we and the bank are affected by the policies of regulatory authorities  including the federal reserve 
an important function of the federal reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit in order to stabilize prices 
among the instruments of monetary policy used by the federal reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in us government securities  changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits 
these instruments are used in varying degrees to influence overall growth of bank loans  investments and deposits and may also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits 
the monetary policies of the federal reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to do so in the future 
in view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the various money markets  as well as the effect of actions by monetary and fiscal authorities including the federal reserve  the effect on our  and the bank s  future business and earnings cannot be predicted with accuracy 
sources and availability of funds the funds essential to our  and our bank s  business consist primarily of funds derived from customer deposits  federal funds purchased  securities sold under repurchase agreements  federal home loan bank advances and borrowings from correspondent banks by the bank 
the availability of such funds is primarily dependent upon the economic policies of the federal government  the economy in general and the general credit market for loans

table of contents item a 
risk factors in addition to the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this form k and the exhibits hereto  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business 
the risks disclosed below  either alone or in combination  could materially adversely affect the business  financial condition or results of operations of the company 
additional risks not presently known to us  or that we currently deem immaterial  may also adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
risks related to our business and industry our business may be adversely affected by current economic conditions in general and specifically in our mississippi  tennessee  alabama and georgia markets 
over the past few years  the united states economy and the global economy have experienced a severe economic downturn 
only in the past year has it appeared that united states and global economic conditions are beginning to improve  and even then the improvement has been sluggish 
notwithstanding these signs of improvement  business activity across a wide range of industries and regions remains greatly reduced  and local governments and many businesses are in serious difficulty due to the lack of consumer spending and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets 
unemployment has also remained elevated above historical levels 
the markets in which we operate have not been immune from the effects of this economic downturn 
since mid  the financial services industry and the securities markets generally were materially and adversely affected by significant declines in the values of nearly all asset classes and by a significant lack of liquidity in the credit markets 
this was initially triggered by declines in home prices and the values of subprime mortgages 
the global markets have since been characterized by substantially increased volatility and an overall loss of investor confidence  initially in financial institutions  but now in companies in virtually all other industries and in the broader markets 
declining asset values  defaults on mortgages and consumer loans  and the lack of market and investor confidence  as well as other factors  have all combined to cause rating agencies to lower credit ratings  and to otherwise increase the cost and decrease the availability of liquidity  despite very significant and lasting declines in federal reserve borrowing rates and other government actions 
as a result of this market volatility  many banks and other institutions have suffered significant losses and have become reluctant to lend  even on a secured basis  due to the increased risk of default and the impact of declining asset values on the value of collateral 
this has significantly weakened the strength and liquidity of many financial institutions worldwide  resulting in the failure or near failure of many institutions 
in addition  the economic conditions in the states of mississippi  tennessee  alabama and georgia and the specific local markets in which we operate will particularly affect our results of operations and our financial condition 
due to our limited market areas  the local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans  the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources 
our financial performance generally  and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans  is highly dependent upon the business conditions in the markets where we operate  in the united states as a whole and abroad 
these conditions include liquidity in the credit markets  short term and long term interest rates  inflation  deflated money supply  political issues  legislative and regulatory changes  fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets  broad trends in industry and finance and the strength of the us economy and the local economies in which we operate  all of which are beyond our control 
we anticipate that the business environment in our markets and the united states as a whole will continue its slow recovery over the foreseeable future  and there remains a possibility of further deterioration 
in either case  the credit quality of our loans and the value of loan collateral  as well as our results of operations and financial condition  are likely to be materially and adversely affected 
we believe that the impact of the economic downturn in the united states heightens all of the risks described in the remainder of this item a 

table of contents we are subject to lending risk 
there are inherent risks associated with our lending activities 
these risks include  among other things  the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets where we operate as well as those across the united states 
increases in interest rates and or weakening economic conditions could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing these loans 
for the reasons explained below  if current trends in the housing and real estate markets continue  we may experience higher than normal delinquencies and credit losses 
as of december   approximately of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial  construction and commercial real estate loans 
these types of loans are generally viewed as having more risk to our financial condition than other types of loans due primarily to the large amounts loaned to individual borrowers 
because the loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial  construction and commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances  the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans 
an increase in nonperforming loans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans  an increase in the provision for possible loan losses and an increase in loan charge offs  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our commercial  construction and commercial real estate loan portfolios are discussed in more detail under the heading operations operations of community banks in item  business 
we have a high concentration of loans secured by real estate 
at december   approximately of our loan portfolio had real estate as a primary or secondary component of the collateral securing the loan 
the real estate provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of a default by the borrower 
over the past few years  united states real estate  particularly georgia real estate  has experienced a severe decline in value  with the real estate market and property values just recently showing small signs of stabilization 
although real estate values in our alabama  mississippi and tennessee markets have not declined as dramatically as in georgia and other areas of the united states  any such adverse change in our markets could significantly impair the value of the particular collateral securing our loans and our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure for an amount necessary to satisfy the borrower s obligations to us 
furthermore  in a declining real estate market  we often will need to further increase our allowance for loan losses to address the deterioration in the value of the real estate securing our loans 
this was the case from to any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we have a concentration of credit exposure in commercial real estate 
at december   we had approximately billion in commercial real estate loans  representing approximately of our loans outstanding on that date 
in addition to the general risks associated with our lending activities described above  including the effects of declines in real estate values  commercial real estate loans are subject to additional risks 
commercial real estate loans depend on cash flows from the property to service the debt 
cash flows  either in the form of rental income or the proceeds from sales of commercial real estate  may be affected significantly by general economic conditions 
a downturn in the local economy generally or in occupancy rates where the property is located could increase the likelihood of default 
in addition  in light of the current downturn in united states real estate markets generally  banking regulators are giving commercial real estate lending greater scrutiny and  in some instances  have required banks with higher levels of commercial real estate loans to implement improved underwriting  internal controls  risk management policies and portfolio stress testing  as well as possibly higher levels of allowances for loan losses and capital levels as a result of commercial real estate lending growth and exposure 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information furnished by others about customers and counterparties 
in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions  we often rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties  including financial statements  credit reports  other financial information and appraisals of the value of collateral 
we may also rely on representations of those customers  counterparties or other third parties  such as independent auditors  as to the accuracy and completeness of that information 
reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements  credit reports  other financial information or appraisals could have a material adverse effect on our business and  in turn  our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our allowance for possible loan losses may be insufficient  and we may be required to further increase our provision for loan losses 
although we try to maintain diversification within our loan portfolio in order to minimize the effect of economic conditions within a particular industry  management also maintains an allowance for loan losses  which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense  to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the entire loan portfolio 
the appropriate level of the allowance is based on management s ongoing analysis of the loan portfolio and represents an amount that management deems adequate to provide for inherent losses  including collateral impairment 
among other considerations in establishing the allowance for loan losses  management considers economic conditions reflected within industry segments  the unemployment rate in our markets  loan segmentation and historical losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio 
the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires management to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends  all of which may undergo material changes 
changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers  new information regarding existing loans  identification of additional problem loans and other factors  both within and outside of our control  may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses 
the economic downturn in the united states has made it more difficult to estimate with precision the extent to which credit risks and future trends need to be addressed through a provision to our allowance for loan losses 
if current weak economic conditions continue  particularly in the construction and real estate markets  we expect that we will continue to experience higher than normal delinquencies and credit losses 
as a result  we may be required to make further increases in our provision for loan losses and to charge off additional loans in the future  which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge offs  based on judgments different than those of management 
in addition  if charge offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses  we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses 
any increases in the allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and  possibly  capital and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
a discussion of the policies and procedures related to management s process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses is set forth under the heading risk management credit risk and allowance for loan losses in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to interest rate risk 
our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest earned on assets  such as loans and securities  and the cost of interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowed funds 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and  in particular  the federal reserve 
currently  to help combat the effects of the economic downturn in the united states  the federal reserve has indicated that it is likely to maintain a low interest rate policy with respect to its federal funds target rate for the foreseeable future 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings  but such changes could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits  which could reduce the amount of fee income generated  and the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities 

table of contents our financial results are constantly exposed to market risk 
market risk refers to the probability of variations in net interest income or the fair value of our assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates  among other things 
the primary source of market risk to us is the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income 
we are subject to market risk because of the following factors assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times 
for example  if assets reprice more slowly than liabilities and interest rates are generally rising  earnings may initially decline 
assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by different amounts 
for example  when interest rates are generally rising  we may increase rates charged on loans by an amount that is less than the general increase in market interest rates because of intense pricing competition 
also  risk occurs when assets and liabilities have similar repricing frequencies but are tied to different market interest rate indices that may not move in tandem 
short term and long term market interest rates may change by different amounts  ie  the shape of the yield curve may affect new loan yields and funding costs differently 
the remaining maturity of various assets and liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change 
for example  if long term mortgage interest rates decline sharply  mortgage backed securities held in our securities portfolio may prepay significantly earlier than anticipated  which could reduce portfolio income 
if prepayment rates increase  we would be required to amortize net premiums into income over a shorter period of time  thereby reducing the corresponding asset yield and net interest income 
interest rates may have an indirect impact on loan demand  credit losses  loan origination volume  the value of financial assets and financial liabilities  gains and losses on sales of securities and loans  the value of mortgage servicing rights and other sources of earnings 
although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce market risk on the results of our operations  these strategies are based on assumptions that may be incorrect 
any substantial  unexpected  prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
volatility in interest rates may also result in disintermediation  which is the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments  such as us government and agency securities and other investment vehicles  including mutual funds  which generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements 
disintermediation could also result in material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations 
a discussion of our policies and procedures used to identify  assess and manage certain interest rate risk is set forth under the heading risk management interest rate risk in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
liquidity needs could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we rely on dividends from the bank as our primary source of funds 
the primary source of the bank s funds are customer deposits and loan repayments 
while scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds  they are subject to the ability of borrowers to repay the loans 
the ability of borrowers to repay loans can be adversely affected by a number of factors  including changes in economic conditions  adverse trends or events affecting business industry groups  reductions in real estate values or markets  business closings or lay offs  inclement weather  natural disasters and international instability 
many of these conditions arose during the recent economic downturn 
additionally  deposit levels may be affected by a number of factors  including rates paid by competitors  general interest rate levels  returns available to customers on alternative investments and general economic conditions 
accordingly  we may be required from time to time to rely on secondary sources of liquidity to meet withdrawal demands or otherwise fund operations or to support growth 
such sources include federal home loan bank advances and federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks 
while we believe that these sources are currently adequate  there can be no assurance they will be sufficient to meet future liquidity demands 
if the aforementioned sources of liquidity are not adequate for our needs  we may attempt to raise additional capital in the capital markets 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on conditions in such markets at that time  which are outside our control  and on our financial performance 
accordingly  we cannot assure you of our ability to raise additional capital in this manner 

table of contents if we are unable to meet our liquidity needs  we may be required to slow or discontinue loan growth  capital expenditures or other investments or liquidate assets 
our business strategy includes the continuation of growth plans  and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively 
we have grown our business outside our mississippi footprint through the acquisition of entire financial institutions and through de novo branching 
since the second half of  we have opened seven de novo branches  acquired specified assets and the operations of  and assumed specified liabilities of  crescent and american trust in two fdic assisted transactions and acquired the rbc bank usa trust division 
also  on february th   we announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which we will acquire by merger first m f corporation first m f and its wholly owned subsidiary  merchants and farmers bank 
we intend to continue pursuing a growth strategy for our business through de novo branching and to evaluate attractive acquisition opportunities that are presented to us  whether via negotiated or fdic assisted transactions 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies when expanding their franchise  including the following all of which are generally applicable to an analysis of the risks relating to our pending acquisition of first m f management of growth 
we may be unable to successfully maintain loan quality in the context of significant loan growth  maintain adequate management personnel and systems to oversee such growth  maintain adequate internal audit  loan review and compliance functions  and implement additional policies  procedures and operating systems required to support such growth 
operating results 
there is no assurance that existing offices or future offices will maintain or achieve deposit levels  loan balances or other operating results necessary to avoid losses or produce profits 
our growth and de novo branching strategy necessarily entails growth in overhead expenses as we routinely add new offices and staff 
our historical results may not be indicative of future results or results that may be achieved as we continue to increase the number and concentration of our branch offices 
should any new location be unprofitable or marginally profitable  or should any existing location experience a decline in profitability or incur losses  the adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition could be more significant than would be the case for a larger company 
development of offices 
there are considerable costs involved in opening branches  and new branches generally do not generate sufficient revenues to offset their costs until they have been in operation for at least a year or more 
accordingly  our de novo branches can be expected to negatively impact our earnings for some period of time until the branches reach certain economies of scale 
our expenses could be further increased if we encounter delays in opening any of our de novo branches 
we may be unable to accomplish future branch expansion plans due to a lack of available satisfactory sites  difficulties in acquiring such sites  increased expenses or loss of potential sites due to complexities associated with zoning and permitting processes  higher than anticipated merger and acquisition costs or other factors 
finally  we have no assurance our de novo branches or branches that we may acquire will be successful even after they have been established or acquired  as the case may be 
expansion into new markets 
much of our recent growth has been focused in the highly competitive metropolitan areas of memphis and nashville  tennessee and birmingham and huntsville  alabama as well as north georgia and east tennessee markets 
the customer demographics and financial services offerings in these markets are unlike those found in the mississippi markets that we have historically served 
in these growth markets we face competition from a wide array of financial institutions  including much larger  well established financial institutions 
regulatory and economic factors 
our growth and expansion plans may be adversely affected by a number of regulatory and economic developments or other events  including regulatory changes enacted in response to the current economic downturn which are discussed in more detail below or regulatory conditions imposed on us in connection with the approval of our pending acquisition 
failure to obtain required regulatory approvals  changes in laws and regulations or other regulatory developments and changes in prevailing economic conditions or other unanticipated events may prevent or adversely affect our continued growth and expansion 
such factors may cause us to alter our growth and expansion plans or slow or halt the growth and expansion process  which may prevent us from entering certain target markets or allow competitors to gain or retain market share in our existing or expected markets 

table of contents failure to successfully address these issues could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations  and could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy 
also  if our growth occurs more slowly than anticipated or declines  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our recent and pending acquisitions 
the success of our acquisitions of specified assets and the operations of  and our assumption of specified liabilities of  crescent and american trust from the fdic  our acquisition of the trust division of rbc bank usa and  if completed  our acquisition of first m f will depend on  among other things  our ability to realize anticipated cost savings and to integrate the acquired assets and operations in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt our existing customer relationships or result in decreased revenues resulting from any loss of customers 
if we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives  the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 
additionally  we will make fair value estimates of certain assets and liabilities in recording each acquisition 
actual values of these assets and liabilities could differ from our estimates  which could result in our not achieving the anticipated benefits of the particular acquisition 
we cannot assure you that our acquisitions will have positive results  including results relating to correctly assessing the asset quality of the assets acquired  the total cost of integration  including management attention and resources  the time required to complete the integration successfully  the amount of longer term cost savings  being able to profitably deploy funds acquired in the transaction  retaining the existing client relationships  or the overall performance of the combined business 
our future growth and profitability depends  in part  on our ability to successfully manage the combined operations 
integration of an acquired business can be complex and costly  and we may encounter a number of difficulties  such as deposit attrition  customer loss and revenue loss  the loss of key employees  the disruption of our operations and business  our inability to maintain and increase competitive presence  possible inconsistencies in standards  control procedures and policies  and or unexpected problems with costs  operations  personnel  technology and credit 
additionally  general market and economic conditions or governmental actions affecting the financial industry generally may inhibit our successful integration of the operations acquired 
notwithstanding our loss share arrangements with the fdic with respect to some of the assets that we acquired  we may continue to experience increased credit costs or need to take additional markdowns and make additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses on the crescent and american trust loans acquired whether on account of the effects of the economic downturn in the united states or otherwise 
similar circumstances could arise following our completion of our acquisition of first m f 
any of these actions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the future 
there is no assurance that as our integration efforts continue in connection with either of the fdic assisted transactions or the integration of first m f  other unanticipated costs  including the diversion of personnel  or losses will not be incurred 
in addition  the attention and effort devoted to the integration of an acquired business may divert management s attention from other important issues and could harm our business 

table of contents we may experience difficulty in managing the loan portfolios acquired from crescent and american trust within the limits of the loss protection provided by the fdic 
in connection with the acquisitions of crescent s and american trust s respective assets and operations and the assumption of their liabilities  the bank entered into loss share arrangements with the fdic that covered approximately million of acquired assets in the aggregate 
under each loss share arrangement  the fdic is obligated to reimburse the bank for of all eligible losses with respect to covered assets  beginning with the first dollar of loss incurred 
the bank has a corresponding obligation to reimburse the fdic for of eligible recoveries with respect to covered assets 
in addition  each purchase and assumption agreement with the fdic provides that after the th anniversary of the acquisition  the fdic has a right to recover a portion of its shared loss reimbursements if losses on the covered assets are less than million for crescent or million for american trust 
the loss share agreements applicable to single family residential mortgage loans provide for fdic loss share and bank reimbursement to the fdic to run for ten years  and the loss share agreement applicable to commercial and other assets provides for fdic loss share and bank reimbursement to the fdic to run for five years  with additional recovery sharing for three years thereafter 
the fdic has the right to refuse or delay loss share payments for loan losses if we do not adhere to the terms of the loss share agreements 
also  any charge offs that we experience after the terms of the loss share agreements have ended would not be recoverable from the fdic 
certain provisions of the loss share agreements entered into with the fdic may have anti takeover effects and could limit our ability to engage in certain strategic transactions that our board of directors believes would be in the best interests of shareholders 
the fdic s agreement to bear of qualifying losses on single family residential loans for ten years and commercial loans for five years is a significant asset of the company and a feature of the crescent and american trust acquisitions without which we would not have entered into either transaction 
our agreements with the fdic require that we receive fdic consent  which may be withheld by the fdic in its sole discretion  prior to us or our shareholders engaging in certain transactions 
if any such transaction is completed without prior fdic consent  the fdic would have the right to discontinue either or both of the loss share arrangements 
among other things  prior fdic consent is required for a merger or consolidation of the company with or into another company if our shareholders will own less than of the combined company  a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the bank  or a sale of shares by one or more of our shareholders that will effect a change in control of the bank  as determined by the fdic with reference to the standards set forth in the change in bank control act generally  the acquisition of between and of our voting securities where the presumption of control is not rebutted  or the acquisition of more than of our voting securities 
it is unlikely that we would have any ability to control or prevent such a sale by our shareholders 
if we or any shareholder desired to enter into any such transaction  there can be no assurances that the fdic would grant its consent in a timely manner  without conditions  or at all 
if one of these transactions were to occur without prior fdic consent and the fdic withdrew its loss share protection  there could be a material adverse impact on the company 
we may engage in additional fdic assisted transactions 
we intend to continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire failed banks through fdic assisted transactions 
if we acquire the assets and liabilities of additional failed banks in fdic assisted transactions  we will be subject to many of the same risks as those discussed above with respect to the crescent and american trust transactions  in addition to the risks we would face in acquiring another bank in a negotiated transaction 
in addition  because fdic assisted transactions are structured in a manner that do not allow us the time and access to information normally associated with preparing for and evaluating a negotiated acquisition  we may face additional risks in fdic assisted transactions  including additional strain on management resources  management of problem loans  problems related to integration of personnel and operating systems and impact to our capital resources requiring us to raise additional capital 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with fdic assisted transactions 
our inability to overcome these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we may face risks with respect to future acquisitions 
when we attempt to expand our business through mergers and acquisitions including fdic assisted transactions  we seek targets that are culturally similar to us  have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through economies of scale or expanded services or  in the case of fdic assisted transactions  on account of the loss share arrangements with the fdic associated with such transactions 
we believe that our pending acquisition of first m f meets these criteria 
in addition to the general risks associated with our growth plans and the particular risks associated with fdic assisted transactions both of which are highlighted above  in general acquiring other banks  businesses or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions  including  among other things the time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisition and merger targets  inaccuracies in the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit  operations  management and market risks with respect to the target institution  the time and costs of evaluating new markets  hiring experienced local management and opening new bank locations  and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion  our ability to finance an acquisition and possible dilution to our existing shareholders  the diversion of our management s attention to the negotiation of a transaction  the incurrence of an impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and adverse effects on our results of operations  entry into new markets where we lack experience  and risks associated with integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business  as discussed above in the context of the crescent and american trust transactions 
all of the foregoing matters are applicable to our pending acquisition of first m f 
we expect to continue to evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities including fdic assisted transactions that are presented to us and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions 
as a result  merger or acquisition discussions and  in some cases  negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash  debt or equity securities may occur at any time 
historically  acquisitions of non failed financial institutions involve the payment of a premium over book and market values  and  therefore  some dilution of our book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction which may be the case as a result of the first m f acquisition 
failure to realize the expected revenue increases  cost savings  increases in geographic or product presence and or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
competition in our industry is intense and may adversely affect our profitability 
we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors  many of which are larger and have substantially greater resources than we have  including higher total assets and capitalization  greater access to capital markets and a broader offering of financial services 
such competitors primarily include national  regional and community banks within the various markets in which we operate 
we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions  including savings and loans  credit unions  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  factoring companies and other financial intermediaries 
the information under the heading competition in item  business  provides more information regarding the competitive conditions in our growth markets 
our industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation 
the economic downturn in the united states has already resulted in the consolidation of a number of financial institutions  in addition to acquisitions of failed institutions 
we expect additional consolidation to occur 
banks  securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company  which can offer virtually any type of financial service  including banking  securities underwriting  insurance both agency and underwriting and merchant banking 
also  as highlighted by our discussion of the dodd frank act  legislative and regulatory changes on both the federal and state level may materially affect competitive conditions in our industry 
finally  technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks  such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems 
many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures 

table of contents our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including  among other things the ability to develop  maintain and build upon long term customer relationships based on top quality service  high ethical standards and safe and sound assets  the ability to expand our market position  the scope  relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands  the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors  customer satisfaction with our level of service  and industry and general economic trends 
failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position  which could adversely affect our growth and profitability  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions 
entities within the financial services industry are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty and other relationships 
we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and from time to time execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including commercial banks  brokers and dealers  investment banks and other institutional clients 
many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client 
in addition  our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral we hold cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit due to us 
any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to extensive government regulation  and such regulation could limit or restrict our activities and adversely affect our earnings 
we and the bank are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision 
banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds  federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole 
these regulations affect our lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy and growth  among other things 
furthermore  as discussed below  the dodd frank act has already  and likely in the future will  result in significant changes to the regulations governing banks and other financial institutions  and other changes to such regulations have been proposed 
we believe it is likely that some of these proposed changes will be enacted  although it is impossible to predict the ultimate substance of these changes or their likely effect on our activities or profitability 
changes to statutes  regulations or regulatory policies  including changes in interpretation or implementation of the foregoing  could affect us and or the bank in substantial and unpredictable ways 
such changes could subject us to additional costs  limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements  we and the bank must meet guidelines that include quantitative measures of assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items  subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
if we fail to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements  our financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
our failure to maintain the status of well capitalized under our regulatory framework could affect the confidence of our customers in us  thus compromising our competitive position 
in addition  failure to maintain the status of well capitalized under our regulatory framework or well managed under regulatory examination procedures could compromise our status as a bank holding company and related eligibility for a streamlined review process for merger or acquisition proposals and would result in higher deposit insurance premiums assessed by the fdic 
we are also subject to laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure in addition to the dodd frank act  including the sarbanes oxley act of and sec regulations 
these laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases  and as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies  which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  our efforts to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  increased expenses and a diversion of management time and attention 

table of contents failure to comply with laws  regulations or policies could also result in sanctions by regulatory agencies and or civil money penalties  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations  there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur
