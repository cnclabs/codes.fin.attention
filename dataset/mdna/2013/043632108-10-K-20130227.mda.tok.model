item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents expand our network of dealers we plan to continue to grow account purchases from our dealer network by targeting dealers that can benefit from our dealer program services and that can generate high quality subscribers for us 
we believe we are an attractive partner for dealers for the following reasons we provide our dealers with a full range of services designed to assist them in all aspects of their business  including sales leads  sales training  technical training  comprehensive on line account access  detailed weekly account summaries  sales support materials and discounts on security system hardware purchased through our strategic alliances with security system manufacturers  individual dealers retain local name recognition and responsibility for day to day sales and installation efforts  thereby supporting the entrepreneurial culture at the dealer level and allowing us to capitalize on the considerable local market knowledge  goodwill and name recognition of our dealers  and we are a reliable purchaser of accounts at competitive rates 
for a description of the risks associated with the foregoing strategies  and with the company s business in general  see risk factors section beginning on page industry  competition the security alarm industry is highly competitive and fragmented  and competitors include four other major firms with nationwide coverage and numerous smaller providers with regional or local coverage 
the four other security alarm companies with coverage across the us are as follows the adt corporation adt  protection one  inc  stanley security solutions  a subsidiary of stanley black and decker  and vivint  inc the security alarm industry has remained highly competitive and fragmented over time without any material change to market concentration 
competition in the security alarm industry is based primarily on reputation for quality of service  market visibility  services offered  price and the ability to identify subscriber accounts 
we believe we compete effectively with other national  regional and local alarm monitoring companies due to our reputation for reliable monitoring  customer and technical services  the quality of services  and our low cost structure 
the dynamics of the security alarm industry often favor larger alarm monitoring companies with a nationwide focus that have greater capital and benefit from economies of scale in technology  advertising and other expenditures 
some of these larger alarm monitoring companies have also adopted  in whole or in part  a dealer program similar to that of monitronics 
in these instances  monitronics must also compete with these programs in recruiting dealers 
we believe we compete effectively with other dealer programs due to our competitive account purchase terms and the quality of our dealer support services 
the alarm monitoring companies that compete with monitronics for alarm system dealers in this manner include security networks  llc and adt  the latter of which is significantly larger and has more capital 
seasonality monitronics operations are subject to a certain level of seasonality 
since more household moves take place during the second and third calendar quarters of each year  monitronics disconnect rate and expenses related to retaining customers are typically higher in those calendar quarters than in the first and fourth quarters 
there is also a slight seasonal effect resulting in higher new customer volume and related cash expenditures incurred in investment in new subscribers in the second and third quarters 
regulatory matters monitronics operations are subject to a variety of laws  regulations and licensing requirements of federal  state and local authorities 
in certain jurisdictions  monitronics is required to obtain licenses or permits to comply with standards governing employee selection and training and to meet certain standards in the conduct of its business 
the security industry is also subject to requirements imposed by various insurance  approval  listing and standards organizations 
depending upon the type of subscriber served  the type of security service provided and the requirements of the applicable local governmental jurisdiction  adherence to the requirements and standards of such organizations is mandatory in some instances and voluntary in others 

table of contents although local governments routinely respond to panic and smoke fire alarms  there are an increasing number of local governmental authorities that have adopted or are considering various measures aimed at reducing the number of false burglar alarms 
such measures include subjecting alarm monitoring companies to fines or penalties for false alarms  imposing fines on alarm subscribers for false alarms  imposing limitations on the number of times the police will respond to false alarms at a particular location  requiring additional verification of intrusion alarms by calling two different phone numbers prior to dispatch enhanced call verification  and requiring visual verification of an actual emergency at the premise before the police will respond to an alarm signal 
enhanced call verification has been implemented as standard policy by monitronics 
monitronics alarm monitoring business utilizes telephone lines  internet connections  cellular networks and radio frequencies to transmit alarm signals 
the cost of telephone lines  and the type of equipment which may be used in telephone line transmission  are currently regulated by both federal and state governments 
the operation and utilization of cellular and radio frequencies are regulated by the federal communications commission and state public utility commissions

risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form k  you should consider the following risk factors in evaluating our results of operations  financial condition  business and operations or an investment in our stock 
although we describe below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k the risks we consider to be the most material  there may be other unknown or unpredictable economic  business  competitive  regulatory or other factors that also could have material adverse effects on our results of operations  financial condition  business or operations in the future 
in addition  past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
if any of the events described below  individually or in combination  were to occur  our businesses  prospects  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
factors relating to our corporate history and strategy we have substantially changed the businesses in which we operate 
accordingly  it may be difficult to evaluate our performance based on our operating history 
our financial statements for periods prior to february include the financial position and results of operations of the business units formerly operated by our wholly owned subsidiary  amg 
amg was primarily engaged in the business of providing content distribution and creative services to the media and entertainment industries 
the businesses of amg were organized into two operating segments businesses that provided content management and delivery services content services  and businesses that provided creative services creative services 
the content services segment was in turn divided into three business units i the content distribution business unit content distribution  ii the media management services business unit media services and iii the systems integration business unit systems integration or si 
we completed the sales of the creative services operating segment and media services business unit which is referred to collectively as creative media and the content distribution business unit on or before february  and shut down the systems integration business unit in june the businesses of amg  accordingly  are reflected as discontinued operations in our financial statements 
we acquired our current principal operating subsidiary  monitronics  on december  hence  the results of operations of monitronics are only included in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  with respect to the stub period december  through december   and for the years ended december  and we had previously included in our current report on form k a filed december   current report on form k filed october   and current report on form k a filed march   the following the audited consolidated financial statements of monitronics for the periods july  through december  predecessor and december  through december  successor  the audited consolidated financial statements of monitronics for the fiscal years ended june   and  and for the three months ended june   the unaudited consolidated financial statements of monitronics for the three months ended september  and  an unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of september   giving effect to the acquisition of monitronics and the dispositions of the creative media and content distribution businesses  on a pro forma basis  as if such transactions had occurred on that date  and an unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the nine months ended september  and the year ended december   giving effect to the acquisition of monitronics and the dispositions of the creative media and content distribution businesses  on a pro forma basis  as if such transactions had occurred on january  however  the historical financial information of monitronics included in these reports generally reflect its results of operations  financial condition and cash flows with respect to time periods during which it was a stand alone entity  rather than part of a public company  and may not necessarily reflect what such results would have been if monitronics had been a subsidiary of our company during the periods presented 
moreover  the unaudited pro forma financial statements included in the december report do not purport to represent  and are not necessarily indicative of what our financial position or results of operations would have been had such transactions occurred on the dates indicated 

table of contents we have a history of losses and may incur losses in the future 
monitronics  our primary operating subsidiary  incurred losses in each of its last three full fiscal years 
in future periods  we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability on a consistent quarterly or annual basis 
failure to maintain profitability in future periods may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our acquisition strategy may not be successful 
one focus of our corporate strategy is to seek opportunities to grow free cash flow through strategic acquisitions  which may include leveraged acquisitions 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to consummate that strategy  and if we are not able to invest our capital in acquisitions that are accretive to free cash flow it could negatively impact the growth of our primary operating business 
our ability to consummate such acquisitions may be negatively impacted by various factors  including among other things failure to identify attractive acquisition candidates on acceptable terms  competition from other bidders  inability to raise any required financing  and antitrust or other regulatory restrictions  including any requirements that may be imposed by government agencies as a condition to any required regulatory approval 
if we engage in any acquisition  we will incur a variety of costs  and may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
our business strategy includes the future acquisition of businesses that we believe are strategically attractive and that we expect will be accretive to consolidated free cash flow 
if we undertake any acquisition  the process of operating such acquired business on a stand alone basis  or  if applicable  of integrating any acquired business with monitronics  may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures 
moreover  we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition as rapidly as expected or at all 
future acquisitions could reduce our current stockholders ownership percentage  cause us to incur debt and expose us to liabilities 
further  we may incur significant expenditures and devote substantial management time and attention in anticipation of an acquisition that is never realized 
lastly  while we intend to implement appropriate controls and procedures as we integrate any acquired companies  we may not be able to certify as to the effectiveness of these companies disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting within the time periods required by us federal securities laws and regulations 
we are a holding company and derive substantially all of our revenue and cash flow from our primary operating subsidiary  monitronics 
monitronics is a separate and independent legal entity and has no obligation to make funds available to us  whether in the form of loans  dividends or otherwise 
the ability of monitronics to pay dividends to us is subject to  among other things  compliance with covenants in its credit agreement and its high yield bond indenture  the availability of sufficient earnings and funds  and applicable state laws 
as of december   monitronics had consolidated indebtedness of  claims of creditors of monitronics have priority as to its assets over our claims and those of our creditors and shareholders 
an inability to access capital markets at attractive rates could materially increase our expenses 
although we currently have sufficient cash and investments available to meet our anticipated capital requirements for the foreseeable future  we may in the future require access to capital markets as a source of liquidity for investments and expenditures 
in any such event  there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 
if our ability to access required capital were to become significantly constrained  we could incur material borrowing costs  our financial condition could be harmed and future results of operations could be adversely affected 
we may have substantial indemnification obligations under certain inter company agreements we entered into in connection with the spin off of our company from dhc 
pursuant to our tax sharing agreement with dhc  we have agreed to be responsible for all taxes attributable to us or any of our subsidiaries  whether accruing before  on or after the spin off subject to specified exceptions 
we have also agreed to be responsible for and indemnify dhc with respect to i certain taxes attributable to dhc or any of its subsidiaries other than discovery communications  llc and ii all taxes arising as a result of the spin off subject to specified exceptions 
our indemnification obligations under the tax sharing agreement are not limited in amount or subject to any cap 
pursuant to the reorganization agreement we entered into with dhc in connection with the spin off  we assumed certain indemnification obligations designed to make our company financially responsible for substantially all non tax liabilities that may exist relating to the business of our former subsidiary  
table of contents amg  whether incurred prior to or after the spin off  as well as certain obligations of dhc 
any indemnification payments under the tax sharing agreement or the reorganization agreement could be substantial 
factors relating to our common stock it may be difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so may be beneficial to our shareholders 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company that our shareholders may consider favorable 
these provisions include the following a capital structure with multiple series of common stock a series b that entitles the holders to ten votes per share  a series a that entitles the holders to one vote per share  and a series c that  except in such limited circumstances as may be required by applicable law  entitles the holders to no voting rights  authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock  which could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt  classifying our board of directors with staggered three year terms  which may lengthen the time required to gain control of our board of directors through a proxy contest or exercise of voting rights  limiting who may call special meetings of shareholders  prohibiting shareholder action by written consent subject to certain exceptions  thereby requiring such action to be taken at a meeting of the shareholders  establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by shareholders at shareholder meetings  requiring shareholder approval by holders of at least of our voting power or the approval by at least of our board of directors with respect to certain extraordinary matters  such as a merger or consolidation of our company  a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or an amendment to our certificate of incorporation  requiring the consent of the holders of at least of the outstanding series b common stock voting as a separate class to certain share distributions and other corporate actions in which the voting power of the series b common stock would be diluted  for example by issuing shares having multiple votes per share as a dividend to holders of series a common stock  and the existence of authorized and unissued stock which would allow our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management  thereby protecting the continuity of its management  or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us 
the beneficial ownership by john c 
malone  a former director of the company  of shares of our common stock  that represent approximately of the aggregate voting power of our outstanding common stock as of january   may also discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company 
in addition  monitronics new credit facility provides that the occurrence of specified change of control events will result in an event of default thereunder  and the senior notes include a covenant that requires monitronics to make an offer to purchase all outstanding senior notes  at of par  upon the occurrence of specified change of control events  each of which could cause an acquisition of our company to be prohibitively expensive for a potential bidder 
we have adopted a shareholder rights plan in order to encourage anyone seeking to acquire our company to negotiate with our board of directors prior to attempting a takeover 
while our shareholder rights plan is designed to guard against coercive or unfair tactics to gain control of our company  the plan may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying any attempts by others to obtain control of our company in a transaction that our shareholders may find favorable 
holders of a single series of our common stock may not have any remedies if an action by our directors has an adverse effect on only that series of our common stock 
principles of delaware law and the provisions of our certificate of incorporation may protect decisions of our board of directors that have a disparate impact upon holders of any single series of our common stock 
under delaware law  the board of directors has a duty to act with due care and in the best interests of all of our shareholders  including the holders of all series of our common stock 
principles of delaware law established in cases involving differing treatment of multiple classes or series of stock provide that a board of directors owes an equal duty to all common shareholders regardless of class or series and does not have separate or additional duties to any group of shareholders 
as a result  in some circumstances  our directors may be required to make a decision that is viewed as adverse to the holders of one series of our common stock 
under the principles of delaware law and the business judgment rule  
table of contents holders may not be able to successfully challenge decisions that they believe have a disparate impact upon the holders of one series of our stock if our board of directors is disinterested and independent with respect to the action taken  is adequately informed with respect to the action taken and acts in good faith and in the honest belief that the board is acting in the best interest of all of our stockholders 
although our series b common stock trades on the otc bulletin board  there is no meaningful trading market for the stock 
our series b common stock is not widely held  with of the outstanding shares as of january  beneficially owned by john c 
malone  a former director of the company 
although it is listed on the otc bulletin board  it is sparsely traded and does not have an active trading market 
the otc bulletin board tends to be highly illiquid  in part  because there is no national quotation system by which potential investors can track the market price of shares except through information received or generated by a limited number of broker dealers that make markets in particular stocks 
there is also a greater chance of market volatility for securities that trade on the otc bulletin board as opposed to a national exchange or quotation system 
this volatility is due to a variety of factors  including a lack of readily available price quotations  lower trading volume  absence of consistent administrative supervision of bid and ask quotations  and market conditions 
each share of the series b common stock is convertible  at any time at the option of the holder  into one share of series a common stock  which is listed and traded on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol ascma 
factors relating to monitronics monitronics faces risks in acquiring and integrating new subscribers 
the acquisition of alarm monitoring agreements amas by monitronics involves a number of risks  including the risk that the purchased amas may not be profitable due to higher than expected account attrition  lower than expected revenues from the amas or  when applicable  lower than expected recoveries from dealers 
the purchase price monitronics pays a dealer for an ama is affected by the monthly recurring revenue generated by the ama  as well as several other factors  including the level of competition  monitronics prior experience with amas purchased from the dealer  the number of amas purchased  the subscriber s credit score and the type of security equipment used by the subscriber 
to the extent that the servicing costs or the attrition rates are higher than expected or the revenues from the amas or  when applicable  the recoveries from dealers are lower than expected  monitronics business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
monitronics is subject to credit risk and other risks associated with its subscribers 
substantially all of monitronics revenues are derived from the recurring monthly revenue due from subscribers under the amas 
therefore  monitronics is dependent on the ability and willingness of subscribers to pay amounts due under the amas on a monthly basis in a timely manner 
although subscribers are contractually obligated to pay amounts due under an ama and are prohibited from canceling the ama for the initial term of the ama typically between three to five years  subscribers payment obligations are unsecured  which could impair monitronics ability to collect any unpaid amounts from its subscribers 
to the extent defaults by subscribers of their obligations under the amas are greater than anticipated  monitronics business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
monitronics relies on a significant number of its subscribers remaining with it for an extended period of time 
monitronics incurs significant upfront cash costs for each new subscriber 
monitronics requires a substantial amount of time  typically exceeding the initial term of the related ama  for it to receive cash payments net of its variable cash operating costs from a particular subscriber that are sufficient to offset this upfront cost 
accordingly  monitronics long term performance is dependent on its subscribers remaining with it as subscribers for as long as possible 
this requires monitronics to minimize its rate of subscriber cancellations  or attrition 
factors that can increase cancellations include subscribers who relocate and do not reconnect  problems with service quality  competition from other alarm monitoring companies  equipment obsolescence  adverse economic conditions and the affordability of its service 
if monitronics fails to keep the subscribers for a sufficiently long period of time  attrition rates would be higher than expected and monitronics financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  monitronics may experience higher attrition rates with respect to subscribers acquired in bulk buys than subscribers acquired pursuant to monitronics authorized dealer program 
monitronics completed its largest bulk buy during the fourth quarter of  increasing its subscriber base by more than 

table of contents monitronics is subject to credit risk and other risks associated with its dealers 
under the standard alarm monitoring purchase agreement ampa that monitronics enters into with its dealers  if a subscriber terminates their service with monitronics during the first twelve months after the ama has been purchased  the dealer is typically required to elect between substituting another ama for the terminating ama or compensating monitronics in an amount based on the original purchase price of the terminating ama 
monitronics is subject to the risk that dealers will breach their obligation to provide a comparable substitute ama for a terminating ama 
although monitronics withholds specified amounts from the purchase price paid to dealers for amas holdback  which may be used to satisfy or offset these and other applicable dealer obligations under the ampa  there can be no guarantee that these amounts will be sufficient to satisfy or offset the full extent of the default by a dealer of its obligations under an ampa 
if the holdback does prove insufficient to cover dealer obligations  monitronics is also subject to the credit risk that the dealers may not have sufficient funds to compensate monitronics when substitute amas are unavailable or that any such dealer will otherwise breach its obligation to compensate monitronics for a terminating ama 
to the extent defaults by dealers of their obligations under the ampas are greater than anticipated  monitronics financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the alarm monitoring business is subject to macroeconomic factors  including prolonged downturns in the housing market  which may negatively impact monitronics results of operations and subscriber account growth 
the alarm monitoring business is dependent in part on national  regional and local economic conditions 
in particular  where disposable income available for discretionary spending is reduced such as by higher housing  energy  interest or other costs or where the actual or perceived wealth of customers has decreased because of circumstances such as lower residential real estate values  increased foreclosure rates  inflation  increased tax rates or other economic disruptions  the alarm monitoring business could experience increased attrition rates and reduced consumer demand 
although monitronics has continued to grow its business in the most recent periods of general economic downturn  no assurance can be given that it will be able to continue acquiring quality amas or that it will not experience higher attrition rates 
in addition  any deterioration in new construction and sales of existing single family homes could reduce opportunities to grow monitronics subscriber accounts from the sales of new security systems and services and the take over of existing security systems that had previously been monitored by monitronics competitors 
if the general economic downturn is prolonged or materially worsens  monitronics results of operations and subscriber account growth could be materially and adversely affected 
adverse economic conditions in states where monitronics subscribers are more heavily concentrated may negatively impact monitronics results of operations 
even as economic conditions may improve in the us as a whole  this improvement may not occur or further deterioration may occur in the regions where monitronics subscribers are more heavily concentrated such as texas  california  florida and arizona 
although monitronics has a geographically diverse subscriber base  adverse conditions in one or more states where monitronics business is more heavily concentrated could have a significant adverse effect on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
if the insurance industry were to change its practice of providing incentives to homeowners for the use of alarm monitoring services  monitronics may experience a reduction in new customer growth or an increase in its subscriber attrition rate 
it has been common practice in the insurance industry to provide a reduction in rates for policies written on homes that have monitored alarm systems 
there can be no assurance that insurance companies will continue to offer these rate reductions 
if these incentives were reduced or eliminated  new homeowners who otherwise may not feel the need for alarm monitoring services would be removed from monitronics potential customer pool  which could hinder the growth of monitronics business  and existing subscribers may choose to disconnect or not renew their service contracts  which could increase monitronics attrition rates 
in either case  monitronics results of operations and growth prospects could be adversely affected 
risks of liability from monitronics business and operations may be significant 
the nature of the services provided by monitronics potentially exposes it to greater risks of liability for employee acts or omissions or system failures than may be inherent in other businesses 
if subscribers believe that they incurred losses as a result of an action or a failure to act by monitronics  the subscribers could bring claims against monitronics  and monitronics has been subject to lawsuits of this type from time to time 
similarly  if dealers believe that they incurred losses or were denied rights under the ampas as a result of an action or a failure to act by monitronics  the dealers could bring claims against monitronics 
substantially all of monitronics amas and ampas contain provisions limiting monitronics liability to subscribers and dealers  respectively  in an attempt to reduce this risk 
however  in the event of any such litigation  no assurance can be given that these limitations will be enforced  and the costs of such litigation or the related settlements or judgments could have a material adverse effect on monitronics financial condition 
in 
table of contents addition  there can be no assurance that monitronics is adequately insured for these risks 
certain of monitronics insurance policies and the laws of some states may limit or prohibit insurance coverage for punitive or certain other types of damages or liability arising from gross negligence 
if significant uninsured damages are assessed against monitronics  the resulting liability could have a material adverse effect on monitronics financial condition or results of operations 
future litigation could result in adverse publicity for monitronics 
in the ordinary course of business  from time to time  monitronics is the subject of complaints or litigation from subscribers or inquiries from government officials  sometimes related to alleged violations of state consumer protection statutes including by monitronics dealers  negligent dealer installation and negligent service of alarm monitoring systems 
monitronics may also be subject to employee claims based on  among other things  alleged discrimination  harassment or wrongful termination claims 
in addition to diverting monitronics management resources  adverse publicity resulting from such allegations may materially and adversely affect monitronics reputation in the communities it services  regardless of whether such allegations are unfounded 
such adverse publicity could result in higher attrition rates and greater difficulty in attracting new subscribers on terms that are attractive to monitronics or at all 
a disruption to monitronics monitoring facility and its back up monitoring facility could adversely affect its business 
a disruption to both the monitoring facility and the back up monitoring facility could affect monitronics ability to provide alarm monitoring services to its subscribers 
any such disruption could occur for many reasons  including fire  natural disasters  weather  transmission interruption  malicious acts or terrorism 
monitronics main monitoring facility holds underwriters laboratories listings as protective signaling services stations and maintains certain standards of building integrity  redundant computer and communications facilities and backup power  among other safeguards 
however  no assurance can be given that both of monitronics monitoring facilities will not be impacted by a disruption  including one from a catastrophic event or natural disaster 
any such disruption  particularly one of a prolonged duration  could have a material adverse effect on monitronics business 
monitronics relies on third parties to transmit signals to its monitoring facilities 
monitronics relies on various third party telecommunications providers and signal processing centers to transmit and communicate signals to its monitoring facilities in a timely and consistent manner 
these telecommunications providers and signal processing centers could fail to transmit or communicate these signals to the monitoring facilities for many reasons  including due to disruptions from fire  natural disasters  weather  transmission interruption  malicious acts or terrorism 
the failure of one or more of these telecommunications providers or signal processing centers to transmit and communicate signals to the monitoring facilities in a timely manner could affect monitronics ability to provide alarm monitoring services to its subscribers 
there can be no assurance that third party telecommunications providers and signal processing centers will continue to transmit and communicate signals to the monitoring facilities without disruption 
any such disruption  particularly one of a prolonged duration  could have a material adverse effect on monitronics business 
see also shifts in customer choice of  or telecommunications providers support for  telecommunications services and equipment could adversely impact monitronics business and require significant capital expenditures below with respect to risks associated with changes in signal transmissions 
the alarm monitoring business is subject to technological innovation over time 
monitronics monitoring services depend upon the technology both hardware and software of security alarm systems located at subscribers premises 
monitronics may be required to implement new technology both to attract and retain subscribers  including in response to changes in land line or cellular technology or other factors  which could require significant expenditures 
in addition  the availability of any new features developed for use in our industry whether developed by monitronics or otherwise can have a significant impact on a subscriber s initial decision to choose monitronics or its competitor s products and a subscriber s decision to renew with monitronics or switch to one of its competitors 
to the extent monitronics competitors have greater capital and other resources to dedicate to responding to technological innovation over time  the products and services offered by monitronics may become less attractive to current or future subscribers thereby reducing demand for such products and services and increasing attrition over time 
those competitors that benefit from more capital being available to them may be at a particular advantage to monitronics in this respect 
if monitronics is unable to adapt in response to changing technologies  market conditions or subscriber requirements in a timely manner  monitronics may experience increased attrition rates 
monitronics also faces potential competition from improvements in self monitoring systems  which enable current or future subscribers to monitor their home environments without third party involvement  which could further increase attrition rates over time and hinder new subscriber acquisitions of new amas 

table of contents shifts in customer choice of  or telecommunications providers support for  telecommunications services and equipment could adversely impact monitronics business and require significant capital expenditures 
a significant portion of monitronics subscriber alarm systems use either a traditional  land line telecommunication service or a g cellular service to communicate alarm signals from the subscribers locations to monitronics monitoring facility 
there is a growing trend for consumers to give up their land line and exclusively use cellular and ip communication technology in their homes and businesses  and telecommunications providers may discontinue land line services in the future 
in addition  there is no guarantee that telecommunications providers will continue to support the g cellular network in the future 
the continued operation of both the landline and g cellular networks will depend on a number of factors which are outside of monitronics control 
if either the land line or g cellular network is discontinued  subscribers will need to replace certain equipment in their security system to maintain their monitoring service 
this could increase monitronics subscriber attrition rates and  to retain customers  require monitronics to subsidize the replacement of subscribers outdated systems at its own expense 
any such upgrades or implementations could require significant expenditures and also divert management s attention and other important resources away from customer service and sales efforts 
in the future  monitronics may not be able to successfully implement new technologies or adapt existing technologies to changing market demands 
if monitronics is unable to adapt timely to changing technologies  market conditions or customer preferences  monitronics business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
privacy concerns  such as consumer identity theft and security breaches  could hurt monitronics reputation and revenues 
as part of its operations  monitronics collects a large amount of private information from its subscribers  including credit card information  images and voice recordings 
if monitronics were to experience a breach of its data security  it may put private information of its subscribers at risk of exposure 
to the extent that any such exposure leads to credit card fraud or identity theft  monitronics may experience a general decline in consumer confidence in its business  which may lead to an increase in attrition rates or may make it more difficult to attract new subscribers 
if consumers become reluctant to use monitronics services because of concerns over data privacy or credit card fraud  monitronics ability to generate revenues would be impaired 
in addition  if technology upgrades or other expenditures are required to prevent security breaches of its network  boost general consumer confidence in its business  or prevent credit card fraud and identity theft  monitronics may be required to make unplanned capital expenditures or expend other resources 
any such loss of confidence in its business or additional capital expenditure requirement could have a material adverse effect on monitronics business  financial condition and results of operations 
monitronics reputation as a service provider of high quality security offerings may be adversely affected by product defects or shortfalls in customer service 
monitronics business depends on its reputation and ability to maintain good relationships with its subscribers  dealers and local regulators  among others 
monitronics reputation may be harmed either through product defects  such as the failure of one or more of its subscribers alarm systems  or shortfalls in customer service 
subscribers generally judge monitronics performance through their interactions with the staff at the monitoring centers and dealers who perform on site maintenance services 
any failure to meet subscribers expectations in such customer service areas could cause an increase in attrition rates or make it difficult to recruit new subscribers 
any harm to monitronics reputation or subscriber relationships caused by the actions of its dealers  personnel or third party service providers or any other factors could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
a loss of experienced employees could adversely affect monitronics 
the success of monitronics has been largely dependent upon the active participation of its officers and employees 
the loss of the services of key members of monitronics management for any reason may have a material adverse effect on the operations of monitronics and the ability of monitronics to maintain and grow its business 
monitronics depends on the managerial skills and expertise of its management and employees to provide customer service by  among other things  monitoring and responding to alarm signals  coordinating equipment repairs  administering billing and collections under the amas and administering and providing dealer services under the ampas 
there is no assurance that monitronics will be able to retain its current management and other experienced employees or replace them satisfactorily to the extent they leave the employ of monitronics 
the loss of any such experienced employees services and expertise could materially and adversely affect monitronics business 

table of contents the high level of competition in monitronics industry could adversely affect its business 
the security alarm monitoring industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
as of december   monitronics was one of the largest alarm monitoring companies in the us when measured by the total number of subscribers under contract 
monitronics faces competition from other alarm monitoring companies  including companies that have more capital and that may offer higher prices and more favorable terms to dealers for amas purchased or charge lower prices for monitoring services 
monitronics also faces competition from a significant number of small regional competitors that concentrate their capital and other resources in targeting local markets and form new marketing channels that may displace the existing alarm system dealer channels for acquiring amas 
further  monitronics is facing increasing competition from telecommunications and cable companies who are expanding into alarm monitoring services and bundling their existing offerings with monitored security services 
the existing access to and relationship with subscribers that these companies have could give them a substantial advantage over monitronics  especially if they are able to offer subscribers a lower price by bundling these services 
any of these forms of competition could reduce the acquisition opportunities available to monitronics  thus slowing its rate of growth  or requiring it to increase the price paid for such subscriber accounts  thus reducing its return on investment and negatively impacting its revenues and results of operations 
we may be unable to obtain additional funds to grow monitronics business 
monitronics intends to continue to pursue growth through the acquisition of subscriber accounts through its authorized dealer program  among other means 
to continue its growth strategy  monitronics intends to make additional draw downs under the revolving credit portion of the credit facility and may seek financing through new credit arrangements or the possible sale of new securities  any of which may lead to higher leverage or result in higher borrowing costs 
an inability to obtain funding through external financing sources on favorable terms or at all is likely to adversely affect monitronics ability to continue or accelerate its subscriber account acquisition activities 
monitronics has a substantial amount of indebtedness and the costs of servicing that debt may materially affect its business and ours 
monitronics has a significant amount of indebtedness 
as of december   monitronics had consolidated indebtedness of  that substantial indebtedness  combined with its other financial obligations and contractual commitments  could have important consequences to us 
for example  it could require monitronics to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations which also constitutes substantially all of our cash flow to the payment of interest and principal due under its indebtedness  which will reduce funds available to fund future subscriber account purchases  working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements  increase its vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit its flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the markets in which we operate  limit monitronics ability to obtain additional financing required to fund future subscriber account purchases  working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements  place monitronics at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of its competitors that are less leveraged  reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures  and cause any refinancing of monitronics indebtedness to be at higher interest rates and require monitronics to comply with more onerous covenants  which could further restrict our business operations 

table of contents the agreements governing monitronics various debt obligations  including its credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes  impose restrictions on its business and such restrictions could adversely affect its ability to undertake certain corporate actions 
the agreements governing monitronics indebtedness restrict its ability to  among other things incur additional indebtedness  make cash distributions to us by means of loans or cash dividends  make certain loans and investments  create liens  enter into transactions with affiliates  including our company  restrict subsidiary distributions  dissolve  merge or consolidate  make capital expenditures  transfer  sell or dispose of assets  and acquire certain types of alarm monitoring contracts 
monitronics must also comply with certain financial and non financial covenants under the credit facility 
credit facility covenants include capital expenditure limits  maximum total monitronics debt to ebitda as defined within the credit facility agreement ratios  a minimum monitronics fixed charge coverage ratio  a maximum eligible recurring monthly revenue as defined within the credit facility agreement to ebitda ratio  and a maximum attrition rate 
if monitronics cannot comply with any of these covenants  it may not be able to make additional draw downs under the revolving credit facility  which would limit monitronics ability to manage its working capital requirements 
in addition  failure to comply with the restrictions contained in the credit facility or senior notes could lead to an event of default  which could result in the acceleration of a substantial amount of indebtedness 
third party claims with respect to monitronics intellectual property  if decided against monitronics  may result in competing uses of monitronics intellectual property or require the adoption of new  non infringing intellectual property 
monitronics has received and may continue to receive notices claiming it committed intellectual property infringement  misappropriation or other intellectual property violations and third parties have claimed  and may  in the future  claim that monitronics does not own or have rights to use all intellectual property rights used in the conduct of its business 
while monitronics does not believe that any of the currently outstanding claims are material  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert future infringement claims against monitronics or claims that monitronics rights to its intellectual property are invalid or unenforceable  and monitronics cannot guarantee that these claims will be unsuccessful 
any claims involving rights to use the monitronics mark could have a material adverse effect on the alarm monitoring business if such claims were decided against monitronics and it were precluded from using or licensing the monitronics mark or others were allowed to use it 
if monitronics were required to adopt a new name  it would entail marketing costs in connection with building up recognition and goodwill in such new name 
in the event that monitronics was enjoined from using any of its other intellectual property  there would be costs associated with the replacement of such intellectual property with developed  acquired or licensed intellectual property 
there would also be costs associated with the defense and settlement of any infringement or misappropriation allegations and any damages that may be awarded 
factors relating to regulatory matters false alarm ordinances could adversely affect monitronics business and operations 
significant concern has arisen in certain municipalities about the high incidence of false alarms 
in some localities  this concern has resulted in local ordinances or policies that restrict police response to third party monitored burglar alarms 
in addition  an increasing number of local governmental authorities have considered or adopted various measures aimed at reducing the number of false alarms  including subjecting alarm monitoring companies to fines or penalties for transmitting false alarms  imposing fines on alarm monitoring services customers for false alarms  imposing limitations on the number of times the police will respond to alarms at a particular location  and requiring further verification of an alarm signal  such as visual verification or verification to two different phone numbers  before the police will respond 

table of contents enactment of these measures could adversely affect monitronics future operations and business 
for example  numerous cities or metropolitan areas have implemented verified response ordinances for residential and commercial burglar alarms 
a verified response policy means that police officers generally do not respond to an alarm until someone else eg  the resident  a neighbor or a security guard first verifies that it is valid 
some alarm monitoring companies operating in these areas hire security guards or use third party guard firms to verify an alarm 
if monitronics needs to hire security guards or use third party guard firms  it could have a material adverse effect on its business through either increased servicing costs  which could negatively affect the ability of monitronics to fund properly its ongoing operations  or increased costs to its customer  which may limit its ability to attract new customers or increase our subscriber attrition rates 
in addition  the perception that police departments will not respond to third party monitored burglar alarms  may reduce customer satisfaction with traditional monitored alarm systems  which may also result in increased attrition rates or decreased customer demand 
although monitronics has less than  subscribers in these areas  a more widespread adoption of such a policy or similar policies in other cities or municipalities could materially and adversely affect its business 
monitronics business operates in a regulated industry 
monitronics business  operations and dealers are subject to various us federal  state and local consumer protection laws  licensing regulation and other laws and regulations  and  to a lesser extent  similar canadian laws and regulations 
while there are no us federal laws that directly regulate the security alarm monitoring industry  the advertising and sales practices of monitronics and its dealer network are subject to regulation by the us federal trade commission the ftc in addition to state consumer protection laws 
the ftc and the federal communications commission have issued regulations that place restrictions on  among other things  unsolicited automated telephone calls to residential and wireless telephone subscribers by means of automatic telephone dialing systems and the use of prerecorded or artificial voice messages 
if monitronics dealers were to take actions in violation of these regulations  such as telemarketing to individuals on the do not call registry  monitronics itself could be subject to fines  penalties  private actions or enforcement actions by government regulators 
although monitronics has taken steps to insulate itself from any such wrongful conduct by its dealers  and to require its dealers to comply with these laws and regulations  no assurance can be given that monitronics will not be exposed to liability as result of their dealers conduct 
further  to the extent that any changes in law or regulation further restrict the lead generation activity of monitronics dealers  these restrictions could result in a material reduction in subscriber acquisition opportunities  reducing the growth prospects of monitronics business and adversely affecting its financial condition and future cash flows 
in addition  most states in which monitronics operates have licensing laws directed specifically toward the monitored security services industry 
monitronics business relies heavily upon wireline and cellular telephone service to communicate signals 
wireline and cellular telephone companies are currently regulated by both federal and state governments 
changes in laws or regulations could require monitronics to change the way it operates  which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt operations 
in addition  failure to comply with any such applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of monitronics operating permits and licenses  including in geographic areas where monitronics services have substantial penetration  which could adversely affect monitronics business and financial condition 
further  if these laws and regulations were to change or monitronics failed to comply with such laws and regulations as they exist today or in the future  monitronics business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
increased adoption of statutes and governmental policies purporting to void automatic renewal provisions in the amas  or purporting to characterize certain charges in the amas as unlawful  could adversely affect monitronics business and operations 
the amas typically contain provisions automatically renewing the term of the contract at the end of the initial term  unless a cancellation notice is delivered in accordance with the terms of the contract 
if the customer cancels prior to the end of the contract term  other than in accordance with the contract  monitronics may charge the customer the amounts that would have been paid over the remaining term of the contract  or charge an early cancellation fee 
several states have adopted  or are considering the adoption of  consumer protection policies or legal precedents which purport to void or substantially limit the automatic renewal provisions of contracts such as the amas  or otherwise restrict the charges that can be imposed upon contract cancellation 
such initiatives could negatively impact monitronics business 
adverse judicial determinations regarding these matters could increase legal exposure to customers against whom such charges have been imposed  and the risk that certain customers may seek to recover such charges through litigation 
in addition  the costs of defending such litigation and enforcement actions could have an adverse effect on monitronics business and operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information concerning our results of operations and financial condition 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
at december   our assets consisted primarily of our wholly owned operating subsidiary  monitronics 
monitronics on december   we acquired of the outstanding capital stock of monitronics  through the merger of mono lake merger sub  inc  a direct wholly owned subsidiary of ascent capital established to consummate the merger  with and into monitronics  with monitronics as the surviving corporation in the merger the monitronics acquisition 
the cash consideration paid in connection with the merger was  the consideration was funded by a  term loan  a draw of  on an 
table of contents  revolving credit facility and cash on hand 
we also assumed approximately  in net debt which we define as the principal amount of such debt less monitronics cash of monitronics 
monitronics provides security alarm monitoring and related services to residential and business subscribers throughout the us and parts of canada 
monitronics monitors signals arising from burglaries  fires  medical alerts and other events through security systems at subscribers premises 
nearly all of its revenues are derived from monthly recurring revenues under security alarm monitoring contracts purchased from independent dealers in its exclusive nationwide network 
revenues are recognized as the related monitoring services are provided 
other revenues are derived primarily from the provision of third party contract monitoring services and from field technical repair services 
all direct external costs associated with the creation of subscriber accounts are capitalized and amortized over fourteen to fifteen years using a declining balance method beginning in the month following the date of purchase 
internal costs  including all personnel and related support costs incurred solely in connection with subscriber account acquisitions and transitions  are expensed as incurred 
account cancellation  otherwise referred to as subscriber attrition  has a direct impact on the number of subscribers that monitronics services and on its financial results  including revenues  operating income and cash flow 
a portion of the subscriber base can be expected to cancel its service every year 
subscribers may choose not to renew or terminate their contract for a variety of reasons  including relocation  cost and switching to a competitors service 
the largest category of canceled accounts relate to subscriber relocation or the inability to contact the subscriber 
monitronics defines its attrition rate as the number of canceled accounts in a given period divided by the weighted average of number of subscribers for that period 
monitronics considers an account canceled if payment from the subscriber is deemed uncollectible or if the subscriber cancels for various reasons 
if a subscriber relocates but continues its service  this is not a cancellation 
if the subscriber relocates  discontinues its service and a new subscriber takes over the original subscriber s service continuing the revenue stream a new owner takeover  this is also not a cancellation 
monitronics adjusts the number of canceled accounts by excluding those that are contractually guaranteed by its dealers 
the typical dealer contract provides that if a subscriber cancels in the first year of its contract  the dealer must either replace the canceled account with a new one or refund the purchase price 
to help ensure the dealer s obligation to monitronics  monitronics typically holds back a portion of the purchase price for every account purchased  ranging from 
in some cases  the amount of the purchase holdback may be less than actual attrition experience 
the table below presents subscriber data for the twelve months ended december  and twelve months ended december  beginning balance of accounts accounts purchased a accounts cancelled b accounts guaranteed to be refunded by dealer ending balance of accounts monthly weighted average accounts attrition rate a during the three months ended december  and  monitronics purchased  and  subscriber accounts  respectively 
monthly recurring revenue purchased during the three months ended december  and was approximately  and  respectively 
monthly recurring revenue purchased during the twelve months ended december  and was approximately  and  b net of canceled accounts that are contractually guaranteed by the dealer 
the attrition rate for the twelve months ended december  and was and  respectively 
increased attrition reflects the current age of accounts in the portfolio and an increase in disconnections due to household relocations 
monitronics also analyzes its attrition by classifying accounts into annual pools based on the year of purchase 
monitronics then tracks the number of accounts that cancel as a percentage of the initial number of accounts purchased for each pool for each year subsequent to its purchase 
based on the average cancellation rate across the pools  in recent years monitronics has averaged less than attrition within the initial month period after considering the accounts which were replaced or refunded by the dealers at no additional cost to monitronics 
over the next few years of the subscriber account life  the number of subscribers that cancel as a 
table of contents percentage of the initial number of subscribers in that pool gradually increases and historically has peaked following the end of the initial contract term  which is typically three to five years 
the peak following the end of the initial contract term is primarily a result of the buildup of subscribers that moved or no longer had need for the service but did not cancel their service until the end of their initial contract term 
subsequent to the peak following the end of the initial contract term  the number of subscribers that cancel as a percentage of the initial number of subscribers in that pool declines 
adjusted ebitda we evaluate the performance of our operations based on financial measures such as revenue and adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda is defined as net income loss before interest expense  interest income  income taxes  depreciation  amortization including the amortization of subscriber accounts and dealer network  realized and unrealized gain loss on derivative instruments  restructuring charges  stock based and other non cash long term incentive compensation  and other non cash or nonrecurring charges 
ascent capital believes that adjusted ebitda is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of its business  including the business ability to fund its ongoing acquisition of subscriber accounts  its capital expenditures and to service its debt 
in addition  this measure is used by management to evaluate operating results and perform analytical comparisons and identify strategies to improve performance 
adjusted ebitda is also a measure that is customarily used by financial analysts to evaluate the financial performance of companies in the security alarm monitoring industry and is one of the financial measures  subject to certain adjustments  by which monitronics covenants are calculated under the agreements governing their debt obligations 
adjusted ebitda does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap  should not be construed as an alternative to net income or loss and is indicative neither of our results of operations nor of cash flows available to fund all of our cash needs 
it is  however  a measurement that ascent capital believes is useful to investors in analyzing its operating performance 
accordingly  adjusted ebitda should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for  net income  cash flow provided by operating activities and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure 
as companies often define non gaap financial measures differently  adjusted ebitda as calculated by ascent capital should not be compared to any similarly titled measures reported by other companies

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates valuation of subscriber accounts subscriber accounts  which totaled  net of accumulated amortization  at december   relate to the cost of acquiring portfolios of monitoring service contracts from independent dealers 
the subscriber accounts acquired in the monitronics acquisition were recorded at fair value under the purchase method of accounting 
subscriber accounts purchased subsequent to the acquisition are recorded at cost 
all direct external costs associated with the creation of subscriber accounts are capitalized 
internal costs  including all personnel and related support costs  incurred solely in connection with subscriber account acquisitions and transitions are expensed as incurred 
the costs of subscriber accounts acquired in the monitronics acquisition  as well as certain accounts acquired in bulk purchases  are amortized using the year declining balance method 
the costs of all other subscriber accounts are amortized using the year declining balance method  beginning in the month following the date of purchase 
the amortization methods were selected to provide an approximate matching of the amortization of the subscriber accounts intangible asset to estimated future subscriber revenues based on the projected lives of individual subscriber contracts 
the realizable value and remaining useful lives of these assets could be impacted by changes in subscriber attrition rates  which could have an adverse effect on our earnings 
the company reviews the subscriber accounts for impairment or a change in amortization method and period whenever events or changes indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable or the life should be shortened 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss  we view subscriber accounts as a single pool because of the assets homogeneous characteristics  and because the pool of subscriber accounts is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of the other assets and liabilities 
valuation of long lived assets and amortizable other intangible assets we perform impairment tests for our long lived assets  primarily property and equipment  if an event or circumstance indicates that the carrying amount of our long lived assets may not be recoverable 
we are subject to the possibility of impairment of long lived assets arising in the ordinary course of business 
we regularly consider the likelihood of impairment and may recognize impairment if the carrying amount of a long lived asset or intangible asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows 
impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
we use both the income approach and market approach to estimate fair value 
our estimates of fair value are subject to a high degree of judgment since they include a long term forecast of future operations 
accordingly  any value ultimately derived from our long lived assets may differ from our estimate of fair value 
valuation of trade receivables we must make estimates of the collectability of our trade receivables 
we perform extensive credit evaluations on the portfolios of subscriber accounts prior to purchase and require no collateral on the accounts that are acquired 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of subscribers to make required payments 
factors such as historical loss experience  recoveries and economic conditions are considered in determining the sufficiency of the allowance to cover potential losses 
our trade receivables balance was  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of december  as of december   our trade receivables balance was  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  valuation of deferred tax assets in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  income taxes  we review the nature of each component of our deferred income taxes for the ability to realize the future tax benefits 
as part of this review  we rely on the objective evidence of our current performance and the subjective evidence of estimates of our forecast of future operations 
our estimates of realizability are subject to a high degree of judgment since they include such forecasts of future operations 
after consideration of all available positive and negative evidence and estimates  we have determined that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the tax benefits associated with our united states deferred tax assets and certain foreign deferred tax assets  and as such  we have a valuation allowance which totaled  and  as of december  and  respectively 

table of contents valuation of goodwill as of december   we had goodwill of  which represents approximately of total assets 
this goodwill was recorded in connection with the monitronics acquisition on december  the company accounts for its goodwill pursuant to the provisions of fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other fasb asc topic 
in accordance with fasb asc topic  goodwill is not amortized  but rather tested for impairment at least annually 
to the extent necessary  recoverability of goodwill for the reporting unit is measured using a discounted cash flow model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved  which is classified as a level measurement under fasb asc topic  fair value measurement 
the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates  growth rates  cash flow projections and terminal value rates 
discount rates  growth rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
in the event that we are not able to achieve expected cash flow levels  or other factors indicate that goodwill is impaired  we may need to write off all or part of our goodwill  which would adversely impact our operating results and financial position
