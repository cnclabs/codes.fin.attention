deposits the composition and cost of the company deposit base are important in analyzing the company net interest margin and balance sheet liquidity characteristics 
except for brokered time deposits  the company depositors are generally located in its primary market area 
depending on loan demand and other funding requirements  the company also obtains deposits from wholesale sources including deposit brokers 
the company had million in brokered deposits at december   compared to million at december  deposits from title insurance companies  escrow accounts and real estate exchange facilitators decreased to million at december   compared to million at december  certificates of deposit from the state of california totaled million at december   compared to million at december  deposits at december  were billion  compared to billion at december  core deposits excluding all time deposits  cdars deposits and the million of short term demand deposits from one customer increased to million at december   an increase of million  or from december  the ratio of noncore funding to total assets was at december   excluding the short term deposits at the federal reserve bank offsetting the short term demand deposits from one customer 
the company has a policy to monitor all deposits that may be sensitive to interest rate changes to help assure that liquidity risk does not become excessive due to concentrations 
hbc is a member of the certificate of deposit account registry service cdars program 
the cdars program allows customers with deposits in excess of fdic insured limits to obtain coverage on time deposits through a network of banks within the cdars program 
deposits gathered through this 
table of contents program are considered brokered deposits under regulatory guidelines 
deposits in the cdars program totaled million at december   compared to million at december  liquidity our liquidity position refers to our ability to maintain cash flows sufficient to fund operations and to meet obligations and other commitments in a timely fashion 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents million  excluding the short term deposits at the federal reserve bank offsetting the short term demand deposits from one customer and approximately million in available borrowing capacity from various sources including the fhlb  the frb  and federal funds facilities with several financial institutions 
the company also had million in unpledged securities available at december  our loan to deposit ratio decreased to at december   compared to at december   primarily due to an increase in core deposits 
the loan to deposit ratio was at december   excluding the short term demand deposits of million from one customer 
lending our lending business originates primarily through our branch offices located in our primary market 
the company also has an additional sba loan production office in santa rosa  california 
total loans  excluding loans held for sale  increased million  or  to million at december   compared to million at december  the total loan portfolio remains well diversified with commercial and industrial c i loans accounting for of the portfolio at december  commercial and residential real estate loans accounted for of the total loan portfolio at december   of which were owner occupied by businesses 
consumer and home equity loans accounted for of the total loan portfolio  and land and construction loans accounted for the remaining of our total loan portfolio at december  the yield on the loan portfolio was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the yield on the loan portfolio for year ended december   compared to the same period in  was primarily the result of lower yields on renewals 
net interest income the management of interest income and expense is fundamental to the performance of the company 
net interest income  the difference between interest income and interest expense  is the largest component of the company total revenue 
because of our focus on commercial lending to closely held businesses  the company will continue to have a high percentage of floating rate loans and other assets 
management closely monitors both total net interest income and the net interest margin net interest income divided by average earning assets 
the company  through its asset and liability policies and practices  seeks to maximize net interest income without exposing the company to an excessive level of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is managed by monitoring the pricing  maturity and repricing options of all classes of interest bearing assets and liabilities 
this is discussed in more detail under liquidity and asset liability management 
in addition  we believe there are measures and initiatives we can take to improve the net interest margin  including increasing loan rates  adding floors on floating rate loans  reducing nonperforming assets  managing deposit interest rates  and reducing higher cost deposits 
the net interest margin is also adversely impacted by the reversal of interest on nonaccrual loans and the reinvestment of loan payoffs into lower yielding investment securities and other short term investments 

table of contents management of credit risk we continue to proactively identify  quantify  and manage our problem loans 
early identification of problem loans and potential future losses helps enable us to resolve credit issues with potentially less risk and ultimate losses 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses in an amount that we believe is adequate to absorb probable incurred losses in the portfolio 
while we strive to carefully manage and monitor credit quality and to identify loans that may be deteriorating  circumstances can change at any time for loans included in the portfolio that may result in future losses  that as of the date of the financial statements have not yet been identified as potential problem loans 
through established credit practices  we adjust the allowance for loan losses accordingly 
however  because future events are uncertain  there may be loans that deteriorate some of which could occur in an accelerated time frame 
as a result  future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary 
because the loan portfolio contains a number of commercial loans  commercial real estate  construction and land development loans with relatively large balances  deterioration in the credit quality of one or more of these loans may require a significant increase to the allowance for loan losses 
future additions to the allowance may also be required based on changes in the financial condition of borrowers  such as have resulted due to the current  and potentially worsening  economic conditions 
additionally  federal and state banking regulators  as an integral part of their supervisory function  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
these regulatory agencies may require us to recognize further loan loss provisions or charge offs based upon their judgments  which may be different from ours 
any increase in the allowance for loan losses would have an adverse effect  which may be material  on our financial condition and results of operation 
further discussion of the management of credit risk appears under provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses 
noninterest income while net interest income remains the largest single component of total revenues  noninterest income is an important component 
a portion of the company noninterest income is associated with its sba lending activity  consisting of gains on the sale of loans sold in the secondary market and servicing income from loans sold with servicing retained 
other sources of noninterest income include loan servicing fees  service charges and fees  cash surrender value from company owned life insurance policies  gains on the disposition of foreclosed assets  and gains on the sale of securities 
the company sold million of agency mortgage backed securities for a gain on sales of securities of million for the year ended december   compared to a  gain on sales of securities for the year ended december  noninterest expense management considers the control of operating expenses to be a critical element of the company performance 
the company has undertaken several initiatives to reduce its noninterest expense and improve its efficiency 
noninterest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million a year ago 
the increase from year to year primarily resulted from the redemption of the million fixed rate subordinated debt prior to its maturity date  which resulted in a charge of  during the third quarter of  and higher salaries and employee benefits costs 
capital management as part of its asset and liability management process  the company continually assesses its capital position to take into consideration growth  expected earnings  risk profile and potential corporate activities that it may choose to pursue 

table of contents on november   the company issued to the us treasury under its capital purchase program  shares of series a preferred stock for million and issued a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of 
on march   in accordance with approvals received from the us treasury and the federal reserve  the company repurchased all shares of the series a preferred stock and paid the related accrued and unpaid dividends 
the repurchase of the series a preferred stock will save million in annual dividends 
at the time the company repurchased the series a preferred stock  it did not repurchase the related warrant 
the warrant was outstanding as of the date of this report 
on june   the company issued series c convertible perpetual preferred stock series c preferred stock to a limited number of institutional investors 
the series c preferred stock remains outstanding until its conversion to common stock upon the transfer of the series c preferred stock in accordance with its terms 
holders of series c preferred stock will receive dividends if and only to the extent dividends are paid to holders of common stock 
we have supported our growth through the issuance of trust preferred securities from special purpose trusts and accompanying sales of subordinated debt to these trusts 
the subordinated debt that we issued to the trusts is senior to our shares of common stock and series c preferred stock 
as a result  we must make payments on the subordinated debt before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and series c preferred stock 
under the terms of the subordinated debt  we may defer interest payments for up to five years 
during the third quarter of  the company completed the redemption of million fixed rate subordinated debt  and has million of variable rate subordinated debt outstanding at year end the company is current with respect to interest accrued on trust preferred subordinated debt securities as of december  results of operations the company earns income from two primary sources 
the first is net interest income  which is interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
the second is noninterest income  which primarily consists of gains on the sale of loans  loan servicing fees  customer service charges and fees  the increase in cash surrender value of life insurance  and gains on the sale of securities 
the majority of the company noninterest expenses are operating costs that relate to providing a full range of banking services to our customers 
net interest income and net interest margin the level of net interest income depends on several factors in combination  including growth in earning assets  yields on earning assets  the cost of interest bearing liabilities  the relative volumes of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the mix of products that comprise the company earning assets  deposits  and other interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income can also be impacted by the reversal of interest on loans placed on nonaccrual status  and recovery of interest on loans that have been on nonaccrual and are either sold or returned to accrual status 
to maintain its net interest margin  the company must manage the relationship between interest earned and paid 

table of contents the following distribution  rate and yield table presents for each of the past three years  the average amounts outstanding for the major categories of the company balance sheet  the average interest rates earned or paid thereon  and the resulting net interest margin on average interest earning assets for the periods indicated

the company net interest margin  expressed as a percentage of average earning assets was for  a decrease of basis points compared to for  principally due to lower yields on loans and securities  partially offset by a lower cost of funds 
the company net interest margin for increased basis points compared to for  principally due to a higher yield on loans and a lower cost of deposits 
the yield on interest earning assets decreased to for  compared to for  and for  primarily due to contraction in the loan portfolio 
the cost of total deposits  including noninterest bearing demand deposits  decreased to for  compared to for  and for  as a result of maturing higher cost wholesale funding and a more cost effective blend of core deposits 

table of contents net interest income for the year ended december  increased million to million  compared to million a year ago  primarily due to a an increase in the average balance of investment securities  and a decrease in the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of loans 
net interest income for the year ended december  increased million to million  compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in average balance of investment securities  and a decrease the average balance and in rates paid on interest bearing liabilities partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of loans 
a substantial portion of the company earning assets are variable rate loans that re price when the company prime lending rate is changed  in contrast to a large base of core deposits that are generally slower to re price 
this causes the company balance sheet to be asset sensitive which means that  all else being equal  the company net interest margin will be lower during periods when short term interest rates are falling and higher when rates are rising 
provision for loan losses credit risk is inherent in the business of making loans 
the company establishes an allowance for loan losses through charges to earnings  which are shown in the statements of operations as the provision for loan losses 
specifically identifiable and quantifiable known losses are promptly charged off against the allowance 
the provision for loan losses is determined by conducting a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the company allowance for loan losses and charging the shortfall  if any  to the current quarter operations 
this has the effect of creating variability in the amount and frequency of charges to the company earnings 
the provision for loan losses and level of allowance for each period are dependent upon many factors  including loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquencies  management assessment of the quality of the loan portfolio  the valuation of problem loans and the general economic conditions in the company market area 
the company had a provision for loan losses of million for the year ended december   compared to a provision for loan losses of million for the year ended december   and a provision for loan losses of million for the year ended december  the decrease in the provision for loan losses in compared to and reflects the improvement in credit quality 
the allowance for loan losses represented  and of total loans at december   and  respectively 
the year over year decrease in the allowance for loan losses was primarily due to improved risk grading and credit metrics on non impaired real estate loans  as well as a decline in historical charge off levels 
annualized net charge offs as a percentage of average loans were as of december   as compared to as of december   and as of december  the year over year decrease was partially offset by an increase in the allowance for loan losses on impaired real estate loans 
provisions for loan losses are charged to operations to bring the allowance for loan losses to a level deemed appropriate by the company based on the factors discussed under allowance for loan losses

the decrease in noninterest income for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to a lower gain on sales of securities  which was partially offset by an  loss on sales of other loans during the company sold million of agency mortgage backed securities for a gain of million during the year ended december   compared to a  gain during the year ended december   and a million gain during the year ended december  a portion of the company noninterest income is associated with its sba lending activity  as gain on sales of loans sold in the secondary market and servicing income from loans sold with servicing rights retained

servicing income generally declines as the respective loans are repaid

the company low income housing investment losses increased  or  to million for  compared to  for income tax expense the company computes its provision for income taxes on a monthly basis 
the effective tax rate is determined by applying the company statutory income tax rates to pre tax book income as adjusted for permanent differences between pre tax book income and actual taxable income 
these permanent differences include  but are not limited to  tax exempt interest income  increases in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies  california enterprise zone deductions  certain expenses that are not allowed as tax deductions  and tax credits 
the company federal and state income tax expense in was million  as compared to an income tax benefit of  in  and an income tax benefit of million in the income tax benefit of  in included the elimination of a million partial valuation allowance for the company deferred tax asset 
the following table shows the effective income tax rates for   and for the year ended december  effective income tax rate the difference in the effective tax rate compared to the combined federal and state statutory tax rate of is primarily the result of the company investment in life insurance policies whose earnings are not subject to taxes  tax credits related to investments in low income housing limited partnerships  goodwill impairment  and the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 

table of contents the company has total investments of million in low income housing limited partnerships as of december  these investments have generated annual tax credits of approximately  for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  some items of income and expense are recognized in different years for tax purposes than when applying generally accepted accounting principles leading to timing differences between the company actual tax liability  and the amount accrued for this liability based on book income 
these temporary differences comprise the deferred portion of the company tax expense or benefit  which is accumulated on the company books as a deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability until such time as they reverse 
realization of the company deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the company generating sufficient future taxable income to obtain benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences and utilization of tax credit carryforwards and the net operating loss carryforwards for federal and california state income tax purposes 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods based on estimates of future taxable income 
under generally accepted accounting principles a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management evaluation of both positive and negative evidence  including forecasts of future income  cumulative losses  applicable tax planning strategies  and assessments of current and future economic and business conditions 
the company had net deferred tax assets of million and million at december   and december   respectively 
after consideration of the matters in the preceding paragraph  the company determined that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset at december  and december  will be fully realized in future years

the securities portfolio is the second largest component of the company interest earning assets  and the structure and composition of this portfolio is important to an analysis of the financial condition of the company 
the portfolio serves the following purposes i it provides a source of pledged assets for securing certain deposits and borrowed funds  as may be required by law or by specific agreement with a 
table of contents depositor or lender  ii it provides liquidity to even out cash flows from the loan and deposit activities of customers  iii it can be used as an interest rate risk management tool  since it provides a large base of assets  the maturity and interest rate characteristics of which can be changed more readily than the loan portfolio to better match changes in the deposit base and other funding sources of the company  and iv it is an alternative interest earning use of funds when loan demand is weak or when deposits grow more rapidly than loans 
the company portfolio may include i us treasury securities and us government sponsored entities debt securities for liquidity and pledging  ii mortgage backed securities  which in many instances can also be used for pledging  and which generally enhance the yield of the portfolio  iii municipal obligations  which provide tax free income and limited pledging potential  iv collateralized mortgage obligations  which generally enhance the yield of the portfolio  and v single entity issue trust preferred securities  which generally enhance the yield on the portfolio 
the company classifies its securities as either available for sale or held to maturity at the time of purchase 
prior to the third quarter of  the company securities were all classified under existing accounting rules as available for sale to allow flexibility for the management of the portfolio

since loans are the most significant assets of the company and generate the largest portion of its revenues  the company management of credit quality risk is focused primarily on loan quality 
banks 
table of contents have generally suffered their most severe earnings declines as a result of customers inability to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debts and or downturns in national and regional economies and declines in overall asset values including real estate 
in addition  certain debt securities that the company may purchase have the potential of declining in value if the obligor financial capacity to repay deteriorates 
the company policies and procedures identify market segments  set goals for portfolio growth or contraction  and establish limits on industry and geographic credit concentrations 
in addition  these policies establish the company underwriting standards and the methods of monitoring ongoing credit quality 
the company internal credit risk controls are centered in underwriting practices  credit granting procedures  training  risk management techniques  and familiarity with loan customers as well as the relative diversity and geographic concentration of our loan portfolio 
the company credit risk may also be affected by external factors such as the level of interest rates  employment  general economic conditions  real estate values  and trends in particular industries or geographic markets 
as an independent community bank serving a specific geographic area  the company must contend with the unpredictable changes in the general california market and  particularly  primary local markets 
the company asset quality has suffered in the past from the impact of national and regional economic recessions  consumer bankruptcies  and depressed real estate values 
nonperforming assets are comprised of the following loans and loans held for sale for which the company is no longer accruing interest  restructured loans which have been current under six months  loans days or more past due and still accruing interest although they are generally placed on nonaccrual when they become days past due  unless they are both well secured and in the process of collection  and foreclosed assets 
management classification of a loan as nonaccrual is an indication that there is reasonable doubt as to the full recovery of principal or interest on the loan 
at that point  the company stops accruing interest income  and reverses any uncollected interest that had been accrued as income 
the company begins recognizing interest income only as cash interest payments are received and it has been determined the collection of all outstanding principal is not in doubt 
the loans may or may not be collateralized  and collection efforts are pursued 
loans may be restructured by management when a borrower has experienced some change in financial status causing an inability to meet the original repayment terms and where the company believes the borrower will eventually overcome those circumstances and make full restitution 
foreclosed assets consist of properties and other assets acquired by foreclosure or similar means

loans are charged off against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance for loan losses 
management methodology for estimating the allowance balance consists of several key elements  which include specific allowances on individual impaired loans and the formula driven allowances on pools of loans with similar risk characteristics 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that in management judgment should be charged off 
specific allowances are established for impaired loans 
management considers a loan to be impaired when it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement  including scheduled interest payments 
loans for which the terms have been modified with a concession granted  and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties  are considered troubled debt restructurings and classified as impaired 
when a loan is considered to be impaired  the amount of impairment is measured based on the fair value of the collateral  
table of contents less costs to sell  if the loan is collateral dependent or on the present value of expected future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market 
if the measure of the impaired loans is less than the investment in the loan  the deficiency will be charged off against the allowance for loan losses if the amount is a confirmed loss  or  alternatively  a specific allocation within the allowance will be established 
loans that are considered impaired are specifically excluded from the formula portion of the allowance for loan loss analysis 
the estimated loss factors for pools of loans that are not impaired are based on determining the probability of default and loss given default for loans within each segment of the portfolio  adjusted for significant factors that  in management judgment  affect collectibility as of the evaluation date 
the company historical delinquency experience and loss experience are utilized to determine the probability of default and loss given default for segments of the portfolio where the company has experienced losses in the past 
for segments of the portfolio where the company has no significant prior loss experience  the company uses quantifiable observable industry data to determine the probability of default and loss given default 
loans that demonstrate a weakness for which there is a possibility of loss if the weakness is not corrected are categorized as classified 
classified assets include all loans considered as substandard  substandard nonaccrual  and doubtful and may result from problems specific to a borrower business or from economic downturns that affect the borrower ability to repay or that cause a decline in the value of the underlying collateral particularly real estate  and foreclosed assets 
the principal balance of classified assets  net of sba guarantees  was million at december   million at december   and million at december  included in classified assets at december  and december  were  and million  respectively  of loans held for sale 
there were no loans held for sale included in classified assets at december  loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value  and are not allocated an allowance for loan losses 
management of the level of classified assets will continue to be a focus for executive management  the lending staff and the company special assets department 
it is the policy of management to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level adequate for risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
on an ongoing basis  we have engaged an outside firm to perform independent credit reviews of our loan portfolio 
the federal reserve bank of san francisco and the california department of financial institutions also review the allowance for loan losses as an integral part of the examination process 
based on information currently available  management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
however  the loan portfolio can be adversely affected if california economic conditions and the real estate market in the company market area were to further weaken 
also  any weakness of a prolonged nature in the technology industry would have a negative impact on the local market 
the effect of such events  although uncertain at this time  could result in an increase in the level of nonperforming loans and increased loan losses  which could adversely affect the company future growth and profitability 
no assurance of the ultimate level of credit losses can be given with any certainty

loan charge offs reflect the realization of losses in the portfolio that were partially recognized previously through provisions for loan losses 
net charge offs were million in  compared to net charge offs of million in  and net charge offs of million in historical net loan charge offs are not necessarily indicative of the amount of net charge offs that the company will realize in the future 
the following table provides a summary of the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for specific categories at the dates indicated

the decrease in the allowance for loan losses was primarily due to improved risk grading and credit metrics on commercial loans  as well as a decline in historical charge off levels 
the allowance for loan losses related to the real estate portfolio decreased million during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   as a result of a credit to the provision for loan losses of  and net charge offs of million 
the decrease in the allowance for loan losses was primarily due to improved risk grading and credit metrics on non impaired real estate loans  as well as a decline in historical charge off levels 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in the allowance for loan losses on impaired real estate loans 
prior to  management considered the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses necessary because of inherent subjective risk in the loan portfolio  however  this methodology did not distinguish this subjective allocation by loan segment 
the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses was reallocated to the respective loan categories in  which management believes improves its ability to allocate probable credit losses to loan segments 
management considers this matter to be a reallocation in its allowance for loan losses calculation  and believes that there would be no significant change in the balance of the allowance for loan losses if this approach was used in each of the years presented 
deposits the composition and cost of the company deposit base are important components in analyzing the company net interest margin and balance sheet liquidity characteristics  both of which are discussed in greater detail in other sections in this report 
the company liquidity is impacted by the volatility of deposits or other funding instruments or  in other words  by the propensity of that money to leave the institution for rate related or other reasons 
deposits can be adversely affected if economic conditions in california  and the company market area in particular  continue to weaken 
potentially  the most volatile deposits in a financial institution are jumbo certificates of deposit  meaning time deposits with balances

liquidity and asset liability management liquidity refers to the company ability to maintain cash flows sufficient to fund operations and to meet obligations and other commitments in a timely and cost effective fashion 
at various times the company requires funds to meet short term cash requirements brought about by loan growth or deposit outflows  the purchase of assets  or liability repayments 
an integral part of the company ability to manage its liquidity position appropriately is the company large base of core deposits  which are generated by offering traditional banking services in its service area and which have  historically  been a stable source of funds 
to manage liquidity needs properly  cash inflows must be timed to coincide with anticipated outflows or sufficient liquidity resources must be available to meet varying demands 
the company manages liquidity to be able to meet unexpected sudden changes in levels of its assets or deposit liabilities without maintaining excessive amounts of balance sheet liquidity 
excess balance sheet liquidity can negatively impact the company interest margin 
in order to meet short term liquidity needs the company may utilize overnight federal funds purchase arrangements and other borrowing arrangements with correspondent banks  solicit brokered deposits if cost effective deposits are not available from local sources and maintain collateralized lines of credit with the fhlb and frb 
in addition  the company can raise cash for temporary needs by selling securities under agreements to repurchase and selling securities available for sale

the company market risk exposure is primarily that of interest rate risk  and it has established policies and procedures to monitor and limit earnings and balance sheet exposure to changes in interest rates 
the company does not engage in the trading of financial instruments  nor does the company have exposure to currency exchange rates 
the principal objective of interest rate risk management often referred to as asset liability management is to manage the financial components of the company in a manner that will optimize the risk reward equation for earnings and capital in relation to changing interest rates 
the company exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the asset liability committee 
interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes 
these economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and or a loss of current fair market values 
the objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximizing income 
management realizes certain risks are inherent  and that the goal is to identify and manage the risks 
management uses two methodologies to manage interest rate risk i a standard gap analysis  and ii an interest rate shock simulation model 
the planning of asset and liability maturities is an integral part of the management of an institution net interest margin 
to the extent maturities of assets and liabilities do not match in a changing interest rate environment  the net interest margin may change over time 
even with perfectly matched repricing of assets and liabilities  risks remain in the form of prepayment of loans or securities or in the form of delays in the adjustment of rates of interest applying to either earning assets with floating rates or to interest bearing liabilities 
the company has generally been able to control its exposure to changing interest rates by maintaining primarily floating interest rate loans and a majority of its time certificates with relatively short maturities 
interest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or at the same time 
varying interest rate environments can create unexpected changes in prepayment levels of assets and liabilities  which may have a significant effect on the net interest margin and are not reflected in the interest sensitivity analysis table 
because of these factors  an interest sensitivity gap report may not provide a complete assessment of the exposure to changes in interest rates 
the company uses modeling software for asset liability management in order to simulate the effects of potential interest rate changes on the company net interest margin  and to calculate the estimated fair values of the company financial instruments under different interest rate scenarios 
the program imports current balances  interest rates  maturity dates and repricing information for individual financial instruments  and incorporates assumptions on the characteristics of embedded options along with pricing and duration for new volumes to project the effects of a given interest rate change on the company interest income and interest expense 
rate scenarios consisting of key rate and yield curve projections are run against the company investment  loan  deposit and borrowed funds portfolios 
these rate projections can be shocked an immediate and parallel change in all base rates  up or down and ramped an 
table of contents incremental increase or decrease in rates over a specified time period  based on current trends and econometric models or stable economic conditions unchanged from current actual levels 
the following table sets forth the estimated changes in the company net interest income that would result from the designated instantaneous parallel shift in interest rates noted  as of december  computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and deposit decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
increase decrease in estimated net interest income amount percent dollars in thousands change in interest rates basis points this data does not reflect any actions that we may undertake in response to changes in interest rates such as changes in rates paid on certain deposit accounts based on local competitive factors  which could reduce the actual impact on net interest income  if any 
as with any method of gauging interest rate risk  there are certain shortcomings inherent to the methodology noted above 
the model assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve 
in reality  rate changes are rarely instantaneous 
the use of the simplifying assumption that short term and long term rates change by the same degree may also misstate historic rate patterns  which rarely show parallel yield curve shifts 
further  the model assumes that certain assets and liabilities of similar maturity or period to repricing will react in the same way to changes in rates 
in reality  certain types of financial instruments may react in advance of changes in market rates  while the reaction of other types of financial instruments may lag behind the change in general market rates 
additionally  the methodology noted above does not reflect the full impact of annual and lifetime restrictions on changes in rates for certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans 
when interest rates change  actual loan prepayments and actual early withdrawals from certificates may deviate significantly from the assumptions used in the model 
finally  this methodology does not measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have on adjustable rate loan clients ability to service their debt 
all of these factors are considered in monitoring the company exposure to interest rate risk 
critical accounting policies general the company consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america and general practices in the banking industry 
the financial statements include the accounts of the company 
all inter company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the 
table of contents reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the allowance for loan losses  carrying value of foreclosed assets  deferred tax assets and liabilities  intangible assets  loan servicing rights  interest only strip receivables  defined benefit pension and split dollar life insurance benefit plan and the fair values of financial instruments are particularly subject to change 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses in our loan portfolio 
our accounting for estimated loan losses was previously discussed under the heading allowance for loan losses 
loan sales and servicing the amounts of gains recorded on sales of loans and the initial recording of servicing assets and i o strips are based on the estimated fair values of the respective components 
in recording the initial value of the servicing assets and the fair value of the i o strips receivable  the company uses estimates which are made on management expectations of future prepayment and discount rates as discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation we grant stock options to purchase our common stock also to our employees and directors under the plan 
additionally  we have outstanding options that were granted under an option plan from which we no longer make grants 
the benefits provided under all of these plans are subject to the provisions of accounting guidance related to share based payments 
our results of operations for fiscal years   and were impacted by the recognition of non cash expense related to the fair value of our share based compensation awards 
the determination of fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes model is affected by our stock price  as well as the input of other subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  the expected term of stock options and our stock price volatility 
our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates 
accounting guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
if actual forfeitures vary from our estimates  we will recognize the difference in compensation expense in the period the actual forfeitures occur 
our accounting for stock options is disclosed primarily in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets the company accounts for acquisitions of businesses using the purchase method of accounting 
our accounting for goodwill was previously discussed under the heading goodwill and disclosed primarily in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
intangible assets consist of core deposit and customer relationship intangible assets arising from the acquisition of diablo valley bank in june our accounting for intangible assets was previously discussed under the heading intangible assets and disclosed primarily in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents deferred tax assets our net deferred income tax asset arises from temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements and the amounts used for income tax return purposes 
our accounting for deferred tax assets was previously discussed under the heading income tax expense and disclosed primarily in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a financial institution  the company primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of the company assets and liabilities and the market value of all interest earning assets  other than those which have a short term to maturity 
based upon the nature of the company operations  the company is not subject to foreign exchange or commodity price risk 
the company has no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purposes 
as of december   the company did not use interest rate derivatives to hedge its interest rate risk 
the information concerning quantitative and qualitative disclosure or market risk called for by item of regulation s k is included as part of item of this report
