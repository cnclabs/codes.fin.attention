operating statement classifications net sales 
net sales from our operations are a factor of volumes shipped  product mix and related pricing 
we charge premium prices for certain grades of steel  product dimensions  certain smaller volumes  and for value added processing or coating of the steel products 
except for our steel fabrication operations segment  we recognize revenue from sales and the allowance for estimated returns from these sales at the time the title of the product is transferred to the customer 
provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on estimates and actual historical experience 
net sales from steel fabrication operations are recognized from construction contracts utilizing a percentage of completion method  which is based on the percentage of steel consumed to date as compared to the estimated total steel required for each contract 
costs of goods sold 
our costs of goods sold represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the manufacture of our products 
the principal elements of these costs are scrap and scrap substitutes which represent the most significant single component of our consolidated costs of goods sold  steel  direct and indirect labor and related benefits  alloys  zinc  transportation and freight  repairs and maintenance  utilities most notably electricity and natural gas  and depreciation 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of all costs associated with our sales  finance and accounting  and administrative departments 
these 
table of contents costs include  among other items  labor and related benefits  professional services  insurance premiums  property taxes  profit sharing  and amortization of intangible and other assets 
interest expense  net of capitalized interest 
interest expense consists of interest associated with our senior credit facilities and other debt net of interest costs that are required to be capitalized during the construction period of certain capital investment projects 
other income expense  net 
other income consists of interest income earned on our temporary cash deposits and any other non operating income activity  including gains on certain short term investments and income from non consolidated investments accounted for under the equity method 
other expense consists of any non operating costs 
overview we are one of the largest steel producers and one of the largest metals recyclers in the united states based on a current estimated annual steelmaking capability of million tons and actual metals recycling shipping volumes during and of million gross tons and million gross tons of ferrous materials  respectively  and billion pounds of nonferrous metals 
our steel production during and  excluding the techs  was million tons 
the primary sources of our revenues are from the manufacture and sale of steel products  processing and sale of recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals  and to a lesser degree  fabrication and sale of steel joist and decking products 
our operations are managed and reported based on three operating segments steel operations  metals recycling and ferrous resources operations  and steel fabrication operations 
during  we had net sales of billion  gross profit of million  and operating income of million  as compared to net sales of billion  gross profit of million  and operating income of million during  and net sales of billion  gross profit of million and operating income of million during net income attributable to steel dynamics  inc was million  or per diluted share in  compared with million  or per diluted share in  and million  or per diluted share in during  operating income declined or million as compared to the majority of the decline related to steel operations  as operating income for the segment declined million  or year over year 
the combination of global economic and political uncertainty continued to suppress consumer confidence  and dampened global steel demand 
downward pressure on steel margins arose from a weak us economy  resulting in higher raw materials costs on a relative basis to lower selling values  caused in part by increased import activity 
while overall steel volumes remained steady  as demand from automotive and manufacturing stayed strong throughout the year  and steel conversion costs stayed fairly steady to down  metal spread which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of ferrous scrap our primary raw material compressed 
average steel prices per ton shipped externally declined  while average ferrous scrap consumed for production only declined per ton 
operating income of our metals recycling and ferrous resources segment decreased in to a loss of million as compared to income of million in at omnisource  our metals recycling operations within our metals recycling and ferrous resources segment  ferrous and nonferrous metals sales volume and pricing decreased as demand weakened compared to in conjunction with moderate decreases in domestic and international steel mill utilization rates  and metal spreads compressed 
this resulted in margin compression in both ferrous and nonferrous metals that resulted in operating profit at omnisource decreasing million  or  to million from that of

steel operations steel operations 
steel operations consist of our five electric arc furnace mini mills  producing steel from steel scrap  utilizing continuous casting  automated rolling mills  and various downstream finishing facilities  including the techs operations 
collectively  our steel operations sell directly to end users and service centers 
these products are used in numerous industry sectors  including the automotive  construction  commercial  transportation  agriculture  and industrial machinery markets

our flat roll division sells a broad range of sheet steel products  such as hot rolled  cold rolled and coated steel products  including a large variety of specialty products such as light gauge hot rolled  galvanized  galvalume and painted products 
the techs operations  comprised of three galvanizing lines  also sells specialized galvanized sheet steels used in non automotive applications 
sheet products represented of our steel segment shipped tons in  as compared to in  and in long products 
our structural and rail division sells structural steel beams and pilings and is also designed to produce and sell a variety of standard and premium grade rail for the railroad industry 
our engineered bar products division primarily sells special bar quality and merchant bar quality rounds and round cornered squares 
our roanoke bar division sells billets and merchant steel products  including angles  plain rounds  flats and channels 
steel of west virginia primarily sells merchant beams  channels and specialty structural steel sections 
net sales for the steel segment decreased in by million  or  compared to while selling volumes for our steel products were basically flat overall in compared to  there was a shift in mix to long products from sheet products 
sheet product shipments decreased in compared to  while long products increased 
shipments in at our structural and rail division increased  including a increase in standard rail shipments compared to to  tons in  as compared to  tons in although the non residential construction market continued to remain slow  we saw some improvement in sales and order entry at our structural and rail division in  as compared to residential construction has also clearly improved domestically  which is positive for the nonresidential construction industry  as it is a leading indicator for the sector 
we continue to realize market share gains in rail  and plan to further expand standard rail shipments in sales volume at our engineered bar division decreased in versus those in while the automotive and manufacturing sectors remained strong  transportation and heavy equipment softened as over exuberant build rates early in resulted in oversupply 
even though end markets remain mixed  we believe there is additional momentum that could be seen in related to both the automotive and manufacturing

metals recycling and ferrous resources operations metals recycling and ferrous resources operations 
this operating segment primarily includes our metals recycling operations omnisource  our liquid pig iron production facility  iron dynamics idi  and our minnesota iron operations 
our metals recycling and ferrous resources operations segment accounted for   and of our external net sales in   and  respectively

our metals recycling operations  omnisource  represent our metals sourcing and processing operations and are the most significant source of revenues and earnings in this segment 
these operations sell ferrous metals to steel mills and foundries  and nonferrous metals  such as copper  brass  aluminum and stainless steel to  among others  ingot manufacturers  copper refineries and mills  smelters  and specialty mills

nonferrous selling volumes and metal spreads decreased slightly in versus those in ferrous resources 
our ferrous resource operations consist of our two ironmaking initiatives iron dynamics idi  a liquid pig iron production facility  and our minnesota iron operations  consisting of an iron nugget production facility and planned operations to supply the nugget facility with its primary raw material  iron concentrate 
idi primarily produces liquid pig iron  which is used as a scrap substitute raw material input exclusively at our flat roll division 
our minnesota iron operations consists of mesabi nugget  owned by us  our planned future iron mining operations which is currently in the permitting process  mesabi mining  and  our iron tailings operations  mining resources owned by us 
the construction of the mesabi nugget facility was completed in  and initial production of iron nuggets commenced january since that time  we have continued to refine this pioneering production process and changed equipment configurations to increase production  improve quality  and increase plant availability 
a planned six week outage in the fall of was used to complete the groundwork necessary for the implementation of further improvements expected to be made in the first half of these modifications are expected to improve both volume and product quality 
the facility designed annual production capacity is  metric tons 
in  and  mesabi nugget produced and shipped   and  metric tons of iron nuggets  respectively  for use by our own steel mills 
our iron tailings operation  mining resources  started operations in the fourth quarter of and expects to be at full capacity during the first half of this operation provides iron ore tailings to be concentrated for use by mesabi nugget as low cost iron concentrate in the nugget production process 
this is critical to our minnesota operations as we will now be able to benefit from iron concentrate costing of less than per metric ton  compared to market pricing  which is currently in excess of per metric ton 
we expect to see this benefit beginning in the second quarter of losses from our minnesota iron operations reduced our net income in and by approximately million and million  respectively  compared to approximately million in when the location commissioned initial start up 
the increased losses in were due to the continued start up efforts and decreased market selling prices in  as pig iron market prices price index used to determine selling prices decreased 
in addition our idi operation operating income decreased million  or  compared to  due to decreased selling prices  as pig iron market prices price index used to determine selling prices decreased 
steel fabrication operations our steel fabrication operations represent the company new millennium building systems plants located throughout the united states and northern mexico 
revenues from these plants are generated from the fabrication of trusses  girders  steel joists and steel decking used within the non residential construction industry 
steel fabrication operations accounted for   and of our external net sales during   and  respectively 
the operating income for the segment was million in  compared to a loss of million in  and a loss of million in excluding a million impairment charge 

table of contents net sales for the segment increased by million  or  in compared to  as our selling volumes increased to  tons in  and our average steel fabrication operations selling price per ton shipped decreased  or  in as compared to our volume growth can be attributed to some modest growth within the non residential construction market as a whole  our organic gains in market share  as well as our expansion into the south and southwest during residential construction has also clearly improved domestically  which is positive for the nonresidential construction industry  as it is a leading indicator for the sector 
the architectural billings index has remained above the threshold for the last five consecutive months in a positive indicator for future building activity 
we are well positioned to grow with our expanded national footprint as we anticipate continuing to develop our market presence and penetration in the western portion of the united states  and further leverage improvements in the productivity and efficiency we realized in the purchase of various steel products is the largest single cost of goods sold item for our steel fabrication operations 
during   and  the cost of steel products purchased represented of the total cost of manufacturing for our steel fabrication operations  while the cost of steel decreased in  as compared to  by per ton

during each of and  selling  general and administrative expenses represented approximately of net sales 
the decrease in sg a expenses in compared to relates primarily to decreased profit sharing and incentive compensation expenses  which together were million more in than in  in conjunction with our higher profitability during amortization of intangible assets decreased million  or  during compared to due to the accelerated amortization methods used for intangible assets related to customer and scrap generator relationships 
impairment charges 
in the third quarter of  we determined that we would terminate two small joint venture entities  which were not aligned with our long term strategic focus 
the decision to terminate these joint ventures triggered an assessment for impairment based on estimated realizable 
table of contents values  resulting in an impairment charge of million being recorded 
as these joint ventures are not reported within any of our reportable segments  reported segment results are not affected 
interest expense  net of capitalized interest 
during  gross interest expense decreased million  or  to million  and capitalized interest decreased  or  to million  as compared to gross interest expense decreased in as a result of our paying down million in long term debt primarily in the third quarter of in conjunction with a refinancing of our long term debt during  which also served to reduce our overall cost of debt and extend our overall maturity schedule 
other income expense  net 
other expense  net was million during  as compared to income of million during  with interest income of million in versus million in the refinancing activity during resulted in the company recording expenses of million related to tender and call premiums  write off of unamortized debt issuance costs  loss on early extinguishment of debt  and tender expenses  which are reflected in other expenses in income taxes 
during  our income tax expense was million  as compared to million during our effective income tax rate before noncontrolling interests was and  during and  respectively 
the lower effective income tax rate in is due primarily to the impact of reductions in our unrecognized tax positions due to tax audit settlements in  which reduced our effective tax rate by 
this benefit was partially offset by an increase of the negative impact on the effective tax rate of larger noncontrolling interest losses on the lower pretax income 
included in the million balance of unrecognized tax benefits at december  are potential benefits of million that  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate 
in addition to the unrecognized tax benefits  we had million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at december  we recognize interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies on a net of tax basis in income tax expense 
during  we recognized benefits from the reduction of interest expense of million  net of tax  and benefits from the reduction of penalties of  we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction as well as income tax returns in various state jurisdictions 
the internal revenue service irs has completed its examinations of the years through and has effectively settled those years with the company 
the irs is currently examining our federal income tax returns for the years and at this time we do not believe there will be any significant examination adjustments that would result in a material change to our financial position or results of operations 
it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could change in the next twelve months as a result of these state and federal income tax audits 
based on the current audits in process  the payment of taxes as a result of audit settlements could be in an amount from zero to million by the end of with few exceptions  we are no longer subject to federal  state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years ended before consolidated results vs 
during  we had net sales of billion  gross profit of million  and operating income of million  as compared to net sales of billion  gross profit of million and operating income of million during net income attributable to steel dynamics  inc was million  or per diluted share in  compared with million  or per diluted share in during  as the domestic economy continued to show signs of improvement  we experienced further increased sales volumes and pricing  resulting in increased gross profit across all reporting segments in comparison to steel operations experienced overall improved customer order volume 
table of contents and pricing with the most impactful demand improvements in  as in  in our sheet and special bar quality steel products as the automotive  transportation  industrial  and agricultural and construction equipment markets continued to strengthen 
steel operations shipping volumes improved and overall steel pricing increased on a per ton basis  resulting in operating profit from steel operations increasing over that of by to million 
operating income of our metals recycling ferrous resources segment increased in to million as compared to million in at omnisource ferrous and nonferrous metals sales volume and pricing increased as demand continued to improve in in conjunction with increases in domestic and international steel mill utilization rates  and other production increases 
however  there was margin percentage compression in both ferrous and nonferrous metals that offset much of the sales volume and pricing gains  resulting in operating profit at omnisource increasing slightly in compared to selling  general and administrative expense sg a 
selling  general and administrative expenses including profit sharing and amortization of intangible assets were million during  as compared to million during  an increase of million  or 
during and  selling  general and administrative expenses represented approximately and of net sales  respectively 
the percentage decrease is primarily a result of increased net sales in compared with the prior year as measured against certain fixed cost components in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the increase in sg a expenses in compared to relates primarily to increased profit sharing expenses and incentive compensation  which together were million more in than in  in conjunction with company increased profitability during amortization of intangible assets decreased million  or  during compared to due to the accelerated amortization methods used for intangible assets related to customer and scrap generator relationships 
interest expense  net of capitalized interest 
during  gross interest expense increased million  or  to million  and capitalized interest decreased million  or  to million  as compared to the interest capitalization that occurred during these periods resulted from the interest required to be capitalized with respect to construction activities at our various operating segments  which were not as significant in other income expense  net 
other income  net was million during  as compared to million during  with interest income of million in versus million in income taxes 
during  our income tax expense was million  as compared to million during our effective income tax rate before noncontrolling interests was and  during and  respectively 
the lower effective income tax rate in is due primarily to additional permanent deductible items in and a reduction of the negative impact of noncontrolling interest losses due to the higher income 
liquidity and capital resources our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for  among other things  the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our steelmaking and finishing operations  and metals recycling and ferrous resources operations  and to remain in compliance with environmental laws 
our short term and long term liquidity needs arise primarily from capital expenditures  working capital requirements  principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness  and dividends 

table of contents we have met these liquidity requirements with cash provided by operations  issuances of common stock  and long term borrowings 
our availability at december  is as follows cash and equivalents short term commercial paper revolver availability total availability working capital 
cash flow from operations of million was driven mainly by net income plus non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  deferred taxes and equity based compensation 
during  our operational working capital position  representing amounts invested in trade receivables and inventories  less current liabilities other than income taxes payable and debt  increased million to billion compared to december  trade receivables  of which over were current or less than days past due  decreased million  or  during to million 
our largest customer is an affiliated company  heidtman steel  which represented of our outstanding trade receivables at december   and at december  trade receivables decreased during due to decreased sales from lower sales levels late in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of  and days sales outstanding has decreased slightly 
total inventories increased in by million  or less than  to billion at december  scrap inventory decreased million in total in as decreases in ferrous scrap volume and cost were largely offset by increases in nonferrous volume and cost  most notably copper 
work in process and finished goods inventories decreased million  with steel volumes relatively unchanged 
our trade payables decreased million  or  and general accruals decreased million during the decrease in trade payables is a reflection of the decreased production activities and commodity raw material pricing and purchasing prior to december   compared to that at december  the decrease in general accruals is due primarily to the decreases in accrued profit sharing and incentive compensation due to the decreased profitability during when compared to capital investments 
during  we invested million in property  plant and equipment  of which million was within our steel operations and million related to our metals recycling and ferrous resource operations which included million related to the construction of mining resources  which started up operations late in we believe these capital investments will benefit our net sales and related cash flows as each project reaches completion and attains appropriate operational metrics 
our current estimated cash allocation plan includes the investment of between and million in capital expenditures in our existing and announced operations 
capital resources and long term debt 
during  our total outstanding debt decreased million to billion 
our total long term debt to capitalization ratio  representing our long term debt  including current maturities  divided by the sum of our long term debt  redeemable noncontrolling interest  and total stockholders equity  was at december   as compared to at december  on january   we expanded our senior secured credit facility by adding a million term loan that matures on september  term loan 
we used the net proceeds of the term loan  together with available cash  to fund the january purchase pursuant to a tender offer of million plus accrued interest of our senior notes due on august   we issued million of senior notes due senior notes and million of senior notes due senior notes 
a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the and senior notes were used to fund the august  purchase of another million plus accrued interest of our senior notes due pursuant to a tender offer 
a further portion of these proceeds were used to fund the august  purchase pursuant to a tender offer 
table of contents of million plus accrued interest of our senior notes due  and the august  redemption of the then remaining million plus accrued interest outstanding senior notes due the remaining proceeds from the issuance of the and senior notes along with available cash were used for the september  extinguishment of the then remaining million plus accrued interest through the november  maturity date outstanding senior notes due at the conclusion of this refinancing activity  all million of the senior notes due were paid off  as was all million of the senior notes due  and new debt was issued in the form of the million term loan due  the million senior notes due  and the million senior notes due as a result of the refinancing activity  overall outstanding long term debt was reduced by million  our long term debt maturity profile was extended  and the overall cost of debt was reduced 
the refinancing activity during resulted in us recording expenses of million related to tender and call premiums  write off of unamortized debt issuance costs  loss on early extinguishment of debt  and tender expenses  which are reflected in other expenses in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  we have a senior secured credit facility facility that matures in september which provides for a billion revolver revolver 
subject to certain conditions  we have the opportunity to increase the revolver capacity by an additional million 
as noted above  the facility was expanded in january by adding a million term loan 
the facility is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and is secured by substantially all of our accounts receivable and inventories and pledges of shares of our wholly owned subsidiaries capital stock 
the revolver is available to fund working capital  capital expenditures  and other general corporate purposes 
the outstanding balance on the revolver must be the lesser of billion less other applicable commitments such as letters of credit and other secured debt  as defined within the facility or the sum of of our eligible accounts receivable and of our eligible inventories  less other applicable commitments 
at december   we had billion of availability on the revolver  million of outstanding letters of credit and other obligations which reduce availability  and there were no borrowings outstanding 
the facility contains financial covenants and other covenants that limit or restrict our ability to make capital expenditures  incur indebtedness  permit liens on property  enter into transactions with affiliates  make restricted payments or investments  enter into mergers  acquisitions or consolidations  conduct asset sales  pay dividends or distributions and enter into other specified transactions and activities 
our ability to borrow funds within the terms of the revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial and other covenants 
the financial covenants under our facility state that we must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 
our interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing our last twelve trailing months ltm consolidated adjusted ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  and certain other non cash transactions as allowed in our facility by our ltm gross interest expense  less amortization of financing fees 
in addition  a net debt as defined in the facility to consolidated ltm adjusted ebitda ratio leverage ratio of not more than must be maintained 
if the net debt to ebitda ratio exceeds at any time  our ability to make restricted payments as defined in the credit agreement which includes cash dividends to stockholders and share purchases  among other things  is limited 
at december   our interest coverage ratio and net debt leverage ratio were and  respectively 
we were therefore in compliance with these covenants at december   and we anticipate we will remain in compliance during 
table of contents cash dividends 
we declared cash dividends of million  or per common share per common share each quarter  during and million  or per common share per common share per quarter  during we paid cash dividends of million and million during and  respectively 
our board of directors  along with executive management  approves the payment of dividends on a quarterly basis 
the determination to pay cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors  after taking into account various factors  including our financial condition  results of operations  outstanding indebtedness  current and anticipated cash needs and growth plans 
in addition  the terms of our senior secured revolving credit agreement and the indentures relating to our senior notes restrict the amount of cash dividends we can pay 
other 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which  in turn  will depend upon general economic  financial and business conditions  along with competition  legislation and regulatory factors that are largely beyond our control 
in addition  we cannot assure you that our operating results  cash flow  access to credit markets and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future 
we believe that  based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth  cash flow from operations  together with other available sources of funds  including additional borrowings under our senior secured credit facility through its term  which expires in september  will be adequate for the next twelve months for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness  funding working capital requirements  and anticipated capital expenditures 
during  we received benefits from state and local governments in the form of real estate and personal property tax abatements and credits of approximately million 
based on our current abatements and incentive credits  and utilizing our existing long lived asset structure  we estimate the remaining annual benefit to our future operations to be approximately million  million  million  million  and  during the years through  respectively  and  in total thereafter 
contractual obligations and other long term liabilities we have the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations  including purchase obligations  as defined by the us securities and exchange commission 
a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
other long term liabilities are defined as long term liabilities that are reflected on our balance sheet under generally accepted accounting principles 
based on this definition  the following table includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations 
it does not include normal purchases  which are made in the 
table of contents ordinary course of business 
the following table provides aggregated information about outstanding contractual obligations and other long term liabilities as of december  in thousands payments due by period total after long term debt estimated interest payments on debt purchase obligations construction commitments lease commitments other commitments total the long term debt payment information presented above assumes that our term loan  senior notes and convertible senior notes remain outstanding until maturity 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding these transactions  and our long term debt

purchase obligations include commitments we have for the purchase of electricity  fuel  iron concentrate  natural gas and its transportation  and zinc 
these arrangements have take or pay or other similar commitment provisions 
we have utilized such take or pay requirements during the past three years under these contracts 
construction commitments relate to firm contracts we have with various vendors for the completion of certain construction projects at our various divisions at december  other commitments principally relate to certain pension and deferred compensation plan obligations 
we expect to make cash outlays in the future related to our unrecognized tax benefits  however  due to the uncertainty of the timing  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates regarding the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
accordingly  unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of million as of december   have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information 

table of contents other matters inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 
environmental and other contingencies we have incurred  and in the future will continue to incur  capital expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental control  remediation  monitoring and compliance 
during  we incurred costs related to the monitoring and compliance of environmental matters in the amount of approximately million and capital expenditures related to environmental compliance of approximately  over of the costs incurred during for monitoring and compliance were related to the normal transportation of certain types of waste produced in the steelmaking process in accordance with legal requirements 
we incurred combined environmental remediation costs of approximately  at all of our facilities during we have an accrual of million net of  of escrowed funds recorded for environmental remediation related to our metals recycling operations and million related to minnesota operations 
we believe  apart from our dependence on environmental construction and operating permits for our existing and proposed manufacturing facilities  that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  however  environmental laws and regulations have changed rapidly in recent years  and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future  such as the impact of united states government or various governmental agencies introducing regulatory changes in response to the potential of climate change 
critical accounting policies and estimates management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts 
except for our steel fabrication operations segment  we recognize revenues from sales and the allowance for estimated returns from these sales when the title of the product transfers 
provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on historical experience 
if the historical data used in our estimates does not reflect future returns and claims trends  additional provision may be necessary 
our steel fabrication operations segment recognizes revenues from construction contracts using a percentage of completion methodology based on steel tons used on completed units to date as a percentage of estimated total steel tons required by each contract 
steel fabrication operations accounted for   and of our net sales in   and  respectively 
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by our customers  which in steel operations are principally intermediate steel processors and service centers that sell our products to 
table of contents numerous industry sectors  including the automotive  agriculture  construction  commercial  transportation and industrial machinery markets 
our metals recycling operations sell ferrous metals to steel mills and foundries  and nonferrous metals  such as copper  brass  aluminum and stainless steel to  among others  ingot manufacturers  copper refineries and mills  smelters  and specialty mills 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments based on known credit risks  historical loss experience and current economic conditions affecting our customers 
we mitigate our exposure to credit risk by performing ongoing credit evaluations and taking further action when necessary  such as requiring letters of credit or other security interests to support the receivable from our customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in the impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowance may be required 
inventories 
we record inventories at lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using a weighted average cost method for scrap  and on a first in  first out  basis for other inventory 
we record amounts required  if any  to reduce the carrying value of inventory to its net realizable value as a charge to cost of goods sold 
if steel selling prices were to decline in future periods  write down of inventory could result  specifically raw material inventory such as scrap purchased during periods of peak market pricing 
impairments of long lived tangible and finite lived intangible assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
impairment losses are recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount 
we consider various factors and determine whether an impairment test is necessary  including by way of examples  a significant and prolonged deterioration in operating results and projected cash flows  significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  technological advances with respect to assets which would potentially render them obsolete  our strategy and capital planning  and the economic climate in markets to be served 
when determining future cash flows and if necessary  fair value  we must make judgments as to the expected utilization of assets and estimated future cash flows related to those assets 
we consider historical and anticipated future results  general economic and market conditions  the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the estimates are made 
those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove appropriate 
in the third quarter of  we determined that we would terminate two small joint venture entities  which were not aligned with our long term strategic focus 
the decision to terminate these joint ventures triggered an assessment for impairment based on estimated realizable values  resulting in an impairment charge of million being recorded 
as these joint ventures are not reported within any of our reportable segments  reported segment results are not affected 
after the purchase of additional fabrication assets in the fourth quarter of and determining the future use of existing fabrication facilities  the company determined that the carrying value of certain fixed assets at its idled south carolina fabrication facility exceeded their fair value as determined utilizing market and cost approaches 
the resulting impairment charge of million was recorded within the steel fabrications reporting segment in 
table of contents goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
our goodwill relates to various business combinations  and is allocated to the following reporting units at december in thousands omnisource metals recycling ferrous resources segment the techs steel segment roanoke bar division steel segment new millennium building systems steel fabrication segment at least once annually or when indicators of impairment exist  we perform an impairment test for goodwill 
goodwill is allocated to various reporting units  which are generally one level below our operating segments 
we utilize a two stepped approach to measuring goodwill impairment 
the first step of the test determines if there is potential goodwill impairment 
in this step we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount which includes goodwill 
the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows utilizing a risk adjusted discount rate to calculate the net present value of future cash flows income approach  and by using a market approach based upon an analysis of valuation metrics of comparable peer companies 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  we perform the second step of the test  which measures the amount of impairment loss to be recorded  if any 
in the second step  we compare the carrying amount of the goodwill to the implied fair value of the goodwill based on the net fair value of the recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
if the implied fair value is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value 
key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the discounted cash flows method income approach include a expected cash flows for the five year period following the testing date including market share  sales volumes and prices  costs to produce and estimated capital needs  b an estimated terminal value using a terminal year growth rate determined based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit  and c a discount rate based on management best estimate of the after tax weighted average cost of capital 
key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit under the market approach include the expected revenues and cash flows in the next year 
we consider historical and anticipated future results  general economic and market conditions  the impact of planned business and operational strategies and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated 
those estimates and judgments may or may not ultimately prove appropriate 
goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment  primarily due to the fact that they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and economic conditions present at the time of acquisition 
consequently  if operating results and or economic conditions deteriorate shortly after an acquisition  it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets 
a deterioration of economic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models  but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses  including  but not limited to  the estimated cost of capital and or discount rates 
additionally  we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use 
as a result  the cost of capital and or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends  regardless of whether our actual cost of capital has changed 
therefore  we may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset or assets in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are approximately equal to or greater than our previously forecasted amounts 

table of contents our other indefinite lived intangible assets relate to trademarks acquired through various business combinations and is allocated to the following reporting units at december  and in thousands omnisource metals recycling ferrous resources segment the techs steel segment at least annually or when indicators of impairment exist  we perform an impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets through the comparison of the fair value of the specific intangible asset with its carrying amount 
the fair value of the intangible asset is determined by using an estimate of future cash flows attributable to the asset and a risk adjusted discount rate to compute a net present value of future cash flows 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to the excess in carrying value 
our fourth quarter annual goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment analyses did not result in any impairment charges 
management does not believe that it is reasonably likely that our reporting units will fail step one of a goodwill impairment test in the near term 
the omnisource reporting unit fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately  however  our analysis contemplates performance improvements similar to historical levels  and certain organic growth initiatives 
the discount rate used in the analysis is a critical assumption  one in which a minor change can have a significant impact on the estimated fair value 
a more than basis point increase in the discount rate used in the omnisource analysis would not result in an impairment charge for the reporting unit 
we will continue to monitor operating results within all reporting units throughout the upcoming year in an effort to determine if events and circumstances warrant further interim impairment testing 
otherwise  all reporting units will again be subject to the required annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of changes in judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment  including expected future operating cash flows and discount rate  could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the future and could result in an impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
income taxes 
we are required to estimate our income taxes as a part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
we establish reserves to reduce some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the positions become uncertain 
we adjust these reserves  including any impact on the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited by a taxing authority and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
the tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears 
settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to interest rate changes 
our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of these rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings 
the following table represents the principal cash repayments and related weighted average interest rates by maturity date for our long term debt as of december  in thousands interest rate risk fixed rate variable rate principal average rate principal average rate expected maturity date thereafter total fair value commodity risk in the normal course of business we are exposed to the market risk and price fluctuations related to the sale of our products and to the purchase of raw materials used in our operations  such as metallic raw materials  electricity  natural gas  iron concentrate  fuel  and zinc 
our risk strategy associated with product sales has generally been to obtain competitive prices for our products and to allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand 
our risk strategy associated with the purchase of raw materials utilized within our operations has generally been to make some commitments with suppliers relating to future expected requirements for some commodities such as electricity  natural gas and its transportation  fuel  and zinc 
certain of these commitments contain provisions which require us to take or pay for specified quantities without regard to actual usage for periods of up to months for physical commodity requirements and for up to years for commodity transportation requirements 
our commitments for these arrangements with take or pay or other similar commitment provisions for the years ending december are as follows in thousands thereafter 
table of contents we utilized such take or pay requirements during the past three years under these contracts 
we believe that production requirements will be such that consumption of the products or services purchased under these commitments will occur in the normal production process 
we also purchase electricity consumed at our flat roll division pursuant to a contract which extends through december the contract designates hours annually as interruptible service and establishes an agreed fixed rate energy charge per mill kwh consumed for each year through the expiration of the agreement 
in our metals recycling operations we have certain fixed price contracts with various customers and suppliers for future delivery of nonferrous metals 
our risk strategy has been to enter into base metal financial contracts with the goal to protect the profit margin  within certain parameters  that was contemplated when we entered into the transaction with the customer or vendor 
at december   we had a cumulative unrealized gain associated with these financial contracts of million  substantially all of which have a settlement date in we believe the customer contracts associated with the financial contracts will be fully consummated
