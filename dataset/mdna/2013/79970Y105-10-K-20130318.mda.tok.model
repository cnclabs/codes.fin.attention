item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
business overview we are an independent exploration and production company focused on the exploration  acquisition and development of unconventional oil and natural gas resources in the eagle ford shale in south texas 
as of december   we had accumulated approximately  net leasehold acres in the oil and condensate  or black oil and volatile oil  windows of the eagle ford shale in gonzales  zavala  frio  fayette  lavaca  atascosa  webb and dewitt counties of south texas 
initial public offering on december   we completed our ipo of million shares of common stock  par value per share  at a price to the public of per share 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of the shares of common stock net of expenses and underwriting discounts and commissions 
we paid million of the net proceeds from the offering as partial consideration together with our issuance to sep i of approximately million shares of our common stock for the contribution by sep i of the limited liability company interests in sep holdings iii and approximately million of the net proceeds as partial consideration together with our issuance of  shares of our common stock for the acquisition of the limited liability company interests in marquis llc 
sep holdings iii and marquis llc each own interests in certain oil  natural gas and related assets 
distribution on june  and september   sep i distributed substantially all of the approximately million shares of our common stock that sep i owned to the partners of sep i 
the  shares of common stock distributed to sep i partners constituted of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock 
this distribution was a return on sep i partners capital contributions to sep i  thus no consideration was paid to sep i for the shares of our common stock distributed 
preferred stock offering on september   we completed a private placement of  shares of cumulative perpetual convertible preferred stock  series a  par value per share and liquidation preference of per share  or the convertible preferred stock  which were sold to a group of qualified institutional buyers pursuant to the rule a exemption from registration under the securities act 
the private placement included  shares of convertible preferred stock issued pursuant to the exercise of the initial purchasers option to cover over allotments 
the issue price of each share of the convertible preferred stock was 
we received net proceeds from the private placement of approximately million  after deducting initial purchasers discounts and commissions and offering costs payable by us of approximately million 
basis of presentation prior to distributing  of its shares of our common stock  sep i was under common control with us 
because the sep i assets were acquired from an entity under common control with us  we recorded the sep i assets retrospectively at their historical carrying values  and no goodwill or other intangible assets were recognized 
we acquired the marquis assets from parties not under common control with us  and accordingly  the marquis assets have been included in our historical 
table of contents financial statements since december  likewise  our reserve and historical operations data for periods prior to december  provided in this annual report on form k reflect only the sep i assets 
our historical financial statements as of and for the periods prior to december   the date sep i contributed the sep i assets to us  were prepared on a carve out basis from sep i accounts 
as such  they reflect the historical accounts directly attributable to the properties together with allocations of costs and expenses 
sog is a private oil and gas company engaged in the exploration for and development of oil and natural gas 
sog has historically acted as the operator of a significant portion of sep i oil and natural gas properties 
sog provided all employee  management  and administrative support to sep i and  for periods prior to december   a proportionate share of sog general and administrative costs were allocated to the sep i assets 
the costs of these services associated with the sep i assets were allocated to the sep i assets primarily based on the ratio of capital expenditures between the entities to which sog provides services and the sep i assets 
however  other factors  such as time spent on general management services and producing property activities  were also considered in the allocation of these costs 
management believes such allocations were reasonable  however  they may not be indicative of the actual expense that would have been incurred had the sep i assets been operated as an independent company for periods prior to december  on december   sog began providing similar types of services to the company under the services agreement as described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our properties our eagle ford shale acreage is comprised of approximately  net acres in gonzales county  texas  which we refer to as our palmetto area  approximately  net acres in zavala and frio counties  texas  which we refer to as our maverick area  and approximately  net acres in fayette  lavaca  atascosa  webb and dewitt counties  texas  which we refer to as our marquis area 
we own all rights and depths on the majority of our eagle ford shale acreage 
we believe this acreage to be prospective for other zones  including the buda limestone  austin chalk and pearsall shale formations that lie above and below the eagle ford shale 
we are currently evaluating these other zones  which may present us with additional drilling locations 
several of our existing wells are either producing from or have logged pay in the buda limestone and the austin chalk formations 
in addition  we have approximately  net acres in the haynesville shale in natchitoches parish  louisiana  which are operated by chesapeake energy corporation 
we do not currently anticipate spending any capital on our haynesville acreage in the near future 
the majority of our haynesville leases are held by production  giving us and our partners the option to accelerate drilling should natural gas prices increase 
finally  we have amassed approximately  net acres in northern montana  which we believe may be prospective for the heath  three forks and bakken shales 
our lease terms in northern montana are for five years with an option in to renew for another five years at per acre  giving us time to allow the industry activity to develop the trend before we devote significant drilling capital to our acreage position 
we are continuously evaluating opportunities to grow both our acreage and our producing assets through acquisitions 
our successful acquisition of such assets will depend on both the opportunities and the financing alternatives available to us at the time we consider such opportunities 

table of contents recent developments on march   we executed a definitive agreement to purchase assets in the eagle ford shale in south texas from hess for approximately million in cash  subject to customary adjustments 
the effective date of the transaction is march  with an expected closing date in the second quarter 
the proposed acquisition includes based on the company internal estimates estimated proved reserves  as of the effective date  of mmboe  oil and natural gas 
proved developed reserves are estimated to account for approximately of the total proved reserves 
as of the effective date  the properties to be acquired consisted of approximately  net acres in dimmit  frio  lasalle and zavala counties of south texas with gross wells currently producing approximately  boe d 
in connection with the acquisition we have secured commitments for million in debt financing and expect to access the capital markets in the near term  subject to market conditions and other factors 
closing of the acquisition and availability of the debt financing are expected to occur concurrently in the second quarter of this year and will be subject to the satisfaction of various customary closing conditions 
outlook beginning in the second half of  the united states and other industrialized countries experienced a significant economic slowdown  which led to a substantial decline in worldwide energy demand 
during this same period  north american natural gas supply was increasing as a result of the rise in domestic unconventional natural gas production 
the combination of lower energy demand due to the economic slowdown and higher north american natural gas supply resulted in significant declines in oil  ngls and natural gas prices 
while oil and ngl prices started to steadily increase beginning in the second quarter of  natural gas prices remained depressed  recently hitting a year low  due to a continued increase in natural gas supply and weak offsetting demand growth 
the outlook for a worldwide economic recovery in remains uncertain  and the timing of a recovery in worldwide demand for energy is difficult to predict 
as a result  it is likely that commodity prices will continue to be volatile during sustained periods of low prices for oil or natural gas could materially and adversely affect our financial position  our results of operations  the quantities of oil and natural gas reserves that we can economically produce  the price of our common stock and our access to capital 
significant factors that may impact future commodity prices include the political and economic developments currently impacting iran  egypt  libya and the middle east in general  the extent to which members of the opec and other oil exporting nations are able to continue to manage oil supply through export quotas  the impact of sovereign debt issues in europe  and overall north american oil and natural gas supply and demand fundamentals 
although we cannot predict the occurrence of events that will affect future commodity prices or the degree to which these prices will be affected  the prices for any oil  natural gas or ngls that we produce will generally approximate market prices in the geographic region of the production 
as an oil and natural gas company  we face the challenge of natural production declines 
as initial reservoir pressures are depleted  oil and natural gas production from a given well or formation decreases 
our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to add estimated reserves in excess of our production 
accordingly  we plan to maintain our focus on adding reserves through acquisitions and development projects and improving the economics of producing oil and natural gas from our properties 
we expect these acquisition opportunities may come from members of the sanchez group  as well as from unrelated third parties 
our ability to add estimated reserves through acquisitions and development projects is dependent on many factors  including our ability to raise capital  obtain regulatory approvals and procure contract drilling rigs and personnel

net production 
production increased from mboe in to mboe in due to our drilling program 
the number of gross wells producing at year end and the production for the periods were as follows year ended december  wells mboe wells mboe wells mboe palmetto maverick marquis other total in  of our production was oil and was natural gas compared to production that was oil and natural gas 
in  of our production was oil and was natural gas 
average sales price 
our average realized oil price for the year ended december  increased to per bo as compared to per bo and per bo for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the average price realized for our natural gas production in was per mcf  lower than the average sales price in of per mcf and lower than the average sales price in of per mcf 

table of contents revenues 
oil and natural gas sales revenues totaled approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
oil sales revenue for the year ended december  increased million with million attributable to the increase in production and million due to the higher average sales price compared to for the year ended december  compared to  oil sales revenue increased million with million attributable to the increase in production and million due to the higher average sales price

oil and natural gas production expenses 
oil and natural gas production expenses are the costs incurred to produce our oil and natural gas  as well as the daily costs incurred to maintain our producing properties 
such costs also include field personnel costs  utilities  chemical additives  salt water disposal  maintenance  repairs and occasional well workover expenses related to our oil and natural gas properties 
our oil and natural gas production expenses increased by approximately million to approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the same period in and  for the same period in the increase in oil and natural gas production expenses from to is directly attributable to the increase in production resulting from our increased drilling activities in the eagle ford shale 
production and ad valorem taxes 
production and ad valorem taxes are paid on produced oil and natural gas based upon a percentage of gross revenues or at fixed rates established by state or local taxing authorities 
our production and ad valorem taxes totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in production and ad valorem taxes over the three year period was due to both the significant increase in production volumes as well as an increase in our average realized prices for oil over the periods 

table of contents depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depletion  depreciation and amortization reflects the systematic expensing of the capitalized costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties 
we use the full cost method of accounting and accordingly  we capitalize all costs associated with the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties  including unproved and unevaluated property costs 
internal costs are capitalized only to the extent they are directly related to acquisition  exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production  selling or general corporate administrative activities 
capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties are amortized using the units of production method based upon production and estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities 
unproved and unevaluated property costs are excluded from the amortizable base used to determine depletion  depreciation and amortization expense 
our depletion  depreciation and amortization expenses increased from million in and million in to million for the year ended december  due to increases in production and significant development costs incurred 
general and administrative expenses 
our g a expenses  including stock based compensation  totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the same periods in and  respectively 
g a expenses  excluding stock based compensation expense  totaled million for  an increase of over the comparable period 
this increase was due to higher costs associated with the new public entity  consisting primarily of audit fees  legal expenses  investor relation costs  consulting and insurance 
for the year ended december   we recorded a non cash stock based compensation expense of approximately million primarily related to the rescission and cancellation of million shares of restricted stock during the second quarter of the restricted stock awards were granted to non employees such that upon rescission and cancellation  stock based compensation expense was based on the fair value at the date of cancellation  and the associated unrecognized compensation expense was accelerated and recognized as stock based compensation expense 
at the date of cancellation  the fair value of the stock awards cancelled was approximately million  or per restricted share 
commodity derivative transactions 
we apply mark to market accounting to our derivative contracts  therefore the full volatility of the non cash change in fair value of our outstanding contracts is reflected in other income and expense 
during the year ended december   we recognized a million unrealized loss on our commodity derivative contracts related to the change in fair value of our derivative contracts and a million realized loss associated with settlements and or expirations on our commodity derivative contracts 
during the year ended december   we recognized a million unrealized loss related to the change in fair value of our derivative contracts 
because our outstanding contracts during related to production  no settlements were recognized during we had no derivative instruments during income tax expense 
the properties contributed by sep i were historically owned by a limited partnership that is not a taxable entity and is a disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes 
their taxable income or loss  which may vary substantially from the net income or loss reported in the consolidated statements of operations  was allocated to the limited and general partners of sep i 
with the transfer of the sep i assets to us  the sep i assets operations are now subject to federal and state income taxes 
at the date of acquisition  we estimated that the aggregate net tax basis of the sep i assets exceeded the aggregate net book basis by million  resulting in a deferred tax asset of million  which was fully offset by a valuation allowance 
effective december   we began accounting for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount more likely than not to be recovered 
we believe that after considering all the available evidence  both 
table of contents positive and negative  historical and prospective  with greater weight given to historical evidence  there is insufficient evidence to determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized and therefore we have established a full valuation allowance to reduce the net deferred tax assets to zero at december  and we will continue to assess the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets considering all available information obtained in future reporting periods 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately million in cash  million invested in available for sale securities and no indebtedness 
on november   we and our subsidiaries  sep holdings iii and marquis llc collectively referred to with us as the borrowers  entered into a credit agreement  or the first lien credit agreement  dated as of november   among the borrowers  as borrowers  capital one  national association  as administrative agent  sole lead arranger and sole book runner  and each of the other lenders party thereto 
the first lien credit agreement provides for a million revolving credit facility which matures november  and is secured by a senior lien on substantially all of the assets of the borrowers 
availability under the first lien credit agreement is at all times subject to customary conditions and the then applicable borrowing base  which was initially million and subject to periodic redeterminations 
also on november   we entered into a credit agreement  or the second lien credit agreement collectively referred to with the first lien credit agreement as the credit agreements  dated as of november   among the borrowers  as borrowers  macquarie bank limited  as administrative agent  sole lead arranger and sole book runner  and the other lenders party thereto 
the second lien credit agreement provides for a million term loan facility which matures may  and is secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of the borrowers that is junior to those liens under the first lien credit agreement 
the second lien credit agreement provides for an initial commitment of million  subject to customary conditions  with the remaining commitments subject to the approval of the lenders and other customary conditions 
as of december   we had not made any draws under either credit agreement  but we intend to use any future borrowings to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes 
under the terms of the second lien credit agreement  the lenders million commitment would have expired on january  unless drawn by such date 
we drew the available million on january  leaving us with million of outstanding debt 
there is no usage under our revolving credit facility 
on february   our available borrowing base under our first lien credit agreement was increased from million to million 
our second lien credit agreement remained unchanged 
in connection with the recently announced agreement to purchase assets from hess  we secured commitments for million in debt financing and expect to access the capital markets in the near term  subject to market conditions and other factors 
availability of the debt financing is conditioned upon  and is intended to be available concurrently with  the closing of the hess acquisition and will be subject to the satisfaction of various customary closing conditions 
we expect to use our cash on hand  our internally generated cash flow from operations  the proceeds from potential debt and or equity issuances and or borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our planned capital expenditure through the end of our capital expenditure program is anticipated to total approximately million  including approximately million for drilling and completion activities 
we plan to drill and complete approximately gross net wells in approximately million is estimated for facilities  new leases and seismic data 

table of contents cash flows our cash flows for the years ended december   and are as follows in thousands year ended december  cash flow data net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by used in operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities in was approximately million compared to a million in and use of funds in of million 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in and was due primarily to higher revenue resulting from an increase in production as well as higher average oil sales prices as compared to the respective prior year period 
net cash used in investing activities 
net cash flows used in investing activities totaled approximately million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the same period in for the year ended december   capital expenditures for leasehold and drilling activities totaled million  primarily associated with the drilling of wells 
in addition we invested million in available for sale securities 
in  we acquired the marquis assets which used cash of million and incurred capital expenditures for leasehold and drilling activities of million 
this was partially offset by million in proceeds from the sale of certain non core undeveloped leases 
for the year ended december   we incurred capital expenditures for leasehold and drilling activities of million  partially offset by million in proceeds from the sale of certain non core undeveloped leases 
net cash provided by financing activities 
net cash flows provided by financing activities totaled million for the year ended december  due primarily to net proceeds from our private placement of convertible preferred stock of approximately million  after deducting the initial purchasers discounts and commissions and offering costs payable by us of approximately million 
these net proceeds were partially offset by financing costs associated with our new credit facilities of million and preferred dividends paid of million 
for the year ended december   net cash flows provided by financing activities totaled million due primarily to our ipo 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of the shares of common stock net of expenses and underwriting discounts and commissions 
with proceeds from the ipo  we paid sep i million and paid for the acquisition of the marquis assets 
partially offsetting these payments were contributions by sep i of million related to the operation of the oil and natural gas properties prior to our acquisition of the sep i assets 
for the year ended december   all of our cash provided by financing activities resulted from capital contributions 
commitments and contractual obligations as of december   we had no material contractual obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements currently  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
see note basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form k 
when we prepare our financial statements  we review our estimates  including those related to oil  ngl and natural gas revenues  oil and natural gas properties  oil  ngl and natural gas reserves  fair value of derivative instruments  abandonment liabilities  income taxes  commitments and contingencies  depreciation  depletion and amortization  and full cost ceiling calculation 
our estimates are based on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
oil and natural gas properties we use the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties 
accordingly  all costs associated with acquisition  exploration  and development of oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized 
under the full cost accounting rules  capitalized costs  less accumulated amortization and related deferred taxes  shall not exceed an amount the ceiling equal to i the present value of estimated future net revenues less future production  development  site restoration  and abandonment costs derived based on current costs assuming continuation of existing economic conditions and computed using a discount factor of ten percent  plus ii the cost of properties not being amortized  plus iii the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproven properties included in the costs being amortized  less iv the related income tax effects 
if unamortized costs capitalized within the cost pool exceed the ceiling  the excess is charged to expense and separately disclosed during the period in which the excess occurs 
amounts thus required to be written off are not reinstated for any subsequent increase in the cost center ceiling 
depreciation  depletion  and amortization is provided using the unit of production method based upon estimates of proved oil  ngl and natural gas reserves with oil  ngl and natural gas production being converted to a common unit of measure based upon their relative energy content 
investments in unproved properties and major development projects are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impairment occurs 
if the results of an assessment indicate that the properties are impaired  the amount of the impairment is added to the capitalized costs to be amortized 
once the assessment of unproved properties is complete and when major development projects are evaluated  the costs previously excluded from amortization are transferred to the full cost pool and amortization begins 
the amortizable base includes estimated future development costs and where significant  dismantlement  restoration and abandonment costs  net of estimated salvage value 
in arriving at depletion rates under the unit of production method  the quantities of recoverable oil  ngl and natural gas reserves are established based on estimates made by our geologists and engineers  which require significant judgment as does the projection of future production volumes and levels of future costs  including future development costs 
in addition  considerable judgment is necessary in determining when unproved properties become impaired and in determining the existence of proved reserves once a well has been drilled 
all of these judgments may have significant impact on the calculation of depletion and impairment expense 
sales of proved and unproved properties are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs with no gain or loss recognized  unless such 
table of contents adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved oil  ngl and natural gas reserves  in which case the gain or loss would be recognized in the statement of operations 
oil and natural gas reserves in january  the fasb issued an update to the oil and gas topic  which aligns the oil and natural gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements with the requirements in the sec final rule  modernization of the oil and gas reporting requirements  which we refer to as the final rule 
the final rule was issued on december  the final rule was developed to provide investors with a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and natural gas reserves 
the final rule permits the use of new technologies to determine proved reserve estimates if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserve volume estimates 
the final rule also allows  but does not require  companies to disclose their probable and possible reserves to investors in documents filed with the sec 
in addition  the final rule requires companies to report oil and natural gas reserves using an average price based upon the prior month period rather than a year end price 
the final rule became effective for fiscal years ending on or after december  reserves and their relation to estimated future net cash flows impact our depletion and impairment calculations 
as a result  adjustments to depletion and impairment are made concurrently with changes to reserve estimates 
the reserve estimates and the projected cash flows derived from these reserve estimates are prepared in accordance with sec guidelines 
the accuracy of our reserve estimates is a function of many factors including the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgments of the individuals preparing the estimates  all of which could deviate significantly from actual results 
as such  reserve estimates may vary materially from the ultimate quantities of oil  natural gas  and ngls eventually recovered 
asset retirement obligations we comply with asc and recognize estimated amounts for asset retirement obligations and asset retirement costs 
asc requires liability recognition for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets  such as producing well sites 
the obligations included within the scope of asc are those for which we face a legal obligation for settlement 
the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation is fair value  defined as the price that an entity would have to pay a willing third party of comparable credit standing to assume the liability in a current transaction other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
the significant unobservable inputs to this fair value measurement include estimates of plugging  abandonment  remediation costs  well life  inflation and credit adjusted risk free rate 
the inputs are calculated based on historical data as well as current estimates 
when the liability is initially recorded  we increase the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  accretion of the liability is recognized each period  and the capitalized cost is amortized over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  the obligation is either settled for its recorded amount or a gain or loss is incurred which we treat as an adjustment to the full cost pool 
the standard requires us to record a liability for the fair value of the dismantlement and abandonment costs  excluding salvage values 
revenue recognition oil  ngl and natural gas sales are recognized when production is sold to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price  delivery has occurred  title has transferred  and collectability of the revenue is probable 
delivery occurs and title is transferred when production has been delivered to a pipeline  
table of contents railcar or truck  or a tanker lifting has occurred 
the sales method of accounting is used for oil  ngl and natural gas sales such that revenues are recognized based on our share of actual proceeds from the oil  ngl and natural gas sold to purchasers 
oil and natural gas imbalances are generated on properties for which two or more owners have the right to take production in kind and  in doing so  take more or less than their respective entitled percentage 
derivative instruments at times we may utilize derivative instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the underlying commodity prices for the products sold by us 
the carrying amount of derivative assets and liabilities is reported on the balance sheet at the estimated fair value of the derivative instruments 
our management sets and implements all of our hedging policies  including volumes  types of instruments and counterparties  on a monthly basis 
these derivative transactions are not designated as cash flow hedges 
accordingly  these derivative contracts are marked to market and any changes in the estimated value of derivative contracts held at the balance sheet date are recognized in the statement of operations as realized and unrealized gains or losses on derivative contracts 
recent accounting pronouncements for recent accounting pronouncements  please see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including the effects of adverse changes in commodity prices and  potentially  interest rates as described below 
the primary objective of the following information is to provide quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil  ngl and natural gas prices and interest rates 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than speculative trading 
commodity price risk our major market risk exposure is in the pricing that we receive for our oil  ngl and natural gas production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing market prices applicable to our natural gas and oil production 
pricing for oil  ngl and natural gas has been volatile and unpredictable for several years  and this volatility is expected to continue in the future 
the prices we receive for our oil  ngl and natural gas production depend on many factors outside of our control  such as the strength of the global economy 
to reduce the impact of fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices on our revenues  or to protect the economics of property acquisitions  we periodically enter into derivative contracts with respect to a portion of our projected oil and natural gas production through various transactions that fix or  through options  modify the future prices realized 
these transactions may include price swaps whereby we will receive a fixed price for our production and pay a variable market price to the contract counterparty 
additionally  we may enter into collars  whereby we receive the excess  if any  of the fixed floor over the floating rate or pays the excess  if any  of the floating rate over the fixed ceiling price 
in addition  we enter into option transactions  such as puts or put spreads  as a way to manage our exposure to fluctuating prices 
these hedging activities are intended to support oil and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage exposure to oil and natural gas price fluctuations 
we do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative trading purposes 

table of contents as of december   we had four commodity derivative contracts in place covering a portion of our production for combined  these four contracts cover an aggregate of  bopd of oil production 
the contracts consist of a bopd wti swap for all of  a  bopd wti swap for all of  a  bopd put spread for all of where we are long a wti put and short a wti put  and a  bopd put spread for the second half of where we are long a wti put and short a wti put 
as of december   the fair value of our commodity derivative contracts was an asset of approximately million  all of which is expected to settle during the next twelve months 
a increase in the oil index price above the december  price would result in a decrease in the fair value of our commodity derivative contracts of approximately million  conversely  a decrease in the oil index price would result in an increase of approximately million 
subsequent to december   we entered into two additional oil derivative contracts covering a portion of our estimated production 
in january  we entered into a commodity derivative contract covering  bopd of oil production for all of calendar year the contract is a three way costless collar consisting of a costless collar long a wti put and short a wti call plus a put short a wti put 
in february  we entered into a commodity derivative contract covering an additional  bopd of oil production for all of calendar year the contract is a three way costless collar consisting of a costless collar long a lls put and short a lls call plus a put short a lls put 
interest rate risk we historically have not had any debt 
if we incur significant debt in the future we may enter into interest rate derivative contracts on a portion of our then outstanding debt to mitigate the risk of fluctuating interest rates 
as of december   we had not made any draws under either credit agreement 
under the terms of the second lien credit agreement  the lenders million commitment would have expired on january  unless drawn by such date 
we drew the available million on january  leaving us with million of outstanding debt 
there is currently no usage under our revolving credit facility
