table of contents revenue we generate revenue through the sale of transportation and logistics services to our clients 
revenue is recognized when the client product is delivered by a third party carrier 
our revenue was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  reflecting growth rates of and  in and  respectively  as compared to the corresponding prior year 
our revenue is generated from two different types of clients enterprise and transactional 
our enterprise accounts typically generate higher dollar amounts and volume than our transactional relationships 
we categorize a client as an enterprise client if we have a contract with the client for the provision of services on a recurring basis 
our contracts with enterprise clients typically have a multi year term and are often exclusive for a certain transportation mode or point of origin 
in several cases  we provide substantially all of a client transportation and logistics requirements 
we categorize all other clients as transactional clients 
we provide services to our transactional clients on a shipment by shipment basis 
as of december   we had enterprise clients and  for the year ended december   we served  transactional clients 
for the year ended december   we added enterprise clients 
for the years ended december   and  enterprise clients accounted for  and of our revenue  respectively  and transactional clients accounted for  and of our revenue  respectively 
we expect to continue to grow both our enterprise and transactional client base in the future  although the rate of growth for each type of client will vary depending on opportunities in the marketplace 
revenue recognized per shipment will vary depending on the transportation mode  fuel prices  shipment weight  density and mileage of the product shipped 
the primary modes of shipment that we transact in are tl  inter modal and small parcel and ltl 
other transportation modes include domestic air  expedited services and international 
typically  our revenue is lower for an ltl shipment than for a tl shipment  and revenue per shipment is higher for shipments in modes other than tl  ltl and small parcel 
material shifts in the percentage of our revenue by transportation mode could have a significant impact on our revenue growth 
in  ltl accounted for of our revenue  tl accounted for of our revenue  small parcel accounted for of our revenue  inter modal accounted for of our revenue and other transportation accounted for of our revenue 
the transportation industry has historically been subject to seasonal sales fluctuations as shipments generally are lower during and after the winter holiday season because many companies ship goods and stock inventories prior to the winter holiday season 
while we experience some seasonality  differences in our revenue between periods have been driven primarily by growth in our client base 
transportation costs and net revenue we act primarily as a service provider to add value and expertise in the procurement and execution of transportation and logistics services for our clients 
our fee structure is primarily variable  although we have entered into a limited number of fixed fee arrangements that represent an insignificant portion of our revenue 
net revenue equals revenue minus transportation costs 
our transportation costs consist primarily of the direct cost of transportation paid to the carrier 
net revenue is the primary indicator of our ability to add value to our clients and is considered by management to be an important measurement of our success in the marketplace 
our transportation costs are typically lower for an ltl shipment than for a tl shipment 
therefore  our net revenue margin is typically higher for an ltl shipment than for a tl shipment 
material shifts in the percentage of our revenue by transportation mode  including small parcel  could have a significant impact on our net revenue

the percentage of net revenue paid as commissions will vary depending on the type of client  composition of the sales team and mode of transportation 
commission expense  stated as a percentage of net revenue  could increase or decrease 
table of contents in the future depending on the composition of our revenue growth and the relative impact of changes in sales teams and service offerings 
we accrue for commission expense when we recognize the related revenue 
some of our sales personnel receive a monthly advance to provide them with a more consistent income stream 
cash paid to our sales personnel in advance of commissions earned is reflected as a prepaid expense on our balance sheet 
as our sales personnel earn commissions  a portion of their commission payment is withheld and offset against their prepaid commission balance  if any 
our selling  general and administrative expenses  which exclude commission expense  consist of compensation costs for our sales  operations  information systems  finance and administrative support employees as well as occupancy costs  professional fees and other general and administrative expenses

critical accounting policies revenue recognition in accordance with asc topic revenue and expense recognition for freight services in process  transportation revenue and related transportation costs are recognized when the shipment has been delivered by a third party carrier 
fee for service revenue is recognized when the services have been rendered 
at the time of delivery or rendering of services  as applicable  the company obligation to fulfill a transaction is complete and collection of revenue is reasonably assured 
in accordance with asc topic reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  the company generally recognizes revenue on a gross basis  as opposed to a net basis similar to a commission arrangement  because it bears the risks and benefits associated with revenue generated activities by  among other things acting as a principal in the transaction  establishing prices  managing all aspects of the shipping process  including selection of the carrier  and taking the risk of loss for collection  delivery  and returns 
certain transactions to provide specific services are recorded at the net amount charged to the client due to the following key factors a the company does not have latitude in establishing pricing  and b the company has credit risk for only the net revenue earned from its client while the carrier has credit risk for the transportation costs 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms 
invoices require payment within to days from the invoice date 
accounts receivable are stated at the amount billed to the customer 
customer account balances with invoices past due days are considered delinquent 
the company generally does not charge interest on past due amounts 

table of contents the carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts that reflects management best estimate of amounts that will not be collected 
the allowance is based on historical loss experience and any specific risks identified in client collection matters 
accounts receivable are charged off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when it is determined that the receivable is uncollectible 
goodwill and other intangibles goodwill represents the excess of consideration transferred and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
in accordance with asc topic intangibles goodwill and other testing goodwill for impairment  goodwill is not amortized  but instead is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist 
in september  the fasb approved asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other testing goodwill for impairment 
as a result  the company assessed the qualitative factors and determined no further testing was necessary 
if further testing is warranted  the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a two step impairment test at the reporting unit level 
for goodwill impairment test purposes  the company is considered one reporting unit 
in the first step  the fair value for the company is compared to its carrying value including goodwill 
in the case that the fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed that compares the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill 
the fair value for the implied goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities excluding goodwill 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value  the difference is recognized as an impairment charge 
absent any special circumstances that could require an interim test  the company has elected to test for goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of each year 
asc topic also requires that intangible assets with finite lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever impairment indicators exist in accordance with asc topic property  plant and equipment 
the company intangible assets consist of customer relationships  noncompete agreements  and trade names  which are being amortized on an accelerated basis over their estimated weighted average useful lives of years  years and years  respectively 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with asc topic compensation stock compensation which requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based upon their fair values 
share based employee compensation costs are recognized as a component of selling  general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income 
for more information related to the company stock based compensation programs  see note stock based compensation plans for a description of the company accounting for stock based compensation plans
