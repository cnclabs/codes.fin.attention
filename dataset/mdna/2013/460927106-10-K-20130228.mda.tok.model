this section presents discussion and analysis of our financial condition at december  and  and our results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december  this section should be read in conjunction with our accompanying financial statements and related footnotes in this report 
for a detailed discussion of our business  see item business in this report 
critical accounting policies overview 
the preparation of our financial statements and the information included in management s discussion and analysis is governed by policies that are based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and general practices within the banking industry 
the financial information contained in our financial statements is  to a significant extent  based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it is important to a company s results of operations and financial condition  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain amounts reported in our financial statements and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 

table of contents we believe that the estimates and assumptions used in connection with the amounts reported in our financial statements and related disclosures contained herein are reasonable and made in good faith 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that relate to the determination of the following our allowance for loan losses  our valuation allowance for real estate losses  other than temporary impairment assessments of our security investments  and the need for and amount of a valuation allowance for our deferred tax asset 
these items are considered critical accounting estimates because each is highly susceptible to change from period to period and require us to make numerous assumptions about a variety of information that directly affect the calculation of the amounts reported in our financial statements 
for example  the impact of a large unexpected chargeoff could deplete the allowance for loan losses and potentially require us to record increased loan loss provisions to replenish the allowance  which could negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 
for a summary of our other significant accounting policies  see note to the financial statements in this report 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses reflects our judgment as to the estimated credit losses that may result from defaults in our loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a loan loss provision charged to expense 
loans are charged off against the allowance when we believe that the collection of any portion of the principal amount of the loan balance is confirmed as a loss 
subsequent recoveries of previous chargeoffs are added back to the allowance 
we evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses at least quarterly or more frequently when necessary 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires us to make estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
the allowance consists of specific and general components 
for loans that are not impaired  the general component of the allowance is based on a number of factors that begin with our actual historical loss experience by major loan category expressed as a percentage of outstanding loans 
in determining our historical loss rate  we reviewed our chargeoff history over a year period 
this charge off history excludes those that arose from the may bulk sale discussed in greater detail elsewhere in this report  which comprised the sale of a large number of performing tdrs  nonaccrual loans  other performing loans and some ore at sales prices substantially below the appraised values of these assets 
the assets were sold substantially below their net carrying values as we were required to expedite the reduction of our problem assets during a time when the financial markets were volatile and real property values were depressed 
we believe the result of the bulk sale was not indicative of the ultimate losses that may have occurred had the assets been resolved on an individual basis  over time and not on a steeply discounted immediate bulk sale basis 
a transaction  such as this one  that is unusual and deemed not reflective of normal charge off history can be excluded from an historical analysis 
we have suffered all of our historical lending losses in the period from through the bulk of our loans originated from through continue to perform during what can be described as the most difficult economic time period since the great depression 
because our actual loss experience may not adequately predict the level of losses inherent in the current portfolio  we then also review other qualitative factors to determine if our historical loss rate should be increased or decreased based upon a review of those factors 
our evaluation considers the following qualitative factors 
the discussion that follows should be read in conjunction with the section lending activities in item business of this report 
i size of our loans 
our loan portfolio has many individual loans with large principal balances 
the default of a loan with a large principal balance may have a greater negative impact on our lending losses and therefore this factor increases the risk profile of our loan portfolio 
ii concentrations of our loans 
our loan portfolio is concentrated in loans secured by commercial and multifamily real estate  including some properties that are vacant or substantially vacant and vacant land  all of which are generally considered to have more credit risk than traditional family residential lending 
the properties that collateralize our loans are also concentrated in two states  new york and florida  and many are also located in geographical areas of those states that are being revitalized or redeveloped  which are negatively impacted to a greater degree in an economic downturn 
this factor increases the risk profile of our loan portfolio 

table of contents iii changes in the quality of our review of specific problem loans  including loans on nonaccrual status  and estimates of fair value of the underlying properties 
we also consider our internal procedures for monitoring loans and how they may impact our historical loss rate 
when a loan experiences payment problems  an internal review is initiated by inb s chief credit officer to re evaluate the internal credit rating that is assigned to the loan 
we also engage an independent third party to perform quarterly reviews of the entire loan portfolio  which includes all problem loans 
nonaccrual and or problem loans are normally downgraded or upgraded based on known facts and circumstances at the time of review  which includes the review of rent rolls  financial statements and strength of borrower s repayment sources and a physical inspection and a determination of the estimated fair value of the collateral property 
management also takes into consideration the nature and extent of personal guarantees and global cash flow analysis in determining credit ratings 
we estimate the fair value of the properties that collateralize our impaired loans based on a variety of information  including third party appraisals and our management s judgment of other factors 
our internal policy is to obtain externally prepared appraisals or in limited cases indications of value from licensed appraisers or local real estate brokers as follows for all impaired loans  for restructured or renewed loans  upon classification or downgrade of a loan  upon accepting a deed in lieu of foreclosure  upon transfer of a loan to foreclosed real estate  and at least annually thereafter for all of our impaired and substandard rated loans and real estate owned through foreclosure 
in addition to obtaining appraisals  we also consider the knowledge and experience of our two senior lending officers the chairman and inb s president and inb s chief credit officer related to values of properties in our geographical market areas 
these officers take into account various information  including local and national real estate market data provided by third parties  the consideration of the type  condition  location and occupancy of the specific collateral property as well as the current economic conditions and demand for the specific property in the area the property is located in assessing our internal estimates of fair value 
additionally  we require that all third party appraisals we receive be reviewed by a different external appraiser for reasonableness 
we believe the above steps help mitigate the risk profile of our loan portfolio 
iv changes in the volume of our past due loans  nonaccrual loans and adversely classified assets 
as discussed elsewhere in this report  our level of such assets has declined significantly since our special mention and substandard rated loans decreased from approximately million and million  respectively  prior to the may bulk sale  to approximately million and million  respectively  at december  the lower level of problem assets helps mitigate the risk profile of our loan portfolio 
v adverse situations which may affect our borrowers ability to repay 
nonaccrual problem loans are reviewed individually based on the facts and circumstances known to us at that time 
an assessment is made as to whether there are specific issues unique to each loan or borrower that caused the problem or whether such issues identified are generic systemic to the entire or a large portion of the loan portfolio and as such increase the risk profile of the loan portfolio 
in addition to the negative impact from the weak economy  high rates of unemployment  and increased office and retail vacancy rates  we believe that a large number of our loans that became nonaccrual over the last several years also had specific issues unique to each loan that resulted in the loan being classified as nonaccrual 
when adjusting our historical loss experience  we consider the results of the above assessments 
vi changes in national  regional and local economic and business conditions and other developments that may affect the collectability of our loan portfolio  including impacts of political  regulatory  legal and competitive changes on the portfolio 
we continually monitor real estate market and economic conditions  both locally in our lending areas and on a national level 
the monitoring process is done through the review of various publications  discussions with brokers and existing customers and analysis of market rents 
political and regulatory issues  including armed conflicts and acts of terrorism  or natural disasters such as hurricanes  may have an adverse impact on economic conditions as a whole and may be more pronounced on loans in specific geographic regions 
when adjusting our historical loss experience  we also consider the results of the above assessments 
vii changes to our lending policies and procedures  underwriting standards  risk selection loan volumes and loan terms and to our collection  loan chargeoff and recovery practices 
we continually review our lending policies  procedures and practices 
furthermore  we believe that we have become more risk averse over the last several years by being more selective in originating new loans 

table of contents additionally  we continue to enhance our loan origination and monitoring process  including the following adding more detailed policy guidelines for acceptable debt service coverage ratios based on maximum amortization periods for commercial and multifamily properties  established more detailed requirements for personal guarantees  formalized our credit approval process  revised our loan presentation format to the loan committee to clearly identity any policy exceptions  enhanced the portfolio stratification to better identify concentration risks  enhanced our tdr policy to better identify loans experiencing financial difficulties  enhanced our credit grading policy  updated our appraisal requirement policy  including accelerating the ordering of new appraisals when loans are experiencing payment difficulty  established a formal third party review process of all appraisals  established a criticized asset report committee to review and approve quarterly analyses  created penetration reports evidencing the obtaining of various types of financial or performance data  and instituted reviews and action plans on a quarterly basis for all classified loans 
we believe the above steps help mitigate the risk profile of our loan portfolio 
viii changes in the experience  ability and depth of our lending management and other relevant staff 
inb s chief credit officer  who has years of experience  reviews the assignment of credit ratings for all loans and attends all loan committee meetings and provides his input 
we have also added to and expect to continue to expand the number of our loan relationship managers to monitor our loans 
these changes coupled with the depth of our existing staff and the substantial experience of our chairman and inb s president in commercial and multifamily real estate lending have had a positive effect on this qualitative factor 
we believe there is substantial experience on our lending and underwriting staff and on our loan committee  which helps mitigate the risk profile of our loan portfolio 
in addition to the general component of the allowance discussed above  the specific component of the allowance relates to loans that are impaired 
a loan is normally deemed impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect both principal and interest due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we consider a variety of factors in determining whether a loan is impaired  including i any notice from the borrower that the borrower will be unable to repay all principal and interest amounts contractually due under the loan agreement  ii any delinquency in the principal and or interest payments other than minimal delays or shortfalls in payments  and iii other information known by us that would indicate the full repayment of principal and interest is not probable 
we generally consider delinquencies of days or less to be minimal delays  and accordingly do not consider such delinquent loans to be impaired in the absence of other indications 
our impaired loans normally consist of loans on nonaccrual status and those classified as troubled debt restructurings tdrs 
generally  impairment for all of our impaired loans is calculated on a loan by loan basis using either the estimated fair value of the loan s collateral less estimated selling costs for collateral dependent loans or the present value of the loan s cash flows for non collateral dependent loans 
any calculated impairment is recognized as a valuation allowance within the overall allowance for loan losses and a charge through the provision for loan losses 
we may charge off any portion of the impaired loan with a corresponding decrease to the valuation allowance when such impairment is confirmed as a loss 
the net carrying amount of an impaired loan net of the valuation allowance does not at any time exceed our recorded investment in the loan 
valuation allowance for real estate losses 
we maintain a valuation allowance for real estate we acquire through foreclosure 
we estimate the fair value of our real estate in the same manner as impaired loans 
we periodically adjust the carrying values of the real estate to reflect decreases in estimated fair values resulting from changing market conditions through an increase to the valuation allowance for real estate losses and a charge to the provision for real estate losses 
summary 
we believe  based on information known to us at the date the allowances are calculated that the level of our allowance for loan losses and valuation allowance for real estate losses was adequate to cover estimated losses in our loan and real estate owned portfolios 
although we believe we use the best information available to make determinations with respect to these allowances  future adjustments to one or both allowances may be necessary if facts and circumstances differ from those previously assumed in their determination 

table of contents additionally  our regulators  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review both of these allowances based on the regulators judgment concerning information available to them during their examination process as well as other factors they utilize for all banks 
accordingly  they may require us to take certain chargeoffs and or recognize additions to the allowances based on their judgments 
other than temporary impairment charges on security investments 
for a discussion of the factors and estimates used in assessing for and computing other than temporary impairment charges on our security investments  see notes and to the financial statements in this report 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
as disclosed in note to the financial statements in this report  we have a deferred tax asset in the amount of million at december   which included unused net operating loss nols and alternative minimum tax credit amt carryfowards 
we determined that it was not necessary to maintain a valuation allowance for our deferred tax asset at any time during the reporting periods in this report because we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax asset will be fully realized 
the need for as well as adjustments increases or decreases to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance is determined by us based upon changes in the expected realization of the deferred tax asset 
we evaluate our deferred tax asset for recoverability quarterly based on all available evidence 
this process involves significant judgment on our part and includes assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between our projected earnings and our actual results 
we are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine  based on available evidence at the time the determination is made  that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be fully realized 
in evaluating the more likely than not criterion  we consider all positive and negative evidence as of the end of each reporting period 
the realization of our deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient future taxable income in the carryforward period under the tax law 
due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances  we may be required to establish and or record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods 
such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and regulatory capital position 
the conclusion not to maintain a valuation allowance as noted above is based on our prior earnings history exclusive of the nol generated in the second quarter of coupled with evidence such as returning to profitability since the third quarter of indicating that we will be able to generate an adequate amount of future taxable income over a reasonable period of time to fully utilize the deferred tax asset 
our ability to realize our deferred tax asset could be reduced in the future if our estimates of future taxable income from our operations and tax planning strategies do not support the realization of our deferred tax asset 
we also need to consider that the amount of our nols and certain other tax attributes realizable for income tax purposes may be reduced under section of the internal revenue code by sales of our common stock  including transactions in the open market by or greater shareholders  if an ownership change is deemed to have occured under section of the internal revenue code by such sales 

table of contents overview of financial results we reported net earnings available to common stockholders of million in  or per common share  compared to net earnings of million  or per share  in  and a net loss of million  or per share  in key points regarding our performance are summarized below 
our total assets decreased to billion at december   from billion at december  and billion at december  our total deposits decreased to billion at december   from billion at december  and billion at december  our total loans  net of deferred fees  decreased to billion at december   from billion at december  and billion at december   despite new loan originations increasing to million in  from million in and million in inb s regulatory capital ratios continued to increase through the retention of earnings and a gradual reduction in the size of its balance sheet 
inb s ratios at december  were as follows tier one leverage  tier one risk based capital  and total risk based capital  well above its minimum requirements of  and  respectively 
inb s tier one capital amounted to million and was million in excess of the required minimum for the tier one leverage ratio at december  our loans on nonaccrual status decreased to million at december   from million at december  and million at december  the category of nonaccrual loans includes certain restructured loans tdrs that are current as to payments and performing in accordance with their renegotiated terms  but are required to be classified nonaccrual based on regulatory guidance 
at december   such loans totaled million compared to million at december  and million at december  these loans were yielding approximately at december  our real estate owned through foreclosure reo decreased to million at december   from million at december  and million at december  our provision for loan and real estate losses decreased to an aggregate of million in  from million in and million in  while real estate expenses were million in  million in and million in our noninterest income inclusive of loan prepayment income which is significant to the total increased to million in  from million in and million in our operating expenses amounted to million in  compared to million in and million in our efficiency ratio which measures our ability to control our expenses as a percentage of our revenues continued to be favorable and was for  compared to for and for our net interest margin exclusive of loan prepayment income increased to in  from in and in net interest and dividend income  which was affected by a smaller balance sheet  decreased to million in from million in and million in our book value per common share after subtracting preferred dividends in arrears increased to at december   from at december  and at december  over the last several years  our operating results have been negatively affected to varying degrees by a weak economy  high rates of unemployment  increased office and retail vacancy rates and an increased supply of distressed properties for sale in the marketplace at discounted prices  all of which have significantly reduced commercial and multifamily real estate values both nationally and in our lending areas 
these unfavorable conditions  particularly in  caused a large number of our loans to become underperforming or nonperforming and substantially increased our loan and real estate loss provisions and related expenses associated with these assets 
our operating results for and rebounded from primarily due to significantly lower levels of these assets and associated provisions for loan and real estate losses and other related carrying expenses 
our problem assets totaled million  or of total assets  at december   down from a high of million  or of total assets  at march  since march  we have taken and continue to take various steps to resolve our problem assets  including executing a bulk sale  proceeding with foreclosures on many of the collateral properties and attempting to sell them  working with certain borrowers to provide payment relief and  in limited cases  accepting partial payment as full satisfaction of the loan either directly from the borrower or through the sale of the loan to a third party 

table of contents as discussed in greater detail elsewhere in this report  the net loss for was largely the result of a bulk sale of certain non performing and underperforming loans and real estate owned at significantly discounted prices in comparison to their carrying values 
we also recorded additional provisions for loan and real estate losses during apart from the bulk sale due to the weak economy  declining real estate values and recommendations from inb s primary regulator 
since early  due primarily to higher regulatory capital requirements imposed on inb and decreased suitable lending opportunities particularly in and  inb has gradually reduced the size of its balance sheet by steadily decreasing its deposit rates and encouraging net deposit outflow  repaying borrowed funds and decreasing the volume of its new loan originations from historical levels 
this posture combined with the retention of operating earnings has increased inb s regulatory capital ratios significantly during this period  while decreasing its net interest and dividend income 
in addition to the higher capital requirements  ibc and inb are also operating under regulatory formal agreements since  which have increased our operating expenses  imposed various operating restrictions on our business  including those impacting our lending and deposit gathering activities  and consumed a large amount of our senior management s time and focus 
as of the date of filing of this report  we believe that we were in compliance with all the requirements of both formal agreements 
inb s regulator has communicated to us that inb must have sustained performance with respect to several articles in its formal agreement in order to achieve full compliance 
we cannot predict when the regulators will consider us in full compliance and when they will lift the formal agreements 
see the section entitled supervision and regulation in item business in this report for further discussion 
our real estate lending activities continue to receive increased oversight from our regulators  including among other things  requiring us to set and manage internal commercial real estate loan concentration limits as a percentage of inb s regulatory capital  as that ratio is defined by the regulators 
furthermore  we cannot predict if additional regulatory burdens may be imposed on our business model in the future 
depending on market conditions and available lending opportunities that are suitable for us  as well as any regulatory constraints that may affect us  the overall size of inb s balance sheet or its loan portfolio may decrease further in the near term 
as a result of our increased capital levels  we are exploring opportunities to repurchase ibc s securities held by the us treasury as part of the capital purchase program 
we would also need to repay accrued but unpaid interest on ibc s junior subordinated debentures as well as dividends in arrears on ibc s series a preferred stock held by the treasury 
ibc s main source of funds to undertake the foregoing actions would require a cash dividend from inb 
the above actions require the approval of both inb s primary regulator  the occ  and ibc s primary regulator  the frb 
late last year  the treasury announced that it will continue to conduct periodic  individual auctions of tarp securities it owns  including those of ibc  although the precise timing of any auction is not known 
in january  ibc and inb applied for the necessary approvals from their respective regulators to permit us to bid for the preferred stock in any such auction 
there is no assurance that such approvals will be granted 
see note to the financial statements included in this report for a further discussion of the tarp securities 
on january   inb reached a settlement agreement with respect to certain litigation it had pursued in connection with a foreclosure action it had commenced in on one of its loans 
inb commenced the action to collect insurance proceeds which it contended had been improperly paid to various third parties 
as a result of the settlement  inb received net proceeds of million in february  which was recorded in february as a million recovery of prior loan charge offs and a million recovery of prior real estate expenses associated with the loan and underlying collateral property

in order for inb to be a member of the frb and fhlb  inb must maintain an investment in the capital stock of each entity  which amounted to million and million  respectively  at december  the frb stock has historically paid a dividend of  while the fhlb stock dividend fluctuates quarterly and was most recently at the rate of 
the total required investment fluctuates based on inb s capital level for the frb stock and inb s loans and outstanding fhlb borrowings for the fhlb stock 
at december   time deposits with banks had a weighted average yield of and remaining maturity of years 

table of contents all of the investments in the preceding table were held by inb 
securities are classified as held to maturity htm and are carried at amortized cost when inb has the intent and ability to hold them to maturity 
a large portion of the resulting proceeds from the net reduction in total investments from december  was used to fund planned deposit outflow and repayment of borrowed funds 
at december   the htm portfolio had a weighted average yield to earliest call date of and a weighted average remaining expected life and contractual maturity of years and years  respectively 
a large number of the securities have fixed interest rates or have predetermined rate increases and call features that allow the issuer to call the security before its stated maturity without penalty 
over the next twelve months  approximately million of securities in the portfolio could potentially be called or repaid assuming market interest rates remain at or near current levels 
a large portion of the resulting proceeds would then be reinvested into similar securities and potentially at lower rates 
at the time of purchase  securities with callable features routinely have higher yields than non callable securities with the same maturity 
however  the callable features or the expiration of the non callable period of the security will most likely result in the early call of securities in a declining or flat rate environment  which results in re investment risk of the proceeds 
at december   the htm portfolio s estimated fair value was million and the portfolio had a net unrealized loss of million

the net decrease in the allowance of million was due to million of chargeoffs  partially offset by million of partial recoveries of prior chargeoffs 
the chargeoffs consisted of the following a portion of loans classified as nonaccrual tdrs or million of aggregate principal was charged off in for financial statement purposes based on annual updated appraisals received on the underlying collateral properties 
although these tdr loans continue to perform as agreed under the modified terms  we reduced their carrying value by these chargeoffs to reflect the lower appraised amounts of the underlying property 
the borrowers remain obligated to pay all contractual principal due on the tdrs 
in addition  other chargeoffs totaling million were recorded during in connection with satisfaction of nonaccrual loans at a discount and another million was partially charged off on other nonaccrual loans due to decreases in the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral 
at december   with respect to all of our impaired loans  which totaled million  we have obtained current appraisals of the underlying collateral as follows dated within the last months  dated within the last months  dated within the last months  and within the last months 
our policy is to obtain externally prepared appraisals for impaired loans at least annually

all other assets the following table sets forth the composition of all other assets at december  in thousands accrued interest receivable loan fees receivable income tax receivable premises and equipment  net deferred income tax asset deferred debenture offering costs  net investment in unconsolidated subsidiaries deferred issuance costs from brokered cds prepaid deposit insurance assessments all other accrued interest receivable fluctuates based on the level of interest earning assets and the timing of interest payments received 
loan fees receivable are fees due to us in accordance with the terms of our mortgage loans 
such amounts are generally due upon the full repayment of the loan 
these fees are recorded as deferred income at the time a loan is originated and is then amortized to interest income over the life of the loan as a yield adjustment 
the decrease was due to payments exceeding new fees that were charged on new loan originations 

table of contents premises and equipment decreased as purchases were more than offset by normal depreciation and amortization 
the deferred income tax asset relates to the unrealized benefit for net temporary differences between the our financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases that will result in future income tax deductions 
such items are normally comprised of the allowance for loan losses  valuation allowance for real estate losses and capitalized real estate expenses  all of which will become tax deductible when actual chargeoffs are incurred  and our net operating loss carryforward that can be used to offset future taxable income 
the decrease in the deferred tax asset was attributable to the partial utilization in of our net operating loss carryforward 
see the section critical accounting policies and note to the financial statements in this report for further discussion 
deferred debenture offering costs consist primarily of underwriters commissions and are amortized over the terms of the debentures 
the net decrease was due to normal amortization 
the investment in unconsolidated subsidiaries consists of ibc s total common stock investment in its wholly owned business trusts  intervest statutory trust ii  iii  iv and v 
prepaid deposit insurance assessments relates to the unamortized portion of the estimated amount of inb s fdic insurance premiums prepaid by inb in december 
this prepayment requirement was imposed on all fdic insured institutions in order to recapitalize the deposit insurance fund 
the prepaid asset will be charged to expense during the future periods to which it relates 
deferred issuance costs from brokered deposits decreased due to normal amortization 
these costs are being amortized to interest expense over the life of the deposits 
deposits total deposits at december  decreased to billion from billion at december   primarily reflecting decreases of million in certificate of deposit accounts cds and million in money market deposit accounts 
at december   cds totaled million  and checking  savings and money market accounts aggregated to million 
the same categories of deposit accounts totaled billion and million  respectively  at december  inb has steadily lowered its overall deposit rates offered for its deposit products since early to encourage deposit outflow including the ongoing repayment of maturing higher cost brokered cds and reduce the overall size of its balance sheet 
cds represented of total deposits at december   compared to at december  at december  and  cds included million and million of brokered deposits  respectively

net interest and dividend income net interest and dividend income is our primary source of earnings and is influenced by the amount  distribution and repricing characteristics of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as well as by the relative levels and movements of interest rates 
net interest and dividend income is the difference between interest income earned on our interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and interest expense paid on our interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
our net interest and dividend income detailed in the table that follows decreased by million to million in from million in the decrease largely reflected a planned reduction in the size of inb s balance sheet 
in  our total average interest earning assets decreased by million from  reflecting decreases of million in average loans and million in average total securities and overnight investments 
at the same time  average deposits and borrowed funds decreased by million and million  respectively  while our average stockholders equity increased by million 
the reduction in the balance sheet positively impacted our regulatory capital ratios  but negatively impacted our total net interest and dividend income 
our net interest margin increased to in from in the margin benefited from an improved interest rate spread  partially offset by a million decrease in net average interest earning assets due to a higher level of cash on hand 
the interest rate spread improved by basis points due to a steady reduction in the rates we paid on deposits and the run off of higher cost maturing cds and borrowings  largely offset by payoffs of higher yielding loans and calls of higher yielding security investments  coupled with the re investment of a large portion of these cash inflows into new loans and securities at lower market interest rates 
overall  our average cost of funds decreased by basis points to in  from in  while our average yield on interest earning assets decreased at a slower pace or by basis points to in  from in 
table of contents the following table provides information on average assets  liabilities and stockholders equity  yields earned on interest earning assets  and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated 
the yields and rates shown are based on a computation of income expense including any related fee income or expense for each year divided by average interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities during each year 
average balances are derived from daily balances 
net interest margin is computed by dividing net interest and dividend income by the average of total interest earning assets during each year 
the interest rate spread is the difference between the yield earned on interest earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin is greater than the interest rate spread due to the additional income earned on those assets funded by non interest bearing liabilities  demand deposits and stockholders equity

a portion of the provision was also a function of input received from inb s primary regulator  which required inb to place greater emphasis on peer group analysis when evaluating and computing its allowance for loan losses 
throughout and  the weak economy  high unemployment  increased office and retail vacancy rates and an increased supply of distressed properties for sale in the marketplace at discounted prices significantly reduced commercial and multifamily real estate values both nationally and in our lending areas

the decrease in fdic insurance premiums was nearly all the result of a change in the fdic s formula for assessing premiums resulting from the dodd frank wall street reform consumer protection act as discussed in the section deposit insurance assessments under the caption supervision and regulation in item business of this report 
this change in computing and assessing premiums positively impacted inb s fdic insurance expense in by million

liquidity and capital resources general 
liquidity risk involves the risk of being unable to fund our assets with the appropriate duration and rate based liabilities  as well as the risk of not being able to meet unexpected cash needs 
we manage our liquidity position on a daily basis to assure that funds are available to meet our operating requirements  loan and investment commitments  deposit withdrawals and debt service obligations 
our primary sources of funds consist of the following retail deposits obtained through inb s branch offices and the mail  principal repayments of loans  maturities and calls of securities  borrowings through fhlb advances or the federal funds market  brokered deposits  and cash flow provided by our operating activities 
for additional detail concerning our actual cash flows  see the statements of cash flows in this report 
intervest national bank 
inb s lending business is dependent on its ability to generate a positive interest rate spread between the yields earned on its loans and the rates offered on its deposits 
inb relies heavily on certificates of deposit time deposits as its main source of funds and needs to pay competitive interest rates to attract and retain deposits to fund its loan originations 
the stability of deposits as a funding source is affected by numerous factors  including returns available to our depositors on alternative investments  safety and fdic insurance limits  the quality of our customer service and other competitive forces 
at december   inb had cash and short term investments totaling million and approved commitments to lend of million which excludes an additional million of potential new loan commitments that were in process as of december   most of which are anticipated to be funded over the next months from cash on hand 
deposits 
at december   total deposits amounted to billion consisting of cds totaling million  and checking  savings and money market accounts aggregating to million 
cds represented of total deposits and cds of  or more totaled million and included million of brokered deposits 
brokered deposits had a weighted average remaining term and stated interest rate of years and  respectively  at december   and million mature by december  at december   million  or of total cds inclusive of brokered deposits  mature within one year 
inb expects to repay its brokered deposits as they mature and to retain or replace a significant portion of its remaining maturing cds  although no assurance can be given that the deposit restrictions discussed below will not negatively impact inb s ability to retain or attract deposits in the future 
these restrictions may negatively impact inb s ability to offer competitive deposit rates in its primary deposit gathering market areas 
in  inb experienced net deposit outflow of million  consisting of the repayment of million of maturing brokered deposits and million of other maturing cds and a million net reduction in money market and checking deposit accounts 
inb has steadily lowered its overall deposit rates offered for its deposit products since early to encourage deposit outflow and reduce the overall size of its balance sheet 
depending on market conditions and available lending opportunities  inb may decrease the size of its balance sheet further in the near term 
inb s total deposits may also decrease further due to the expected repayment of its maturing brokered deposits and from the potential effects of deposit rate restrictions that have been imposed on inb 

table of contents as a result of its formal agreement with the occ  its primary regulator  inb is required in the absence of obtaining a waiver from the fdic to maintain its deposit pricing at or below the national rates published by the fdic  plus basis points 
the fdic s national rate is a simple average of rates paid by us depository institutions as calculated by the fdic 
at december   inb was in compliance with this requirement on all of its deposit products 
rates offered by inb on certain of its deposit products as of december  ranged as follows money market accounts offered at basis points below the maximum  year cd offered at basis points below the maximum  year cd offered at basis points below the maximum  and year cd offered at the maximum 
furthermore  inb is not allowed to accept  renew or rollover brokered deposits without the prior approval of the occ 
inb has not accessed the brokered deposit market since september inb expects to fund future deposit outflow  if any  through a portion of the cash flows from the repayments of loans and or expected calls of its agency security investments 
inb s current objective is to maintain its deposit rates at levels that are in compliance with its deposit rate restrictions while attempting to promote a stable deposit base that can be adjusted to meet its cash flow needs 
inb has historically targeted its loan to deposit ratio in a range from to 
this ratio stood at as of december  loans and securities 
at december   inb had million  or  of its loan portfolio excluding nonaccrual loans scheduled to mature within one year 
inb expects to extend or refinance a portion of these maturing loans 
additionally  over the next twelve months  approximately million of inb s security investments could potentially be called if interest rates remain at or near current levels 
absent a need for these cash inflows  a large portion is expected to be reinvested into similar securities  with potentially lower market rates 
borrowed funds 
in  inb repaid million of its maturing fhlb advances and retired early another million of fhlb advances prior to their contractual maturity dates 
at december   inb had no borrowed funds outstanding 
credit lines 
at december   inb had available collateral consisting of investment securities and certain loans that could be pledged to support an aggregate of approximately million in borrowings from the fhlb and frb 
inb also had access to overnight unsecured lines of credit from two banks totaling million 
this total borrowing capacity of million represents a decrease of million from december   due to a lower level of security investments outstanding 
at december   inb s secured lines of credit represented approximately of inb s deposits that are considered sensitive money market accounts and all certificate of deposit accounts cds  inclusive of brokered cds  maturing within one year 
in the event that any of inb s existing lines of credit were not accessible or were limited  inb could designate all or a portion of its un pledged us government agency investment securities portfolio as available for sale and sell such securities as needed to provide liquidity 
capital resources 
as discussed in note to the financial statements in this report  at december   inb s regulatory capital ratios exceeded its current minimum requirements and inb does not expect to need additional capital over the next twelve months 
intervest bancshares corporation 
at december   ibc had cash and short term investments totaling million  of which million was available for use inclusive of million on deposit with inb 
at december   ibc had accumulated and unpaid preferred tarp dividends in arrears of million and accrued and unpaid interest of million on its outstanding trust preferred securities 
dividend and interest payment restrictions 
ibc has historically received cash dividends from inb to fund the interest payments due on ibc s trust preferred securities as well as for ibc s payment of preferred dividends 
since january  inb has suspended the declaration and payment of dividends to ibc as required by inb s primary regulator  the occ 
since february  ibc  as required by its primary regulator  the frb  has also suspended the declaration and payment of dividends on its capital stock and payment of interest on its trust preferred securities 
dividends in arrears are recorded as a reduction in common stockholders equity only when they are declared and payable 

table of contents the regularly scheduled interest payments on the trust preferred securities continue to be accrued and are recorded as interest expense in our financial statements 
the interest and preferred dividend payments referred to above can only resume at such time as both ibc and inb are permitted to do so and upon the determination that such payments are consistent with ibc s and inb s overall financial performance and capital requirements 
the deferral of interest payments does not constitute a default under the indentures governing the trust preferred securities 
if ibc misses six quarterly preferred dividend payments  whether or not consecutive  the treasury  the current holder of the preferred stock  has the right to appoint two directors to ibc s board of directors until all accrued but unpaid dividends have been paid 
as of december   ibc had missed consecutive preferred dividend payments 
during  the treasury exercised its right and appointed two directors to ibc s board 
see notes and to the financial statements in this report for a further discussion of missed dividend payments 
capital resources 
as discussed in note to the financial statements in this report  ibc s regulatory capital ratios at december  exceeded its current minimum requirements and ibc does not expect to need additional capital over the next twelve months 
tarp 
as a result of our increased capital levels  we are exploring opportunities to repurchase ibc s securities held by the us treasury as part of the capital purchase program 
we would also need to repay accrued but unpaid interest on ibc s junior subordinated debentures as well as dividends in arrears on ibc s series a preferred stock held by the treasury 
ibc s main source of funds to undertake the foregoing actions would require a cash dividend from inb 
the above actions require the approval of both inb s primary regulator  the occ  and ibc s primary regulator  the frb 
late last year  the treasury announced that it will continue to conduct periodic  individual auctions of tarp securities it owns  including those of ibc  although the precise timing of any auction is not known 
in january  ibc and inb applied for the necessary approvals from their respective regulators to permit us to bid for the preferred stock in any such auction 
there is no assurance that such approvals will be granted

asset and liability management we have interest rate risk that arises from differences in the repricing of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities within a given time period 
the primary objective of our asset liability management strategy is to limit  within established board approved policy guidelines  the adverse effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and capital 
we have never engaged in trading or hedging activities  nor invested in interest rate derivatives or entered into interest rate swaps 
in order to manage interest rate risk  inb uses a third party vendor to prepare quarterly asset and liability management reports using an earnings simulation model to quantify the effects of various interest rate scenarios on inb s projected net interest and dividend income over specified periods  and the related impacts on its balance sheet and capital 
these computations begin with our internally prepared gap analysis which is then further adjusted for additional assumptions regarding balance sheet growth and composition  and the specific pricing and repricing and maturity characteristics of inb s assets and liabilities 
gap analysis measures the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that mature or reprice within a given time period 
there are numerous assumptions that are made by us to compute the gap and to run the earnings simulation model 
a change in any of these assumptions could materially alter the results of both 
an asset or liability is normally considered to be interest rate sensitive if it will reprice or mature within one year or less 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities scheduled to mature or reprice within one year 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
conversely  a gap is considered negative when the opposite is true 
in a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to increase net interest income 
in a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to increase net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
if the repricing of our assets and liabilities were equally flexible and moved concurrently  the impact of any increase or decrease in interest rates on our net interest income would be minimal 

table of contents a simple interest rate gap analysis by itself may not be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates for the following reasons 
income associated with interest earning assets and costs associated with interest bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates 
in addition  the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
callable features of certain assets and liabilities  in addition to the foregoing  may also cause actual experience to vary from the analysis 
in addition  certain assets with adjustable rates may have features generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors  which limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in the event of a change in interest rates  asset prepayment and early deposit withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the interest rate gap 
the amount of loan prepayments cannot be predicted with accuracy and we experience reinvestment risk associated with the investment of the resulting proceeds 
the ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase  and the behavior of depositors may be different from those assumed in the gap analysis 
as discussed elsewhere in this report  the amount of fixed rate loans in our loan portfolio has increased over the last several years and such loans constitute approximately  or million  of our loan portfolio at december  we also have loans approximately or million in the portfolio that have terms that call for predetermined increases in the interest rate at various times over the life of the loan 
included in our fixed rate loans above is approximately million of loans originated mostly in whereby the borrower has the option prior to maturity and with the payment of a specified fee  to extend the loan for a new term at an interest rate per annum equal to the greater of the old rate or a new rate based on a fixed spread ranging from to basis points over a specified index  subject to meeting our underwriting requirements 
the future repricing of our loans that have predetermined rate increases or the aforementioned options may not be at the same magnitude as general changes in market rates 
our loan portfolio at december  also included approximately or million of floating rate loans that have a floor or minimum rate that was determined in relation to prevailing market rates on the date of origination 
this floor only adjusts upwards in the event of increases in the loan s interest rate 
our entire loan portfolio had a short weighted average life of approximately years at december  the table below summarizes our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december   scheduled to mature or reprice within the periods shown

table of contents significant assumptions used in preparing the preceding gap table follow floating rate loans  loans with predetermined rate increases and floating rate borrowings are included in the period in which their interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which they mature 
fixed rate loans  including those with options to extend are scheduled according to their contractual maturities 
deferred loan fees and the effect of possible loan prepayments are excluded from the analysis 
nonaccrual loans of million are also excluded from the table 
securities are scheduled according to the earlier of their next callable date or the date on which the interest rate is scheduled to change 
a large number of the securities have predetermined interest rate increases or steps up to a specified rate on one or more predetermined dates 
generally  the security becomes eligible for redemption by the issuer at the date of the first scheduled step up 
the net carrying value or million of corporate securities that are on a cash basis of accounting are excluded from the table 
interest checking  savings and money market deposits are regarded as readily accessible withdrawable accounts and certificates of deposit are scheduled according to their contractual maturity dates 
this assumption contributes significantly to the liability sensitive position reported per the one year gap analysis 
however  if such deposits were treated differently  the one year gap would then change accordingly 
it should be noted that depositors may not necessarily immediately withdraw funds in the event deposit rates offered by inb did not change as quickly and uniformly as changes in general market rates 
at december   the gap analysis above indicated that our interest bearing liabilities that were scheduled to mature or reprice within one year exceeded our interest earning assets that were scheduled to mature or reprice within one year 
this one year interest rate sensitivity gap amounted to a negative million  or a negative of total assets  at december  as a result of the negative one year gap  the composition of our balance sheet at december  was considered liability sensitive  indicating that our interest bearing liabilities would generally reprice with changes in interest rates more rapidly than our interest earning assets 
the table below summarizes the results of certain scenarios of our earnings simulation model as of december  the model takes into account our gap analysis as further adjusted by additional assumptions  including deposit decay factors for both rate and non rate sensitive deposits 
furthermore  in determining the assumed rates offered on our deposit accounts in the model  we use internally developed beta factors that utilize historical data based on a specific time frames for both rising and declining interest rate environments 
rate shock scenario in thousands base net interest and dividend income basis point decrease basis point increase basis point increase next months change next months change year cumulative change the model for this scenario covers a month horizon and assumes interest rate changes are gradually ramped up or down over a month horizon using various assumptions based upon a parallel yield curve shift and are subsequently sustained at those levels for the remainder of the simulation horizon 
the model for this scenario utilizes an instantaneous parallel rate shock and is maintained at those levels for the entire simulation horizon 
a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact our net interest and dividend income to a larger extent than noted above if interest rates on our assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis  as those assumed in the model 
recent accounting standards update see note the financial statements in this report for a discussion of this topic 

table of contents impact of inflation and changing prices our financial statements and related financial data presented in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
because virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and in prices 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in our lending  security investing  deposit taking and borrowing activities 
we do not engage in and accordingly have no risk related to trading accounts  commodities  interest rate hedges or foreign exchange 
the measurement of market risk associated with financial instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on and off balance sheet transactions are aggregated  and the resulting net positions are identified 
disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments which reflect changes in market prices and rates  can be found in note to the financial statements included in this report 
we also actively monitor and manage our interest rate risk exposure as discussed under the caption asset and liability management in this report
