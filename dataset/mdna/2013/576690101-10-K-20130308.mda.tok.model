item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an integrated producer of high performance advanced engineered materials used in a variety of electrical  electronic  thermal and structural applications 
our products are sold into numerous markets  including consumer electronics  industrial components and commercial aerospace  defense and science  medical  energy  automotive electronics  telecommunications infrastructure and appliance 
sales of billion in were lower than our record high sales of billion in market conditions and the associated demand levels were mixed during we were encouraged by the continuing improvement of our medical market sales and shipments into the industrial components and commercial aerospace market 
consumer electronics sales were adversely impacted by changes within the led sector while energy sales softened due to a reduction in the oil and gas rig count and the weakness of the solar energy sector 
within the defense and science market  sales for defense applications softened as a result of government budget cuts and the timing of programs while sales for science applications improved 
our sales in were also affected by differences in the metal price pass through  the use of customer supplied metal and our discontinuation of a product line 
gross margin of million in was million lower than the gross margin in margins were negatively impacted by the lower volumes in but benefitted from a favorable change in product mix and improved pricing 
the gross margin in was also negatively impacted by a physical inventory loss recorded in the fourth quarter 
implementation and start up of the new beryllium facility continued in and  while the associated additional costs reduced margins  improvements in the output and manufacturing efficiencies were made throughout the year 
during  we announced the consolidation of various operations that included the closing of three small facilities and the relocation of their businesses to other facilities 
these actions were designed to improve customer service levels and operating efficiencies while reducing costs over the long term 
one time costs associated with the consolidation plan totaled million in as a result of the lower gross margin and the facility consolidation costs  as well as an increase in expenses  operating profit declined from million in to million in earnings per share were in and in cash flow from operations was solid once again  as we generated million in cash flow in the fourth quarter was particularly strong 
we declared a quarterly dividend on our common shares starting in the second quarter and paid million to shareholders during the year 
in the first quarter  we acquired the outstanding stock of aerospace metal composites limited amc  a small manufacturing operation that produces metal matrix composites 
the amc acquisition followed the acquisition of the outstanding stock of eis optics limited eis  a producer of optical filters and related materials  in the fourth quarter results of operations millions except per share amounts net sales operating profit income before income taxes net income diluted earnings per share sales were billion in  a decline of million  or  from sales of billion in sales in were million  or  higher than sales of billion in the decline in sales in was partially due to a lower metal price pass through  an increase in the use of customer supplied metal and the discontinuation of a non strategic product line  while the changes in sales by market were mixed 
sales to the consumer electronics market  our largest market  improved slightly in over after adjusting for differences in metal price pass through and use of customer supplied metal 
the growth was primarily due to the acquisition of eis 
sales to the consumer electronics market in were negatively affected by softer sales for led applications due to changes in market conditions 
sales to the consumer electronics market grew approximately in over  but this growth was mainly due to higher metal pass through prices 
end use applications for our materials in the consumer electronics market include cell phones  tablets  gaming systems and other hand held devices  and the market demand for increased power and miniaturization in these applications favors the use of our high performance materials 
as a material supplier  we sell to stamping houses and sub assembly shops so we are several steps removed from the final consumer 
our sales to this market in a given period  therefore  are affected by downstream inventory levels and production schedules and changes in market share of the intermediaries within the supply chain and not necessarily by changes in sales of the final product or in consumer demand in that period 
while our marketing staff works closely with various demand generators to develop new applications  technologies can be closely guarded for competitive reasons and we do lose applications from time to time due to rapid changes in technologies and applications that have short life spans 
underlying volumes sold to the industrial components and commercial aerospace market continued to grow in both and the growth in both years was driven by higher sales of materials for heavy equipment  as a result of product development and market penetration efforts  and improved aerospace market conditions 
sales of x ray windows for industrial applications also contributed to the sales growth in over but sales of these products softened in sales to the industrial components and aerospace market were approximately of our total sales in defense and science market sales  which were approximately of our total sales in  declined at a double digit rate in from primarily as a result of government delays and spending cuts 
the majority of the decline was in optics and precious metal applications as our traditional beryllium based defense and science sales showed a more minor decline 
defense and science sales in were relatively unchanged from sales to the medical market grew in and over the respective prior year largely due to increased sales for blood glucose test strip applications 
medical sales  which also include x ray window applications  accounted for approximately of our total sales in energy market sales softened in from after growing significantly in over sales for oil and gas applications  which were a main driver for the growth in  declined in due to a reduction in the rig count 
sales of materials for solar energy  fuel cells and other alternative energy applications contributed to the growth in but declined in due to weaker market conditions 
energy market sales were of our total sales in automotive electronics sales declined slightly in from after growing at a double digit rate in over the growth in beryllium copper strip sales  primarily in the us  was partially offset by softer demand in europe and weaker sales of optics 
the growth in was largely due to solid demand in the domestic and european markets 
automotive electronics sales were approximately of total sales in the order entry rate strengthened in the first half of over a weak fourth quarter  but then softened in the second half of the year 
total order entry was higher than sales in similar to  order entry rates started off fairly strong  but weakened in the second half of the year and in the fourth quarter in particular 
the total order entry level in  while higher than the order entry level in  was approximately lower than sales in our sales are affected by metal prices  as changes in the prices we pay for precious metals and various base metals  primarily copper  are passed on to our customers 
the average prices for the metals we purchased in were lower than they were in when the prices for various metals reached all time or near term record highs 
the net change in metal prices resulted in an estimated million decrease in sales in from and an estimated million increase in sales in over we manufacture precious metal products using our metal that we sell to the customer or on a toll basis using metal that the customer supplies to us 
shifts in the relationship between the use of owned versus customer supplied metal can affect the sales comparisons between periods  and in  customer supplied metal increased as a percent of the total metal shipped 
this shift in the source of metal reduced our sales of precious metal by an estimated million in compared to since the cost of the precious metal is a pass through  a change in the metal source does not have a corresponding impact on gross margin 
as part of our product rationalization efforts  we exited the silver investment bar business in this non strategic product line generated extremely low margins that could not support the associated level of working capital and overhead 
this action resulted in a reduction of sales of approximately million in from with an immaterial impact on profitability 
the acquisition of amc in the first quarter had a minor impact on sales as did having a full year of eis in after it was acquired in the fourth quarter domestic sales declined in from after growing in over domestic sales include the majority of the impact of the differences in metal price pass through between periods 
international sales  which are included in each of our reportable segments  grew in over and in over gross margin was million  or of sales  in versus million  or of sales  in and million  or of sales  in the lower sales volumes reduced gross margin by an estimated million in from while differences in the volumes sold by the four segments between and resulted in a net increase of million in gross margin in over the change in product mix was favorable in partially due to higher sales of precious metal products for medical applications and pure beryllium metal products that generally generate higher margins 
the change in product mix effect was unfavorable in margins also benefited from improved pricing in portions of our business in both and improved yields on nickel products generated a margin benefit in as compared to after the lower yields and associated higher costs reduced margins in from installation and start up of our new beryllium facility continued throughout and at the elmore  ohio plant site 
the resulting additional operating and material costs and manufacturing inefficiencies reduced gross margin by an estimated million in and an estimated million in the gross margin in was reduced by a net physical inventory adjustment of million recorded in the fourth quarter at a facility within the advanced material technologies segment 
we believe that a portion  and perhaps a significant portion  of this loss may be due to theft 
while a minor amount of stolen material was recovered and an arrest was made  the full scope of the potential theft has not yet been determined as the internal and criminal investigations were still in progress as of early in the first quarter of we have insurance for theft and the carrier was notified accordingly 
since the amount of any recovery was still uncertain  an insurance recoverable was not recorded in and the benefit from any insurance proceeds will be recorded in a future period 
shipments to customers were not affected by the inventory short 
physical inventories were taken at this facility in the first and second quarters in that resulted in a combined net short of million 
we recorded a net unfavorable inventory valuation adjustment of million in the fourth quarter this loss was also recorded within the advanced material technologies segment 
we have no evidence to believe that this loss was due to theft 
the acquisitions of eis and amc provided additional gross margin in over while eis provided a minor margin increase in over we recorded a million benefit to gross margin in as a result of the depletion of a last in  first out lifo inventory layer 
there was no corresponding benefit recorded in or the annual expense on the domestic defined benefit pension plan was million in  million in and million in the increase in the pension expense in and was due to changes in the discount rate  the performance of the plan assets and other factors and affected cost of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses and  to a lesser extent  research and development expenses 
see critical accounting policies 
during  we announced the consolidation of several of our smaller operations in order to improve efficiencies and cash flows 
specifically our microelectronics packaging business will relocate from massachusetts to singapore in order to more effectively service the customer base in malaysia 
the relocation is planned to be completed in the first half of the precious metal facility in the czech republic was shut down in the fourth quarter and going forward the existing customer base will be serviced from our facility in ireland 
the czech operation had limited market penetration and was unprofitable 
we had excess manufacturing capacity in our optical coatings operations  partially due to softer demand for these products for defense applications  and  as a result  we will close a facility in california and relocate strategic assets to other facilities during we also reduced the headcount at the related facility in china in the second half of the albuquerque  new mexico operations will be consolidated from four separate buildings into two buildings in in order to improve work flow and space utilization and reduce overhead costs 
costs associated with these actions  including severance  equipment write offs  relocations and other related items  totaled million in with million recorded in cost of sales  million recorded in selling  general and administrative expense and million recorded in net other expense 
approximately employees  or of our work force  will be affected once all of these actions are completed 
we estimate that there will be no net impact on pre tax income from these actions in as the additional costs to finalize the consolidations will offset the associated benefits gained 
we also estimate that these actions should generate savings in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million of sales in  million of sales in and million of sales in legal  administrative and marketing expenses associated with the change of our name to materion corporation in the first quarter totaled million in and million in costs associated with the name change were immaterial in the incentive compensation expense on plans that pay in cash was million lower in than in and million lower in than the changes in the annual expense between years were caused primarily by the performance of the individual operations relative to their plans objectives 
stock based compensation expense  including the expense for stock appreciation rights  restricted stock and performance restricted shares  was million in  million in and million in the comparison of stock based compensation expense between years may be affected by changes in plan design  the number of grants in a given year  actual performance relative to the plans objectives  movement in our stock price  forfeitures  vesting schedules and other factors 
expenses incurred by eis and amc subsequent to their acquisitions increased sg a expenses by million in over and million in over acquisition related expenses for legal  accounting and due diligence services totaled million in and million in as a result of a change in accounting regulations effective january   acquisition related expenses must be charged against income as incurred 
previously  these expenses would have been capitalized as part of the cost of the acquisitions 
various corporate costs increased in over after increasing in over a portion of the higher costs was due to various initiatives  including a new centralized procurement function  that are designed to produce long term savings and improve profitability across the organization 
other costs  including information technology  environmental  health and safety  business development and communications  have increased in order to support a larger and more diverse organization 
legal compliance costs were also higher in over but leveled off in research and development r d expenses were million in  million in and million in while r d expenses increased in and over the respective prior year  the expense was less than of sales in each of the three years presented 
the majority of the increase in was due to expenses incurred by eis 
the higher expense in was due to an increase in activity levels and various special projects 
our r d staff works closely with production engineers  sales engineers and marketing to support the development of new products and applications as well as to make improvements in the current product portfolio 
derivative ineffectiveness expense was million in there was no derivative ineffectiveness recorded in or the ineffectiveness recorded in related to copper based derivatives that did not qualify for hedge accounting and matured during that year 
other net expense totaled million in  million in and million in see note n to the consolidated financial statements for the details of the major components of other net expense for each of the three years 
the major differences in other net expense between the years are described below 
the metal consignment fee was million lower in than in  mainly due to differences in the rate charged by the financial institutions and lower average metal prices 
the consignment fee increased million in over as a result of higher metal prices and increased quantities of metal on hand 
the net foreign currency exchange and translation gains totaled million in compared to net losses of million in and million in these gains and losses result from movements in the value of the us dollar versus other currencies  primarily the euro and yen  and the related impact on certain foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities and transactions and the maturity of foreign currency hedge contracts 
the purchase agreement for our acquisition of the outstanding stock of barr associates  inc in included an earn out feature that would require us to make additional payments to the prior owners of barr based upon barr performance against identified benchmarks over the to period 
the present value of the earn out was estimated to be million at the time of the acquisition and was recorded in other long term liabilities 
no payments were required to be made in  or based upon barr actual performance relative to the individual benchmarks for those years 
we determined that the fair value of this liability  based upon the facts and circumstances and updated projections  should be reduced to zero as of december  we had previously reduced the fair value of the liability to million as of december  based upon a review of the facts and circumstances at that time 
the million benefit from the reduction to the liability in the fourth quarter and the million benefit from the liability reduction taken in the fourth quarter were recorded as income in those respective periods in accordance with accounting guidelines 
other net in included a million benefit from the favorable resolution of a lawsuit that we had filed against a utility provider for raising our billing rates  which was in violation of our contract 
in the fourth quarter  the court ruled in our favor and we received million in full satisfaction of our claim 
we donated our former headquarters building and the associated land to a non profit organization  which resulted in a write off of the carrying value of million to other net expense in the majority of this unfavorable impact on income before income taxes was offset by a favorable income tax adjustment in that year 
operating profit was million in compared to million in the million decline in profitability was due to lower gross margin as a result of the reduced volumes  the physical inventory differences and other factors  the charges recorded for the plant consolidations and higher sg a expenses 
operating profit in was million lower than the operating profit of million generated in the decline resulted from the margin benefit from changes in the sales volume being more than offset by the additional plant start up costs  other margin issues  higher sg a expenses  an increase in metal consignment fees and other factors 
interest expense net was million in  million in and million in the increase in expense in over was due primarily to higher average debt levels and  to a lesser extent  an increase in the average borrowing rate 
the average outstanding debt levels were similar in and  while the average effective borrowing rate was slightly higher in than in  particularly in the second half of income before income taxes and income tax expense for each of the past three years were as follows millions income before income taxes income tax expense effective tax rate the effects of percentage depletion a tax benefit resulting from our mining operations  foreign source income and deductions  the production deduction  executive compensation  discrete events and other items were major causes of the differences between the effective and statutory rates in each of the three years 
the research and experimentation credit provided a tax benefit in  but this credit was not extended by the federal government for until january accounting regulations require us to record the tax expense based upon the laws in effect at the end of the year and  even though the research and experimentation credit will be used to determine our actual liability on our tax return  the benefit of this credit will not be recorded in our consolidated statement of income until the first quarter the tax expense included net favorable discrete items of million as a result of a change in tax rates in japan that affected the carrying value of certain deferred tax assets  a reduction to the tax reserves due to the lapse of the statute of limitations  adjustments to the tax returns that were finalized during and other items 
the tax expense in included net favorable discrete items of million due to a combination of a reduction to the tax reserves as a result of the lapse of the statute of limitations  adjustments to the tax returns that were finalized in the third quarter and other items 
the tax expense in included million for the reduction of a deferred tax asset as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act 
beginning in  we will no longer be able to claim an income tax deduction for prescription drug benefits provided to our retirees and reimbursed under the medicare part d retiree drug subsidy program 
the tax expense also included the unfavorable impact of a net million increase in the tax reserves that was recorded in accordance with accounting guidelines 
see note p to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the statutory and effective tax rates 
net income was million  or per share diluted  in compared to million  or per share diluted  in and million  or per share diluted  in segment disclosures results by segment are shown in note m to the consolidated financial statements 
the all other column in note m includes our parent company expenses  other corporate charges and the operating results of materion services inc  a wholly owned subsidiary that provides administrative and financial oversight services to our other businesses on a cost plus basis 
in  we changed our name from brush engineered materials inc to materion corporation 
we changed the names of the majority of our subsidiaries as well 
we also changed the names of our four reportable segments but the name change did not alter our operating structure nor did it change the make up of those segments 
the all other column shows an operating loss of million in compared to million in and million in the reduction in the loss in from was due to the costs associated with the company name change incurred in and an increase in costs charged to the business units offset in part by an increase in various corporate costs and other factors 
the primary difference between the and results was due to the costs associated with the company name change  due diligence and acquisition costs  various corporate initiatives and other factors offset in part by lower incentive compensation and an increase in costs charged out to the business units 
advanced material technologies millions net sales operating profit advanced material technologies manufactures precious  non precious and specialty metal products  including vapor deposition targets  frame lid assemblies  clad and precious metal preforms  high temperature braze materials  ultra fine wire  advanced chemicals  optics  performance coatings and microelectronic packages 
these products are used in wireless  semiconductor  photonic  hybrid and other microelectronic applications within the consumer electronics and telecommunications infrastructure markets 
other key markets for these products include medical  defense and science  energy and industrial components 
advanced material technologies also has metal cleaning operations and in house refineries that allow for the reclaim of precious metals from internally generated or customers scrap 
this segment has domestic facilities in new york  connecticut  wisconsin  new mexico  massachusetts and california and international facilities in asia and europe 
sales from advanced material technologies were million  a decline of million  or  from sales of billion in sales in were an improvement of million  or  over sales of million in the previously discussed impact of changes in the amount of customer supplied metal flowed through this segment sales as did the discontinuation of investment bar sales 
we adjust our selling prices to reflect the price we pay for the precious and various non precious metals sold 
while a change in the cost of the metal is generally a pass through to the customer  we generate a margin on our fabrication efforts irrespective of the type of metal used in a given application 
on average  the applicable metal prices were higher in each of and than the respective prior years  although the increase in prices in was not substantial 
we estimate that the higher metal price pass through increased advanced material technologies sales an estimated million in from and million in over while the metal price impact was greater than the total sales increase in  underlying volumes processed grew in due to differences in product mix  customer supplied metal and other factors 
after adjusting for differences in the metal price pass through and the use of customer supplied metal  advanced material technologies sales to the consumer electronics and medical markets increased in over while sales to its other major markets were flat to down 
the majority of the sales into the consumer electronics market from this segment are vapor deposition targets  lids  wire and other related precious and non precious metal products for semiconductors and other microelectronic applications 
these materials are used in wireless  led  handheld devices and other applications as well as in a number of applications within the defense and science market 
the growth in consumer electronics sales in was largely due to the acquisition of eis  which produces optical coatings and related products for projection display  gaming and other applications 
consumer electronic sales in were flat with as strong sales in the first half of that year were offset by a weaker second half of the year due to stagnant demand 
sales of precious metal products for led applications into the consumer electronics market declined in due to the slower than anticipated growth in end use consumer demand for led products driven by the high price to the final customer 
as a result  manufacturers of led products have been designing ways to reduce costs  including reducing the consumption of high cost materials 
these new designs use less of our materials and therefore negatively impact the level of our shipments for these applications 
this change also resulted in excess downstream inventories during that needed to be worked down  further depressing our sales in the short term 
since we are an up front material supplier  changes in our consumer electronics sales levels do not necessarily correspond to changes in the end use consumer demand in the same period due to downstream inventory positions  the time to develop and deploy new products and manufacturing lead times and scheduling 
while our product and market development efforts allow us to capture new applications  we do lose existing applications and customers from time to time due to the rapid change in technologies and other factors 
sales of large area coatings products  primarily precision precious metal coated polymer films  grew approximately in over and in over after adjusting for the estimated metal price difference 
the growth in was predominately due to application development efforts and geographic expansion of our sales of blood glucose test strip materials into the medical market as well as share gains within the existing customer base 
lower manufacturing yields and the inability to hold tolerances resulted in missed sales to a key customer and the loss of a portion of the business to our competitor in new processes were developed and qualified with the customer and shipment levels improved during the sales growth in was also due to product development and share gains with other customers 
sales of advanced chemical products for led  optics  security  photovoltaic and other applications from the wisconsin operations declined approximately in from after growing approximately in over weaker conditions within the solar energy market were a main cause for the decline in advanced chemical sales in the majority of the growth in was due to the expanded use of led technologies and the development of new applications 
however  the growth rate slowed down in the second half of and led sales in were affected by the previously discussed changes in market conditions 
precision optical coating sales were higher in than in due to the acquisition of eis 
absent the eis acquisition  optics sales declined approximately in from largely due to lower defense and science sales resulting from changes in government spending patterns and cutbacks 
this decline in sales was a main cause for the decision to close our small optical coating operation in california 
sales of optics for medical applications  which were minor  also declined in as did sales for infra red camera applications within the automotive electronics market 
the eis acquisition was the main cause for the slight increase in optics sales in over optics sales into the defense and science market declined while sales to the medical and other markets improved slightly in over refining and chamber cleaning revenue was lower in than in partially due to the lower business levels at the now closed czech operation 
refining revenue grew in over in part due to the expansion of our operations and increased marketing efforts 
refining revenue is also partially a function of the volume of precious metal products sold and the available quantity of metal in the market to be reclaimed 
order entry for the advanced material technologies segment was approximately higher than sales in and lower than sales in all of the facilities affected by the previously discussed consolidation program in are part of the advanced material technologies segment and the associated costs were recorded against the segment cost of sales  sg a and other net expenses 
advanced material technologies generated a gross margin of million in of sales  million of sales in and million of sales in the decline in gross margin dollars in as compared to was due in part to the previously discussed million physical inventory loss recorded in the fourth quarter margins also declined due to the impact of the lower sales volume in  but this was partially offset by the incremental margin generated by eis 
margins benefited from a favorable change in product mix due to the increase in higher margin medical market sales and a decline in investment bar sales and manufacturing overhead costs decreased approximately in from in addition to the improved product mix  the gross margin as a percent of sales was higher in than in as a result of the increase in the use of customer supplied metal 
the net change in volume and product mix shift provided a benefit to gross margin in this was evident in the increased sales to the medical market and sales of various advanced chemical products  which typically generate higher margins 
these benefits were more than offset by higher manufacturing overhead costs  including the costs totaling million incurred by eis  and other factors  which included a net unfavorable inventory valuation adjustment of million that was recorded in the fourth quarter as a result of the reconciliation of the amount of metal on hand with amounts financed 
the gross margin as a percent of sales was lower in than in in part due to the significant increase in the metal price pass through in sales 
sg a  r d and other net expenses totaled million of sales in  million of sales in and million of sales in a full year of eis was the main cause for the increase in expenses in over the expenses incurred by eis in the fourth quarter subsequent to its acquisition contributed to the increase in expenses in over precious metal consignment fees were million lower in than in largely due to lower consignment rates offset in part by an increased quantity on hand 
the consignment fee was million higher in than due to the additional quantities of metal on hand and higher metal prices 
the rates charged by the financial institutions were higher in than in as well 
incentive compensation expense was million lower in than in and million lower in than in due to the differences in performance relative to the plans objectives 
r d costs were relatively flat in compared to after increasing in over in order to support the growth in the business 
corporate charges were million higher in than in and million higher in than in this segment expenses were net of the previously discussed favorable adjustments of the acquisition earn out liability of million in and million in advanced material technologies operating profit was million in  a decline of million from the operating profit of million generated in due to the margin differences from the lower volumes  physical inventory losses  product mix shifts and other factors affecting gross margins and the increase in expenses 
the operating profit in was a million decline from the operating profit of million generated in the margin benefits from the changes in volumes and mix were more than offset by the fourth quarter inventory valuation adjustment  higher overhead costs and the increase in consignment fees and other expenses 
operating profit was of sales in  of sales in and of sales in performance alloys millions net sales operating profit performance alloys manufactures and sells three main product families strip products  the largest of the product families  include thin guage precision strip and thin diameter rod and wire 
these copper and nickel alloys provide a combination of high conductivity  high reliability and formability for use as connectors  contacts  switches  relays and shielding 
major markets for strip products include consumer electronics  telecommunications infrastructure  automotive electronics  appliance and medical  bulk products are copper and nickel based alloys manufactured in plate  rod  bar  tube and other customized forms that  depending upon the application  may provide superior strength  corrosion or wear resistance  thermal conductivity or lubricity 
while the majority of bulk products contain beryllium  a growing portion of bulk products sales is from non beryllium containing alloys as a result of product diversification efforts 
applications for bulk products include oil and gas drilling components  bearings  bushings  welding rods  plastic mold tooling and undersea telecommunications housing equipment 
major markets for bulk products include industrial components and commercial aerospace  energy and telecommunications infrastructure  and  beryllium hydroxide is produced at our milling operations in utah from our bertrandite mine and purchased beryl ore 
the hydroxide is used primarily as a raw material input for strip and bulk products and  to a lesser extent  by the beryllium and composites segment 
sales of hydroxide are also made on a limited basis 
strip and bulk products are manufactured at facilities in ohio and pennsylvania and are distributed internationally through a network of company owned service centers and outside distributors and agents 
sales from performance alloys declined million  or  from million in to million in sales in grew over sales of million in the fall off in performance alloys sales in was largely due to weaker demand for strip products from the consumer electronics and appliance markets 
our materials are used in the early stages of the manufacture of consumer electronics products and our sales to the intermediaries typically are made well in advance of the sale of the ultimate finished product to the consumer 
after a strong first half of  consumer electronics sales softened in the second half of and then remained relatively flat throughout appliance sales declined over in from largely due to the weaker economic conditions in europe 
appliance sales had also declined in from a strong sales to the energy market  predominately bulk products for oil and gas applications  declined in from a strong due to a reduction in the rig count 
energy sales were approximately higher in than in due to the performance characteristics of our products  we remain well positioned in oil and gas applications and we anticipate that sales for these applications will grow once the rig count starts to increase 
the impact of the softer sales to these markets in was partially offset by growth in sales by performance alloys to other key markets  including industrial components and aerospace and automotive electronics 
sales to the industrial component and commercial aerospace market  the largest market for bulk products  grew at double digit rates in and over the respective prior year 
demand for toughmet  a non beryllium containing alloy bulk product  for heavy equipment and other applications continued to grow through market penetration and product development efforts  while demand for traditional alloys for aerospace applications was solid 
sales to the automotive electronics market  primarily in north america and europe  improved slightly in over after growing in over sales over the first nine months of were below the first nine months of but sales in the fourth quarter strengthened due to improving market conditions 
automotive applications for performance alloys include under the hood electronic connectors and other sensors that require a high degree of reliability 
strip product volumes shipped declined in from after declining in from bulk product volumes declined in from  although shipments of non beryllium containing bulk alloys grew and established a record high 
bulk volumes grew in over  largely due to higher shipments of traditional alloys 
average selling prices for strip and bulk products were higher in and than the respective prior years as a result of the implementation of pricing improvement programs 
copper prices were lower on average in than in and the reduced copper price pass through accounted for an estimated million of the decline in sales between periods 
copper prices increased on average in over and accounted for an estimated million of the sales growth in sales of beryllium hydroxide grew in over and in over but remained relatively small at less than of sales in the order entry rate improved in and was higher than sales for the year 
the order entry rate was lower than sales in as order entry levels started the year strong but then slowed down in the second half of the year  primarily for strip products 
the gross margin generated on performance alloys sales was million in  million in and million in gross margin was of sales in  of sales in and of sales in the lower sales volume was the major cause of the million reduction in gross margin in from gross margin was also affected by the increased cost of bertrandite ore 
the ore cost  which is a function of the cost to construct a mine and the quantity of the ore to be excavated from that mine  increased in due to the higher cost to remove the overburden during the construction of our most recent mine 
this higher ore cost coupled with slightly higher extraction mill costs resulted in a million decrease in gross margin in as compared to the negative impact of the lower sales volume and higher ore cost on performance alloys gross margin was partially offset by higher selling prices  improved yields on nickel products and lower manufacturing overhead costs 
during  we improved the yields on certain nickel containing products resulting in lower scrap rates and rework costs and leading to a million increase in gross margin in over manufacturing overhead costs at the elmore  ohio plant site  including rent  depreciation and outside services  were approximately lower in than in the higher selling prices  changes in foreign exchange rates and other factors contributed to improve gross margin in over  but this benefit was largely offset by an unfavorable change in product mix  higher conversion cost in our extraction mill  additional manufacturing costs on nickel products  differences due to the depletion of a lifo layer in and higher overhead costs 
the weaker product mix in was due to a decline in shipments of higher beryllium containing strip products compared to the higher conversion costs at the utah extraction mill in were primarily chemicals and other commodities used for converting the bertrandite ore into beryllium hydroxide 
the aforementioned lower yields on nickel products did not negatively affect sales in  but the associated higher costs resulted in a million reduction in gross margin in as compared to the depletion of a lifo inventory layer resulted in a net benefit to gross margin of million in this benefit did not repeat in or as there were no significant lifo layers depleted in those years 
sg a  r d and other net expenses totaled million in compared to million in the expenses were a slight increase over the total expense of million in expenses were of sales in  of sales in and of sales in the million reduction in expenses in from was largely due to differences in foreign currency exchange gains and losses between years and a reduction in domestic selling expenses 
these reductions were partially offset by higher corporate costs in and a one time litigation gain from a lawsuit against a utility provider over billing rates recorded in r d expenses and incentive compensation costs were relatively unchanged in as compared to r d expenses increased a modest amount in over due to higher activity levels  while foreign currency exchange losses and corporate charges were also higher in than in these increases were largely offset by a reduction in the incentive compensation expense  due to differences in the performance levels against the plan targets between years  and the litigation gain 
selling and administrative expenses were relatively unchanged in from performance alloys operating profit of million was million lower than the operating profit of million earned in the decline in profitability resulted from the lower gross margin due to lower volumes and higher ore costs partially offset by improved pricing  lower overhead costs and other factors net of a reduction in expenses 
operating profit in was unchanged from operating profit was of sales in and and of sales in beryllium and composites millions net sales operating loss profit beryllium and composites manufactures beryllium based metals and metal matrix composites in rod  sheet  foil and a variety of customized forms 
these materials are used in applications that require high stiffness and or low density and they tend to be premium priced due to their unique combination of properties 
this segment also manufactures beryllia ceramic products 
the acquisition of amc provides a complementary family of non beryllium based alloys and composites 
defense and science is the largest market for beryllium and composites  while other markets served include industrial components and commercial aerospace  medical  energy and telecommunications infrastructure 
products are also sold for acoustics  optical scanning and performance automotive applications 
manufacturing facilities for beryllium and composites are located in ohio  california  arizona and england 
beryllium and composites sales were million in compared to million in sales in were lower than sales of million in sales to the defense and science market  which accounted for approximately half of beryllium and composites sales in  declined in from after declining in from sales for defense applications  which include strategic missile defense  optical payloads and advanced lightweight avionic packaging  are affected by government funding delays and budget cuts as well as program timing in a given year 
softer defense sales in were partially offset by improved sales for science applications  including shipments for a nuclear fusion test reactor iter and the large hadron collider in europe 
despite the ongoing pressures on government budgets  based on order patterns and other analyses  we believe the outlook for defense and science applications in is solid 
our materials are designed into applications for sm missile defense system and the eots on the new f fighter jet that are funded for we also anticipate an increase in sales for nuclear science applications in industrial components and commercial aerospace market sales grew in and over the respective prior years 
the growth in was due to the acquisition of amc 
the growth in over was primarily due to increased sales of x ray windows and assemblies for industrial applications  but sales for these applications declined in due to lower demand from a key customer and other factors 
sales of albemet  a metal matrix composite  for applications in semiconductor manufacturing and inspection equipment remained soft in and due to weak conditions in the capital equipment market 
sales of beryllium speaker domes for acoustic diaphragm assemblies grew modestly in and despite weak market conditions and excess downstream inventories 
beryllium unique combination of properties reduces mechanical deformation in sound  shifting the resonant frequencies inherent in other materials outside of the audible range 
our speaker domes are used in high end commercial  entertainment and consumer applications and  while sales remained minor in  we believe that this application represents a long term growth opportunity for our materials 
medical market sales declined in from after declining in from the majority of the decline in was due to lower shipments of beryllia ceramics for medical laser applications while the decline in was largely due to reduced shipments of x ray windows and assemblies 
beryllia ceramic sales for applications within the telecommunications infrastructure market declined in and sales to the energy market  after growing in over  were unchanged in from beryllium and composites gross margin was million of sales in  million of sales in and million of sales in we constructed a new facility at our elmore plant site that is designed to produce pure beryllium metal from beryllium hydroxide that is mined by our utah operations allowing us to significantly reduce our dependency upon external sources for pure beryllium metal 
the operation was placed in service during  but the equipment did not generate the output as planned or designed on a consistent basis 
additional start up costs  maintenance costs and other inefficiencies were incurred to allow for the simultaneous operation of all of the equipment at full production volumes for extended periods of time and the production output levels improved by year end 
improvements were ongoing into the first quarter of the costs and inefficiencies associated with the delay in the start up of the facility reduced margins by an estimated million in in  the start up and inefficiency costs reduced gross margin by an estimated million 
gross margin in benefited from a favorable change in product mix  primarily due to an increase in sales of higher margin beryllium metal products and a decrease in sales of albemet  a metal matrix composite that generates lower margins 
improved pricing on beryllia ceramic products also provided a margin benefit in offsetting these benefits was the negative impact of the slightly lower sales volume and the related lower production volumes 
manufacturing overhead costs increased million in elmore in and  largely depreciation and utilities associated with the new facility 
manufacturing overhead costs at the fremont  california facility also increased  including manpower and outside services 
the change in product mix was unfavorable in as compared to as defense sales  which typically generate higher margins  were lower 
higher operating costs  particularly in the fourth quarter  reduced margins compared to and largely offset the benefit from the yield improvements made on welded products during the lower sales volume in had a minor impact on the decline in margins in from lower production levels at the arizona facility also negatively impacted gross margin in manufacturing overhead costs were million higher in than in partially due to the additional ongoing overhead costs for the new facility in elmore 
overhead costs increased at the fremont facility  primarily salaries and fringe benefits  in order to support the higher business levels there 
total sg a  r d and other net expenses were million of sales in  million of sales in and million of sales in the expenses incurred by amc subsequent to its acquisition were a major cause of the increase in expenses in over r d expenses grew in over after growing in over due to increased activity and various projects 
corporate charges also increased in and over the respective prior year while incentive compensation declined in both years due to the segment performance against the design of the plans 
selling expenses grew in over while differences in other non operating items contributed to the higher expense levels in and beryllium and composites incurred an operating loss of million in and million in in  this segment generated an operating profit of million 
the increased operating loss in was due to the reduced gross margin  caused by the lower sales volume and other factors  and the additional expenses 
the million decline in profitability in from was due to a reduction in gross margin caused by inefficiencies and additional costs resulting from the delay in the start up of the new beryllium facility  additional overhead costs and other factors  and higher sg a expenses 
operating profit was of sales in technical materials millions net sales operating profit technical materials capabilities include clad inlay and overlay metals  precious and base metal electroplated systems  electron beam welded systems  contour profiled systems and solder coated metal systems 
these specialty strip metal products provide a variety of thermal  electrical or mechanical properties from a surface area or particular section of the material 
our cladding and plating capabilities allow for a precious metal or other base metal to be applied in continuous strip form only where it is needed  reducing the material cost to the customer as well as providing design flexibility and performance 
major applications for these products include connectors  contacts  power lead frames and semiconductors while the largest markets are automotive electronics and consumer electronics 
the energy and medical markets are smaller but offer further growth opportunities 
technical materials products are manufactured at our rhode island facility 
technical materials sales were million in  a decline of from sales of million in sales in were million  or higher  than sales of million in sales to the automotive electronics market softened approximately in from largely due to lower sales in europe due to weaker market conditions there 
automotive electronics market sales were strong in  particularly in the first half of the year  having grown over consumer electronics market sales were lower in than in as customers started to phase out of the current design of disk drive arm materials faster than initially anticipated 
we have developed a new design for disk drive applications as well as other applications that offer long term growth potential in this market 
consumer electronics sales were higher in than with a portion of the growth due to an increase in shipments of disk drive arm materials despite shipment levels being disrupted in the fourth quarter by flooding in thailand that affected the downstream supply chain 
sales for solar energy  fuel cells and other alternative energy applications showed solid growth in and due to product and market development activities but softened in due to market conditions 
medical market sales were flat in with and remained minor 
the majority of technical materials product lines showed a decline in sales in  with the largest decline in inlay products 
sales of selective plating products grew in and in while sales of inlay products improved in over the growth in the segment total sales in was partially due to higher prices and changes in product mix 
order entry levels were inconsistent throughout and total order entry was approximately less than sales for the year 
technical materials generated a gross margin of million of sales in  million of sales in and million of sales in the million reduction in the gross margin in was due to the lower sales volume offset in part by a favorable change in product mix 
manufacturing overhead costs were relatively unchanged in as compared to the higher sales volume was the main cause for the million increase in gross margin in over manufacturing overhead costs increased due to higher utility costs  maintenance and other items  but this increase was largely offset by lower inventory provision adjustments 
sg a  r d and other net expenses were million in compared to million in and million in these expenses were of sales in  of sales in and of sales in expenses in this segment were managed in to be relatively flat with the prior year given the softer sales volumes 
a decline in incentive compensation was partially offset by an increase in corporate charges 
the slight increase in the dollar amount of these expenses in over was caused primarily by higher commissions  due to the higher level of sales  and increases in fringe benefits costs and corporate charges offset in part by lower bad debt expense 
technical materials earned an operating profit of million in compared to million in the operating profit was a million improvement over the million of profit generated in operating profit was of sales in and and of sales in international sales and operations we operate in worldwide markets and our international customer base continues to expand geographically due to the development of various foreign nations economies and the relocation of us businesses overseas 
in asia  we have strategically located our facilities in japan  singapore  china  korea  taiwan and the philippines while our european facilities are in germany  the united kingdom and ireland 
our two most recent acquisitions  amc and eis  are based overseas 
our international operations provide a combination of manufacturing  finishing operations  local sales support and distribution services and are designed to provide a cost effective method of capturing the growing overseas demand for our products over the long term 
we also augment our sales and distribution efforts with an established network of independent distributors and agents throughout the world 
the following table summarizes total international sales by region for the last three years millions asia europe rest of world total percent of total sales international sales include sales from international operations and direct exports from our us operations 
the international sales in the above chart are included in the individual segment sales previously discussed 
total international sales improved approximately in over this growth was due to the acquisitions of eis and amc as sales from the existing operations were lower in than in the lower sales to europe in were reflective of weaker economic conditions and the decline in shipments to the appliance market 
international sales grew in over sales to europe improved in in part due to stronger automotive electronics sales  while sales to asia softened partially due to the weaker sales to the consumer electronics market in the second half of the year 
sales from the european and certain asian operations are denominated in their local currencies 
exports from the us and the balance of the sales from the asian operations are typically denominated in us dollars 
local competition generally limits our ability to adjust selling prices upwards to compensate for short term unfavorable exchange rate movements 
we have a hedge program with the objective of minimizing the impact of fluctuating currency values on our consolidated operating profit 
see critical accounting policies below 
legal proceedings one of our subsidiaries  materion brush inc  is a defendant from time to time in proceedings in various state and federal courts brought by plaintiffs alleging that they have contracted chronic beryllium disease or other lung conditions as a result of exposure to beryllium 
plaintiffs in beryllium cases generally seek recovery under negligence and various other legal theories and seek compensatory and punitive damages  in many cases of an unspecified sum 
spouses  if any  often claim loss of consortium 
one beryllium case was filed during and it remained pending as of december  we recorded a reserve of less than million for this case 
there were no settlement payments made for beryllium cases in there were no new cases filed against us during two beryllium cases were pending as of year end  one of which was dismissed and the other was settled for less than million during two cases were settled in at an aggregate cost of less than million 
additional beryllium claims may arise 
management believes that we have substantial defenses in these types of cases and intends to contest the suits vigorously should they arise 
employee cases  in which plaintiffs have a higher burden of proof  have historically involved relatively small losses to us 
third party plaintiffs typically employees of customers or contractors face a lower burden of proof than do employees or former employees  but these cases are generally covered by varying levels of insurance 
although it is not possible to predict the outcome of any litigation  we provide for costs related to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties  and it is possible that some of these actions could be decided unfavorably in amounts exceeding our reserves 
an unfavorable outcome or settlement of a beryllium case or adverse media coverage could encourage the commencement of additional similar litigation 
we are unable to estimate our potential exposure to unasserted claims 
based upon currently known facts and our experience with beryllium cases and assuming collectibility of insurance  we do not believe that resolution of future beryllium proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or cash flow 
however  our results of operations could be materially affected by unfavorable results in one or more of these cases 
regulatory matters 
standards for exposure to beryllium are under review by the united states occupational safety and health administration osha and by other governmental and private standard setting organizations 
one result of these reviews will likely be more stringent worker safety standards 
some organizations  such as the california occupational health and safety administration and the american conference of governmental industrial hygienists  have adopted standards that are more stringent than the current standards of osha 
the development  proposal or adoption of more stringent standards may affect the buying decisions by the users of beryllium containing products 
if the standards are made more stringent and or our customers or other downstream users decide to reduce their use of beryllium containing products  our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the impact of this potential adverse effect would depend on the nature and extent of the changes to the standards  the cost and ability to meet the new standards  the extent of any reduction in customer use and other factors 
the magnitude of this potential adverse effect cannot be estimated 
financial position net cash provided from operations provided from operations was million in as net income and the effects of depreciation more than offset a net increase in working capital items 
cash provided from operations was a strong million in the fourth quarter partially due to the collection of accounts receivable and a reduction in inventory 
in  cash provided from operations was million 
cash used in operations totaled million through the first three quarters of as a result of increases in receivables and inventory  contributions to the domestic pension plan  payment of the incentive compensation and changes in other items 
in the fourth quarter  however  a decline in receivables  coupled with other improvements  resulted in cash flow from operations of million in that period 
in  cash provided from operations totaled million as net income and the effects of depreciation  deferred taxes and other items more than offset increases in working capital  primarily accounts receivable and inventory 
the majority of the working capital build in occurred in the first half of the year as sales levels ramped up from the low levels in as previously noted  changes in the cost of precious and base metals are essentially passed on to customers 
therefore  while sudden movements in the price of metals can cause a temporary imbalance in our cash receipts and payments in either direction  once prices stabilize our cash flow tends to stabilize as well 
working capital cash totaled million as of december   an increase of million from the cash balance of million as of year end cash declined million in as excess cash  coupled with the cash provided from operations  were used to finance the acquisition of eis  capital expenditures  a reduction in debt and the repurchase of shares 
accounts receivable totaled million as of year end  an increase of million  or  from the year end balance of million 
the growth was primarily due to a slowdown in the days sales outstanding dso  a measure of how fast receivables are collected  from approximately days at year end to approximately days at year end the dso of days is within our normal operating range 
the year end accounts receivable balance was million  or  lower than the accounts receivable balance of million as of year end this decrease was due to a combination of changes in the sales volume  as sales in the fourth quarter were lower than sales in the fourth quarter  and a day improvement in the dso 
the expense for accounts written off to bad debts and changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts remained low at million in and million in we have procedures in place to closely monitor our accounts receivable aging and to follow up on past due accounts 
we evaluate the credit position of new customers in advance of the initial sale and we evaluate our existing customers credit positions on an ongoing basis 
we will revise credit terms offered to our customers as conditions warrant in order to minimize our exposures 
credit terms may vary by country based upon local customary practice and competition 
billings for precious metals tend to have tighter payment terms than billings for other products 
advance billings are used from time to time to help reduce credit exposures and speed up the collection of cash 
other receivables were million as of december  compared to million as of december  the majority of the amount due at year end was for reimbursement for equipment purchased under a government contract 
the project was completed in inventories totaled million as of year end compared to million as of year end the inventory turn over ratio  a measure of how quickly inventory is utilized  slowed down during the year 
inventories increased million  or  in over the inventory balance of million as of year end as the turnover ratio slowed down during that year as well 
the inventory increase in was predominately within performance alloys  with only minor changes in inventories within the other segments 
the majority of the increase in inventory was in performance alloys as well 
performance alloys inventory  which totaled million at year end  increased as a result of product mix shifts  growth in various bulk products that have longer processing times  strategic inventory investments and the level loading of production schedules 
inventories at our utah extraction mill and mine  which are part of the performance alloys segment  increased million in over  partially due to higher cost of ore mined 
utah inventories increased million in over due to the cyclical nature of our mining operations and the planned timing of extracting ore and the deployment of our mining resources 
the acquisitions of amc in and eis in contributed a small increase in our total inventory balances in those respective years  while the delayed start up of the beryllium facility in elmore has had a minor impact on the inventory growth in and the majority of advanced material technologies precious metal requirements are maintained on a consigned basis  but its inventories declined slightly in  due primarily to lower business volumes  after growing in the prices for the raw materials we use  particularly precious metals and copper  can be volatile 
the impact of changing prices on our inventory value is minimized by the use of the lifo costing method within our domestic operations 
the lifo method results in the current cost being charged to the income statement and the older costs being used to value the inventory on hand 
see critical accounting policies below 
intangible assets totaled million at the end of versus million at year end the million decline was due to amortization of million offset in part by intangible assets of million acquired with amc 
intangible assets declined approximately million in amortization expense was million while intangible assets acquired with eis and deferred financing costs associated with new debt agreements totaled approximately million 
see note e to the consolidated financial statements 
other long term liabilities other long term liabilities were million as of year end  a decrease of million from year end largely due to the normal amortization of capital lease balances 
other long term liabilities declined million during from the year end balance primarily due to the reversal of the remaining balance of the earn out liability associated with the barr acquisition 
retirement and post employment benefits the long term retirement and post employment benefit obligation was million at year end and million at year end we have a defined benefit pension plan that covers the majority of our domestic employees 
the liability for this plan  which is included in the above totals  was million at year end and million at year end the projected benefit obligation was million  an increase of million from the year end balance of million due to a reduction in the discount rate  the current year expense and other factors 
the market value of the plan assets increased from million at year end to million at year end this million increase in the asset value resulted from contributions of million and investment earnings of million less benefit payments and expenses of million 
the plan assets generated a return of in and a loss of in a portion of our domestic retirees and current employees are eligible to participate in a retiree medical benefit plan 
the plan is unfunded and the liability was million at year end  with million classified as short term and million classified as long term 
the plan liability was million at year end  with million classified as long term and million classified as short term 
the plan expense was million in and million in our subsidiary in germany has an unfunded retirement plan for its employees  while our subsidiary in england has a funded retirement plan 
see note i to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our retirement obligations 
depreciation and amortization depreciation  amortization and depletion expense was million in  million in and million in the primary cause for the decrease in from and the increase in over was higher mine amortization in as a result of mining ore throughout from the new pit that opened late in during  a significant portion of the mining activity centered on opening another new pit as opposed to excavating ore out of the existing pits 
capital expenditures a summary of capital expenditures over the to timeframe is as follows millions capital expenditures mine development subtotal reimbursement for spending under government contract net spending we have a title iii contract with the us department of defense dod for the design and development of a new facility for the production of primary beryllium 
the equipment has been installed and placed in service 
the total cost of this multi year project is approximately million  with the dod providing approximately of the funding  primarily for equipment and a portion of the initial project design costs 
our portion of the project cost includes equipment and the building and other non capitalizable items 
the dod contributions to the project were essentially complete as of year end  but their final share of the cost will be determined based upon their satisfactory review of the project 
additional capital and expense dollars not subject to reimbursement from the dod will be spent in future periods in order to improve efficiencies and to operate at the designed and necessary levels of production 
capital spending on the beryllium facility totaled million in and is included in the million figure in the above table 
spending on this project totaled million in and million in reimbursements from the dod are recorded as unearned income  a liability on the consolidated balance sheet 
see critical accounting policies below for further discussion 
the spending and reimbursement received from the government may differ in a given year due to the normal lag between when the spending occurs and the government issues the reimbursement 
capital spending by advanced material technologies totaled million in  million in and million in major projects in included a new shield kit cleaning operation in new mexico  a new manufacturing work cell approach for precision optics at the westford  massachusetts facility and an expansion and modification to the singapore facility 
performance alloys capital spending  which totaled million in  million in and million in  included upgrades to the casting equipment and extrusion press at the elmore facility  new r d equipment and a vertical continuous caster at the lorain  ohio facility in the capital spending in also included the mine development costs of million 
the mine under construction in should be completed during with ore scheduled to be removed beginning in the second half of the year 
technical materials capital spending in included a new electron beam welding line and an upgrade and conversion of a plating line 
in addition to the new beryllium plant  capital spending within the beryllium and composites segment included spending on a new clean room and various facility modifications 
we also continued work on software upgrades and implementations at various facilities as well as various infrastructure projects during the to timeframe 
capacity expansion projects  including the new beryllium facility  accounted for approximately of the capital spending in  while new technology projects accounted for approximately of the spending 
the balance of the capital spending in was on maintenance capital projects and mine development 
acquisitions in addition to the above capital expenditures  we acquired the following businesses in the to time frame millions year cost acquired goodwill aerospace metal composites limited eis optics limited academy corporation the eis acquisition cost includes million that was paid in as a result of the resolution of valuation adjustments in accordance with the purchase agreement 
the acquisition costs shown are net of cash acquired  if any 
each of these three acquisitions was financed with a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
see note b to the consolidated financial statements 
debt outstanding debt increased from million as of year end to million as of year end the increase was largely due to the net growth in inventory and other working capital items  capital expenditures  the acquisition of amc and the payment of dividends on our common shares 
debt declined million in debt had grown million in the first three quarters of  but then declined million in the fourth quarter despite the eis acquisition due to strong cash flow from operations in that period 
short term debt was million at year end compared to million at year end long term debt was million at december  and million at december  we negotiated a new five year million revolving credit agreement to replace the former million agreement in the third quarter this is a committed facility with sub facilities for revolving loans  swing line loans  letters of credit and foreign currency denominated borrowings 
the agreement contains various covenants  including a leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio 
in  we entered into an million debt agreement with the toledo lucas county port authority and the dayton montgomery county port authority to fund capital expenditures at our ohio facilities 
proceeds totaling million were used during  with the balance of the available proceeds used in the agreement calls for monthly installment payments and a million balloon payment upon maturity in ten years 
we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of december  shareholders equity shareholders equity increased from million as of year end to million as of year end equity increased million in causes for the changes in equity in both years included comprehensive income  share repurchases  option exercises and  beginning in  the payment of dividends on our common shares 
comprehensive income was million in and million in as a result of a change in accounting regulations  beginning in  comprehensive income is presented in a separate financial statement as opposed to being detailed in a footnote 
comprehensive income is net income plus items that are charged or credited directly to shareholders equity  including the cumulative translation adjustment  changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments and adjustments to the pension and other retirement benefit obligations 
our board of directors implemented a dividend program in the second quarter a dividend of per common share was paid in each of the last three quarters of the cash paid to shareholders totaled million in we received million from the exercise of approximately  options in and million from the exercise of approximately  options in we repurchased approximately  shares of our common stock at a cost of million in in  we repurchased approximately  shares of our common stock at a cost of million in these repurchases were made under a share buyback program initially approved by the board of directors in equity was also affected by stock based compensation expense  the tax benefits on stock compensation realization and other factors in both and off balance sheet obligations we maintain the majority of the precious metals we use in production and a portion of our copper requirements on a consignment basis in order to reduce our exposure to metal price movements and to reduce our working capital investment 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
the notional value of the off balance sheet metal was million as of year end compared to million as of year end the higher value was largely due to an increase in quantity on hand 
we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the consignment agreements as of december  contractual obligations a summary of payments to be made under long term debt agreements  operating leases  significant capital leases  pension plan contributions and material purchase commitments by year is as follows millions there after total long term debt non cancelable lease payments capital lease payments pension plan contribution purchase commitments total the revolving credit agreement matures in and the long term debt repayment in includes million borrowed under this agreement 
in the past  we have renegotiated a new agreement prior to the maturity date of the credit agreement and we anticipate that we would do the same in the future 
however  we cannot guarantee that a replacement facility will have similar terms as the existing facility 
see note f to the consolidated financial statements for additional debt information 
the non cancelable lease payments represent payments under operating leases with initial lease terms in excess of one year as of december  the capital lease payments include a building at the elmore site and other material capital leases 
see note g to the consolidated financial statements for further leasing details 
the pension plan contribution of million in the above table represents our best estimate of the contribution to be made to the domestic defined benefit plan as of early given the complexity and number of factors that may affect the contribution levels  it is not practical to estimate contributions to the plan beyond one year 
see the liquidity discussion below 
the purchase commitments of million are for capital equipment to be acquired in based on orders placed with vendors as of december liquidity we believe that cash flow from operations plus the available borrowing capacity and the current cash balance are adequate to support operating requirements  capital expenditures  projected pension plan contributions  the payment of quarterly dividends  share repurchases  environmental remediation projects and strategic acquisitions 
a summary of key data relative to our liquidity  including the outstanding debt  cash balances  available borrowing capacity and the debt to debt plus equity ratio  as of the end of each of the last three years is as follows december  dollars in millions total outstanding debt cash debt net of cash available borrowing capacity debt to debt plus equity ratio debt net of cash is a non gaap measure 
we are providing this information because we believe it is more indicative of our overall financial position 
it is also a measure our management uses to assess financing and other decisions 
the cumulative cash flow provided from operations totaled million in and this two year cash flow was net of contributions to the domestic defined benefit plan of million 
the cash flow from operations during this time period allowed us to fund two acquisitions totaling million  capital expenditures of million net of the reimbursement from the dod  share repurchases of million and dividends of million with only an million increase in debt net of cash 
the increase in debt in resulted in an increase in the debt to debt plus equity ratio from as of year end to as of year end we believe that our cash flow from operations can support this level of leverage  or higher  over the long term 
the ratio also increased as a result of the share repurchases and the dividend payments 
the available borrowing capacity in the table above represents the additional amounts that could be borrowed under the revolving credit agreement and other secured lines existing as of december of each year depicted 
the applicable debt covenants have been taken into account when determining the available borrowing capacity  including the covenant that restricts the borrowing capacity to a multiple of the twelve month trailing earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization and other adjustments 
the reduction in the available borrowing capacity at year end from year end was due to the additional outstanding borrowings and letters of credit and lower profitability in than in our revolving credit agreement  which we renegotiated in  provides a stable borrowing platform with flexible terms and does not mature until as of early in the first quarter  we do not know of any future or pending changes that will cause us to be in non compliance with any of our debt covenants in the near term 
the working capital ratio  which compares current assets to current liabilities  was to at year end  unchanged from year end we intend to pay a quarterly dividend on an ongoing basis  subject to a continuing strong capital structure and a determination that the dividend remains in the best interest of the shareholders 
the dividend payments in averaged approximately million per quarter 
in july  our board of directors re authorized us to purchase up to  shares of our common stock  which represent approximately of our outstanding shares 
the primary purpose of this program is to offset the dilution created through shares issued under stock based compensation plans 
any stock repurchases will be made from time to time for cash in the open market or otherwise  including without limitation  in privately negotiated transactions and round lot or block transactions on the new york stock exchange  and may be made pursuant to accelerated share repurchases or rule b plans 
the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
as of december   we had approximately  shares available to be re purchased under this program 
our domestic defined benefit pension plan is under funded as of year end contributions in future periods will be dependent upon regulatory requirements  the plan funded ratio  plan investment performance  discount rates  actuarial assumptions  plan amendments  our contribution objectives and other factors 
federal legislation enacted during resulted in a reduction in mandatory contributions in the short term from the levels under the previous regulations  but we may elect to contribute funds in excess of the mandatory levels in a given year depending upon our cash flow from operations and other considerations 
as of early in the first quarter  we anticipate contributing approximately million to the defined benefit plan in we also anticipate funding those contributions with cash on hand  cash generated from operations or borrowings under existing lines of credit 
it is not practical to estimate the required contributions beyond at the present time 
in the second quarter  we closed the domestic defined benefit pension plan to new entrants 
current plan participants will continue to accrue benefits under the existing formulas while new hires will be offered an enhanced defined contribution plan 
this action was designed to reduce our pension plan funding requirements in the long term but will have minimal impact on our funding requirements in the short term 
we announced in the first quarter that we were offering a one time opportunity for terminated deferred vested participants in the domestic defined benefit plan the election of a lump sum payment in in lieu of an annuity upon retirement 
we anticipate that the lump sum payments under this election will not exceed million 
the lump sum payments will be made from the pension plan assets during the second quarter and no additional contribution from the company will be required to fund these payments 
portions of our business utilize off balance sheet consignment arrangements to finance their metal requirements 
expansion of business volumes and or higher metal prices can put pressure on the consignment line limitations from time to time 
as a result  we have negotiated increases in the available capacity under existing lines and added additional lines over the last two years 
the available and unused capacity under the metal financing lines totaled approximately million as of december  we have an active environmental compliance program 
we estimate the probable cost of identified environmental remediation projects and establish reserves accordingly 
the environmental remediation reserve balance was million at december  and payments for environmental projects totaled million in and million in environmental projects tend to be long term and the associated payments are typically made over a number of years 
see note j to the consolidated financial statements 
cash on hand does not affect the covenants or the borrowing capacity under our debt agreements 
portions of the cash balances may be invested in high quality  highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from time to time 
ore reserves we have proven and probable reserves of beryllium bearing bertrandite ore in juab county  utah 
proven reserves are the measured quantities of ore commercially recoverable through the open pit method 
probable reserves are the estimated quantities of ore known to exist but have been computed from inspection sites that are farther apart than those used to measure proven reserves 
although the inspection sites are fewer  assurance levels are sufficient to assume ore continuity 
ore dilution of approximately seven percent occurs during the mining process 
the ore is processed at our extraction facility in utah 
approximately of the beryllium in ore is recovered in the extraction process 
we use computer models to estimate ore reserves  which are subject to economic and physical evaluation 
the requirement that reserves pass an economic test causes open pit mineable ore to be found in both proven and probable geologic settings 
proven reserves have decreased slightly in each of the last four years  while probable reserves have remained unchanged over the same time period 
based upon average production levels in recent years and our near term production forecasts  proven reserves would last over seventy five years 
the following table summarizes our proven and probable reserves and the quantity of ore processed over the last five years 
ore reserves classified as possible are excluded from the table 
proven bertrandite ore reserves at year end thousands of dry tons grade beryllium probable bertrandite ore reserves at year end thousands of dry tons grade beryllium bertrandite ore processed thousands of dry tons  diluted grade beryllium  diluted we own approximately of the proven reserves  with the remaining reserves leased 
we augment our proven reserves of bertrandite ore through the purchase of imported beryl ore from time to time 
this ore  which is approximately beryllium  is also processed at the utah extraction facility 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires the inherent use of estimates and management judgment in establishing those estimates 
the following are the most significant accounting policies we use that rely upon management judgment 
accrued liabilities 
we have various accruals on our balance sheet that are based in part upon management judgment  including accruals for litigation  environmental remediation and workers compensation costs 
we establish accrual balances at the best estimate determined by a review of the available facts and trends by management and independent advisors and specialists as appropriate 
absent a best estimate  the accrual is established at the low end of the estimated reasonable range in accordance with accounting guidelines 
litigation and environmental accruals are established only for identified and or asserted claims  future claims  therefore  could give rise to increases to the accruals 
the accruals are adjusted as facts and circumstances change as well as for changes in our strategies or the pertinent regulatory requirements 
since these accruals are estimates  the ultimate resolution may be greater or less than the established accrual balance for a variety of reasons  including court decisions  additional discovery  inflation levels  cost control efforts and resolution of similar cases 
changes to the accruals would then result in an additional charge or credit to income in the period when the change was made 
see note j to the consolidated financial statements 
legal claims may be subject to partial or complete insurance recovery 
the accrued liability is recorded at the gross amount of the estimated cost and the insurance recoverable  if any  is recorded as an asset and is not netted against the liability 
the accrued legal liability includes the estimated indemnity cost only  if any  to resolve the claim through a settlement or court verdict 
the legal defense costs are not included in the accrual and are expensed in the period incurred  with the level of expense in a given year affected by the number and types of claims we are actively defending 
non employee claims for beryllium disease made prior to where any of the alleged exposure period is prior to year end are covered by insurance 
the insurance covers defense costs and indemnity payments resulting from settlements or court verdicts and is subject to a million annual deductible 
in and  defense and indemnity costs were less than the deductible 
pensions 
we have a defined benefit pension plan that covers a large portion of our current and former domestic employees 
carrying values of the associated pension assets and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis using numerous actuarial and financial assumptions 
differences between the assumptions and current period actual results are typically deferred into the net pension asset or liability value and amortized against future income under established guidelines 
the deferral process generally reduces the volatility of the recognized net pension asset or liability and current period income or expense 
unrealized gains or losses are recorded in other comprehensive income oci  a component of shareholders equity 
management  in conjunction with our actuaries  annually review key pension plan assumptions  including the expected return on plan assets  the discount rate  the average projected wage rate increase and mortality levels  against actual results  trends  company strategies  interest rate curves  the current and projected investment environment  industry standards and other regulations and make adjustments accordingly 
the actuaries will make calculations and adjust various assumptions to reflect changes in demographics and other factors  including employee turnover  annually as warranted 
these adjustments may then lead to a higher or lower expense in future periods 
we establish the discount rate used to determine the present value of the projected and accumulated benefit obligation at the end of each year based upon the available market rates for high quality  fixed income investments whose maturities match the plan projected cash flows 
an increase to the discount rate would reduce the present value of the projected benefit obligation and future pension expense and  conversely  a lower discount rate would raise the benefit obligation and future pension expense 
we elected to use a discount rate of as of december  and as of december  our pension plan investment strategies are governed by a policy adopted by the board of directors 
a senior management team oversees a group of outside investment analysts and brokerage firms that implement these strategies 
the future return on pension assets is dependent upon the plan asset allocation  which changes from time to time  and the performance of the underlying investments 
as a result of our review of various factors  we reduced the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption to as of december  from as of december  this change is reflective of management view of the long term returns in the market place as well changes in risk profiles and available investments 
management believes that a long term rate of return of is reasonable 
should the assets earn an average return less than over time  in all likelihood the future pension expense would increase 
investment earnings in excess of would tend to reduce the future expense 
the impact on the pension expense of a change in discount rate or expected rate of return assumption can vary from year to year depending upon the undiscounted liability level  the current discount rate  the asset balance  other changes to the plan and other factors 
if the december  discount rate were reduced by basis points and all other pension assumptions remained constant  then the projected pension expense would increase by approximately million 
if the expected rate of return assumption was reduced by basis points and all other pension assumptions remained constant  the projected pension expense would increase by approximately million 
see note i to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our pension and other retirement plans 
lifo inventory 
the prices of certain major raw materials that we use  including copper  nickel  gold  silver and other precious metals  fluctuate during a given year 
copper prices on average were lower in than in but higher in than in while average precious metal prices increased in and where possible  such changes in material costs  in either direction  are generally reflected in selling price adjustments  particularly with precious metals and copper 
the prices of labor and other factors of production  including supplies and utilities  generally increase with inflation 
portions of these cost increases may be offset by manufacturing improvements and other efficiencies 
from time to time  we will revise our billing practices to include an energy surcharge in attempts to recover a portion of our higher energy costs from our customers 
however  market factors  alternative materials and competitive pricing may limit our ability to offset all or a portion of a cost increase with higher prices 
we use the lifo method for costing the majority of our domestic inventories 
under the lifo method  inflationary cost increases are charged against the current period cost of goods sold in order to more closely match the cost with the associated revenue 
the carrying value of the inventory is based upon older costs and  as a result  the lifo cost of the inventory on the balance sheet is typically  but not always  lower than it would be under most alternative costing methods 
the lifo cost may also be lower than the current replacement cost of the inventory 
the lifo inventory value tends to be less volatile during years of fluctuating costs than the inventory value would be using other costing methods 
the lifo impact on the income statement in any given year is dependent upon the inflation rate effect on raw material purchases and manufacturing conversion costs  the level of purchases in a given year and changes in the inventory mix and quantities 
assuming no change in the quantity or mix of inventory from the december  level  a basis point change in the annual inflation rate would cause a change of approximately million in the lifo inventory value 
deferred tax assets 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we review the expiration dates of the deferrals against projected income levels to determine if the deferral will or can be realized 
if it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferral will not be realized  a valuation allowance would be established for that item 
certain deferrals do not have an expiration date 
we will also evaluate deferred tax assets for impairment due to cumulative operating losses by jurisdiction and record a valuation allowance as warranted 
a valuation allowance may increase tax expense and reduce net income in the period it is recorded 
if a valuation allowance is no longer required  it will reduce tax expense and increase net income in the period that it is reversed 
we had valuation allowances of million associated with state and foreign deferred tax assets as of year end primarily for net operating loss carryforwards 
see note p to the consolidated financial statements for additional deferred tax details 
unearned revenue 
billings to customers in advance of the shipment of the goods are initially recorded as unearned revenue  which is a liability on the balance sheet 
this liability is subsequently reversed and the revenue  cost of sales and gross margin are recorded when the goods are shipped  title passes to the customer and all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
the related inventory also remains on our balance sheet until these revenue recognition criteria are met 
advanced billings are typically made in association with products with long manufacturing times and or products paid with funds from a customer contract with the government 
billings in advance of the shipments allow us to collect cash earlier than billing at the time of the shipment and  therefore  the collected cash can be used to help finance the underlying inventory 
the unearned revenue balance was million as of year end unearned income 
expenditures for capital equipment to be reimbursed under the title iii contract with the government were initially recorded in construction in process 
reimbursements from the government for those expenditures were recorded in unearned income  a liability on the balance sheet 
the total cost of the assets constructed under this contract included costs reimbursed by the government as well as costs borne by us 
the assets were placed in service and capitalized in depreciation expense was calculated and recorded based upon the assets total cost and their useful lives 
the unearned income liability was reduced and credited to cost of sales on a ratable basis with the annual depreciation expense on the associated assets 
the benefit from reducing the unearned income liability in effect reduces the net expense charged to the income statement to an amount equal to the depreciation on the portion of the cost of the assets borne by us 
depreciation and amortization on the consolidated statement of cash flows is presented net of the current period reduction in the unearned income liability 
reimbursements recorded in unearned income for the equipment purchased totaled million 
during  we reduced the liability by million for the ratable offset of the depreciation expense recorded on the assets  leaving a balance of million on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  derivatives 
we may use derivative financial instruments to hedge our foreign currency  commodity and precious metal price and interest rate exposures 
we apply hedge accounting when an effective hedge relationship can be documented and maintained 
the effective portion of the change in a cash flow hedge fair value is recorded in oci until the underlying hedged item matures 
if a hedge does not qualify as effective  changes in its fair value are recorded against income in the current period 
if a derivative is deemed to be a hedge of the fair value of a balance sheet item  the change in the derivative value will be recorded in income and will offset the change in the fair value of the hedged item to the extent that the hedge is effective 
we secure derivatives with the intention of hedging existing or forecasted transactions only and do not engage in speculative trading or holding derivatives for investment purposes 
hedge contracts are typically held until maturity unless there is a change in the underlying hedged transaction 
our annual budget  quarterly forecasts  monthly estimates  customer agreements and other analyses serve as the basis for determining forecasted transactions 
the use of derivatives is governed by policies established by the audit committee of the board of directors 
these policies provide guidance on the allowable types of hedge contracts  the allowable duration of the contracts and other related matters 
hedge contracts are approved by senior financial managers at our corporate office 
the level of derivatives outstanding at a particular point in time may also be limited by the availability of credit from financial institutions 
our practice has been to secure hedge contracts denominated in the same manner as the underlying exposure  for example  a yen exposure will only be hedged with a yen contract and not with a surrogate currency and a silver exposure will only be hedged with a silver and not a gold contract 
we also typically secure contracts through financial institutions that are already part of our bank group 
see note h to the consolidated financial statements and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
outlook the near term outlook for various markets we serve remains solid 
sales for the industrial components and commercial aerospace market have grown  including sales of our toughmet products due to product development and market penetration efforts 
medical market sales have also grown over the last two years and we anticipate further growth in through additional customer and product development programs 
while government defense budgets will continue to be under pressure  we anticipate that sales of beryllium products for defense and science applications will improve in due to program timing  the development of science applications and other factors 
we are well positioned in the oil and gas sector of the energy market and our sales for these applications should grow as the rig count starts to climb 
the growth in consumer electronics sales was disappointing in as the changes in the led sector  downstream inventories and other factors reduced our growth 
the performance characteristics of our materials in electronic applications support the market desire for devices that are smaller and faster with more power and therefore the consumer electronics market has long term growth potential for us 
new product development efforts are an integral part of our sales growth as is leveraging our recent acquisitions 
we are cautious about the condition of the us economy  including the federal government deficit and the ongoing high level of unemployment  and the potential impact the economy may have on our sales and profits 
the european economic situation is also a concern for us  as approximately of our sales in were to europe 
as of early in the first quarter  we are estimating that our sales in should be to higher than sales in the equipment in the new beryllium facility has been installed and is operational 
the continued improvement in productive output  efficiencies and total cost will be a key to an increased level of profitability in precious metal prices on average increased slightly in over and they remain at high levels with a high degree of volatility 
while we typically pass the precious metal costs on to our customers  at higher levels  some customers may investigate alternative pricing arrangements or may design us out in favor of lower priced  lower performing materials 
the higher precious metal prices will also put pressure on our consignment lines 
we will have additional costs in as we complete the facility consolidation program that we started in these additional costs  however  should be offset by the benefits generated by this program in while we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of the defined benefit pension plan over the long term  our pension costs will increase in largely due to the impact of a lower discount rate 
capital spending  which can be affected by our cash flow  new business opportunities  age of our equipment and other factors  is anticipated to be approximately million in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to precious metal and commodity price  interest rate  foreign exchange rate and utility cost differences 
while the degree of exposure varies from year to year  our methods and policies designed to manage these exposures have remained fairly consistent over time 
generally  we attempt to minimize the effects of these exposures on our pre tax income and cash flows through the use of natural hedges  which include pricing strategies  borrowings denominated in the same terms as the exposed asset  off balance sheet financing arrangements and other methods 
where we cannot use a natural hedge  we may use derivative financial instruments to minimize the effects of these exposures when practical and cost efficient 
the use of derivatives is subject to policies approved by the audit committee of the board of directors with oversight provided by a group of senior financial managers at our corporate office 
precious metals 
we use gold and other precious metals in manufacturing various products 
to reduce the exposure to market price changes  the majority of our precious metal requirements are maintained on a consigned inventory basis 
we purchase the metal out of consignment from our suppliers when it is ready to ship to a customer as a finished product 
our purchase price forms the basis for the price charged to the customer for the precious metal content and  therefore  the current cost is matched to the selling price and the price exposure is minimized 
the use of precious metal consignment arrangements is governed by a policy approved by the audit committee of the board of directors 
we are charged a consignment fee by the financial institutions that own the precious metals 
this fee is partially a function of the market price of the metal 
because of market forces and competition  the fee can only be charged to customers in a limited case by case basis 
should the market price of precious metals that we have on consignment increase by from the prices on december   the additional pre tax cost to us as a result of an increase in the consignment fee would be approximately million on an annual basis 
this calculation assumes no changes in the quantity of metal held on consignment or the underlying fee and that none of the additional fees are charged to customers 
to further limit price and financing rate exposures  under some circumstances  we will require customers to furnish their own metal for processing 
customers may also elect to provide their own material for us to process on a toll basis as opposed to purchasing our material 
the available capacity of our existing credit lines to consign precious metals is a function of the quantity and price of the metals on hand 
as prices increase  a given quantity of metal will utilize a larger proportion of the existing credit lines 
a significant prolonged increase in metal prices could result in our credit lines being fully utilized  and  absent securing additional credit line capacity from a financial institution  could require us to purchase precious metals rather than consign them  require customers to supply their own metal and or force us to turn down additional business opportunities 
if we were in a significant precious metal ownership position  we might elect to use derivative financial instruments to hedge the potential price exposure 
the cost to finance and potentially hedge the purchased inventory may also be higher than the consignment fee 
the financial statement impact of the risk from rising metal prices impacting our credit availability cannot be estimated at the present time 
in certain circumstances  we may elect to fix the price of precious metal for a customer for a stated quantity over a specified period of time 
in those cases  we may secure hedge contracts whose terms match the terms in the agreement with our customer so that the gain or loss on the contract with the customer due to subsequent movements in the precious metal price will generally be offset by a gain or loss on the hedge contract 
at year end  we had hedge contracts to purchase and sell gold with a notional value of million 
a metal price decline of from the year end price would result in a net additional pre tax expense of approximately million in this calculation does not take into account the additional net gain that would be recorded on the underlying hedged transactions with the customer 
copper 
we also use copper in our production processes 
when possible  fluctuations in the purchase price of copper are passed on to customers in the form of price adders or reductions 
while over time our price exposure to copper is generally in balance  there can be a lag between the change in our cost and the pass through to our customers  resulting in higher or lower margins in a given period 
we consign a portion of our copper inventory requirements 
the copper consignment arrangements are governed by a policy approved by the audit committee of the board of directors 
as with precious metals  the available capacity under the existing lines is a function of the quantity and price of metal on hand 
should the market cost of copper increase by from the price as of december   the additional pre tax cost to us as a result of an increase in the consignment fee would be approximately million on an annual basis 
this calculation assumes no changes in the quantity of inventory or the underlying fee and that none of the additional fees are charged to customers 
lower of cost or market 
in our manufacturing processes  we use various metals that are not widely used by others or actively traded and  therefore  there is no established efficient market for derivative financial instruments that could be used to effectively hedge the related price exposures 
for certain applications  our pricing practice with respect to these metals is to establish the selling price based upon our cost to purchase the material  limiting our price exposure 
however  the inventory carrying value may be exposed to market fluctuations 
the inventory value is maintained at the lower of cost or market and if the market value were to drop below the carrying value  the inventory would have to be reduced accordingly and a charge taken against cost of sales 
this risk is mainly associated with long manufacturing lead time items and with sludges and scrap materials  which generally have longer processing times to be refined or processed into a usable form for further manufacturing and are typically not covered by specific sales orders from customers 
we did not record any material lower of cost or market charges in or as a result of market price fluctuations while we recorded lower of cost or market charges totaling million in interest rates 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates on portions of our debt and cash balances 
this interest rate exposure is managed by maintaining a combination of short term and long term debt and variable and fixed rate instruments 
we may also use interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate on variable rate obligations  as we deem appropriate 
there were no interest rate derivatives outstanding as of december  excess cash is typically invested in high quality instruments that mature in ninety days or less 
investments are made in compliance with policies approved by the board of directors 
assuming no change in the amount or make up of the outstanding debt as of december   a basis point movement upwards in the interest rates on our variable rate debt would increase our annual interest expense by million 
foreign currencies 
portions of our international operations sell products priced in foreign currencies  mainly the euro and yen  while the majority of these products costs are incurred in us dollars 
we are exposed to currency movements in that if the us dollar strengthens  the translated value of the foreign currency sale and the resulting margin on that sale will be reduced 
we typically cannot increase the price of our products for short term exchange rate movements because of local competition 
to minimize this exposure  we may purchase foreign currency forward contracts  options and collars in compliance with approved policies 
if the dollar strengthened  the decline in the translated value of our margins would be at least partially offset by a gain on the hedge contract 
a decrease in the value of the dollar would result in larger margins but potentially a loss on the contract  depending upon the method used to hedge the exposure 
our current policy limits our hedges to or less of the forecasted exposure 
the notional value of the outstanding currency contracts was million as of december  if the dollar weakened against the currencies we have hedged from the december  exchange rates  the reduced gain and or increased loss on the outstanding contracts as of december  would reduce pre tax profits by approximately million in this calculation does not take into account the increase in margins as a result of translating foreign currency sales at the more favorable exchange rates  any changes in margins from potential volume fluctuations caused by currency movements or the translation effects on any other foreign currency denominated income statement or balance sheet item 
the fair value of the outstanding foreign currency contracts was a net asset of million at december   indicating that the average hedge rates were favorable compared to the actual year end market exchange rates 
utilities 
the cost of natural gas and electricity used in our operations may vary from year to year and from season to season 
we attempt to minimize these fluctuations and the exposure to higher costs by utilizing fixed price agreements of set durations  when deemed appropriate  obtaining competitive bidding between regional energy suppliers and other methods 
economy 
we are exposed to changes in global economic conditions and the potential impact those changes may have on various facets of our business 
we have a program in place to closely monitor the credit worthiness and financial condition of our key providers of financial services  including our bank group and insurance carriers  as well as the credit worthiness of customers and vendors and have various contingency plans in place 
our overall credit lines  including lines for credit  consignment and hedging  have increased over the last two years 
these lines are established with a number of different banks in order to mitigate our exposure with any one financial institution 
all of the banks in our bank group had credit in good standing as of year end the financial statement impact from the risk of one or more of the banks in our bank group dropping our lines due to their insolvency or other causes cannot be estimated at the present time
