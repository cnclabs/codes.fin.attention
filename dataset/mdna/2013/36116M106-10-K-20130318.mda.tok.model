the per gallon blender tax credit expired on december  however  in december  the credit was reinstated retroactive to january  and extended through december  by the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization  and job creation act of the per gallon blender tax credit along with the small agri biodiesel producers tax credit were further retroactively reinstated for and extended through december  by the american taxpayer relief act of signed into law on january  if the per gallon blender tax credit expires  demand for our biodiesel and the price we are able to charge for it may be significantly reduced  harming our revenues  and potentially having a material adverse effect on our biodiesel business 
see risk factors beginning at page below 
the federal government also offers other programs that benefit our biofuels segment  such as the alternative fuel infrastructure credit  the clean school bus program  and the national clean diesel program 
state incentives many states follow the federal government s lead and are offering similar programs and incentives to spur biodiesel production and use 
for example  arkansas offers a tax refund of for each gallon of biodiesel used by a supplier to produce a biodiesel petrodiesel mixture of not more than biodiesel 
in april  arkansas passed legislation that provided for a per gallon biodiesel producer credit and up to  in grants per site for biodiesel producers and distributors to install distribution infrastructure 
the per gallon arkansas producer credit was capped at million gallons of production  or million  per defined time intervals 
we applied for  and received  the credit for time intervals through june  no funding was available for this program in through however  we intend to apply for the credit in future years when and as such credit is available 
our review of state statutes reveals that virtually all states provide either user or producer incentives for biodiesel  several states provide both types of incentives  and more than states provide incentives to biodiesel producers to build facilities in their states  typically offering tax credits  grants  and other financial incentives 
as we expand our business outside of arkansas  we will evaluate these additional state incentives to determine if we qualify for them 
summary we will continue to identify and pursue other legislative incentives to support our business 
however  no assurances can be given that we will qualify for any such incentives or  if we do qualify  what the amount of such incentives will be or whether such incentives will continue to be available 
quality for quality specification purposes  and to qualify for the mandate  biodiesel must meet the requirements of astm d this specification ensures that blends up to b are compatible with diesel engines and associated fuel system hardware 
see status and issues for biodiesel in the united states  national renewable energy laboratory  robert l 
mccormick  teresa alleman  aaron williams  yoshio coy  andrew hudgins  and wendy dafoe  october all biodiesel manufactured at our batesville plant is tested in on site quality control laboratories and confirmed to meet and usually exceed the astm d standard 
the ability of our biodiesel to meet stricter specifications than the industry standards enables us to sell to a broader customer base than our competitors who do not meet those stricter requirements 
commercially available biodiesels can contain small amounts of unreacted or partially reacted oils and fats as well as other minor impurities 
the unreacted or partially reacted oils and fats are called glycerides 
in rare instances the glycerides and other minor components and impurities can clog engine filters 
to address this issue  astm d was amended in february to create two new grades of biodiesel 
grade no 
is essentially the specifications in effect before the amendment 
grade no 
provides for a maximum total monoglyceride content and a maximum cold soak filterability time and in theory would be used where the no 
biodiesel does not operate down to its cloud point 
both grades of biodiesel qualify as biodiesel for purposes of the rfs mandate 
all biodiesel made in our continuous process meets the specifications for no 
biodiesel 
the effect on the market for biodiesel resulting from the existence of two grades is unknown at this time 
the us biodiesel industry created the bq program to address quality issues that arose during the early years of the industry 
this program is run by the national biodiesel accreditation committee  which is a cooperative and voluntary program for the accreditation of biodiesel producers and marketers 
the program is a quality system oriented program that includes standards for storage  sampling  testing  blending  shipping  distribution  and fuel management practices 
since the creation and adoption of the bq program  the quality of biodiesel in the us market has markedly improved 
our plant has operated as a bq accredited production facility since the iso family of standards represents an international consensus on good quality management practices 
it consists of standards and guidelines relating to quality management systems and related supporting standards 
iso is the standard that provides a set of standardized requirements for a quality management system  regardless of what the user organization does  its size  or whether it is in the private or public sector 
it is the only international standard against which organizations can be certified  although certification is not a compulsory requirement of the standard 
our plant is an iso accredited production facility 
renewable identification numbers as noted above  the rfs mandates levels of various types of renewable fuels that are to be blended with us gasoline and diesel fuel by us refiners  blenders  and importers 
renewable identification numbers or rins are the mechanism for ensuring that the prescribed levels of blending are reached 
as ethanol and biodiesel is produced or imported  the producer or importer has the responsibility to report the activity in the usepa s moderated transaction system or emts where a series of numbers ie  a rin is assigned to their product 
assignment is made according to guidelines established by the usepa 
currently  rins are assigned for each gallon of biodiesel produced 
when biofuels change ownership to the refiners  importers  and blenders of the fuel  the rins are also transferred 
the rins ultimately are separated from the renewable fuel generally at the time the renewable fuel is blended 
the refiners  importers  and blenders generally use the rins to establish that they have blended their applicable percentage of renewable fuels during the applicable reporting period 
however  once the rins are separated from the underlying biofuels eg  by blending the underlying biodiesel with petrodiesel  they can also be sold separate and apart from the underlying biofuel 
we create rins with our biodiesel 
if we sell the unblended biodiesel  the rin goes with the biodiesel 
if we blend the biodiesel with petrodiesel in blends of b or less  we can either sell the rins with our blended biodiesel or we sell them separate from the biodiesel 
the decision of whether or not to separate the rins from the blended biodiesel depends on the desires of the customer and whether there is a market for the separated rins and the prices at which they can be sold 
in july when the rfs became effective  biodiesel rins began trading through market makers 
however  please note that no assurances can be given that a separate market for rins will be sustained or what value will be realized upon the sale of biodiesel rins 
byproducts glycerin a byproduct of the biodiesel process is crude glycerin  which is produced at the rate of approximately by mass of the quantity of biodiesel produced 
the rfs mandate will result in excess of million gallons of glycerin being produced by the biodiesel industry in see http www 
benchmarkenergy 
com 
as a result of this influx of glycerin from biodiesel production  us glycerin markets have been and will be significantly affected 
the crude glycerin as generated from biodiesel production is impure and of little economic value 
see http www 
extension 
org pages new uses for crude glycerin from b iodiesel production 
biodiesel producers may sell their crude glycerin to large refineries for upgrading 
however  because of the influx of crude glycerin into the market from biodiesel producers  such producers are receiving only a few cents per pound for this byproduct 
crude glycerin can be refined into a pure form and then used in the specialty chemical  food  pharmaceutical  and or cosmetic industries 
however  because the food  pharmaceutical  and cosmetic industries require usp grade glycerin  some biodiesel producers must seek alternative methods for its disposal 
production of a technical grade of glycerin suitable for specialty chemical applications is less expensive than production of the usp grade required for food  pharmaceutical  and cosmetic applications 
production of a technical grade of glycerin is a potential alternative to the costly disposal of crude glycerin or the relatively expensive purification to a usp grade glycerin 
until the middle of  we primarily utilized the crude glycerin generated in our biodiesel production as a waste fuel to provide a portion of the thermal energy required to operate our plant 
process wastewater streams containing low concentrations of glycerin were and continue to be disposed of in our wastewater treatment facilities 
in mid  we added the capability to partially clean the glycerin ie  remove methanol to make the glycerin suitable for use in certain industrial markets and began selling methanol free crude glycerin in mid any glycerin which is not cleaned continues to be burned as waste fuel or is disposed of in our wastewater treatment facility 
in  the rate of methanol recovery from our glycerin increased  thereby reducing the quantities of crude glycerin burned as waste fuel or treated in our wastewater treatment facilities 
in we plan to produce a high assay industrial grade of glycerin that will have specialty chemical applications 
no assurances can be given that we will be successful in that endeavor 
biodiesel residue an additional byproduct of the biodiesel production process is biodiesel residue 
we utilize distillation columns in our biodiesel production process 
biodiesel residue accumulates in these columns as biodiesel is produced 
we aggregate and sell biodiesel residue to multiple customers 
biodiesel production capacity according to biodiesel magazine  as of december   there were biodiesel plants in existence in the united states 
these plants had a combined annual nameplate production capacity of billion gallons 
an additional plants were under construction with a combined nameplate production capacity of million gallons  for a total built out capacity of billion gallons 
see http www 
biodieselmagazine 
com plants listplants usa existing and http www 
biodieselmagazine 
com plants listplants usa construction 
this is approximately three times the total biodiesel production in and approximately two and a half times more than the federal mandate for the majority of this nameplate production capacity was built to use higher cost crude vegetable oil  usually soybean oil  as its only feedstock 
we believe many of these biodiesel plants were constructed in haste and were either poorly built  built with deficient technology  built in an area with poor logistics  or a combination of the foregoing 
these factors  plus the contraction of the biodiesel industry in and  caused many of these biodiesel plants to fail 
we believe many of the biodiesel plants that shut down may experience difficulty in restarting production due to insufficient working capital  poor logistics that make them less competitive  and a limited ability to run lower cost feedstocks without significant capital improvements 
as such  we do not believe that stated nameplate capacity of all of the biodiesel plants as set forth above is the practical production capacity in the united states  but rather we believe the practical production capacity is substantially less than the stated nameplate capacity 
however  we do not know the amount of the actual practical biodiesel production capacity in the united states 
customers and markets biodiesel and biodiesel blends are currently used in nearly all of the end markets where petrodiesel is used 
most biodiesel in the united states is consumed in the on road diesel fuel market  although some is used for off road purposes such as the farming  residential commercial heating oil  and power generation markets 
we currently market our biodiesel products by truck  rail  and barge directly to customers in the united states 
through the utilization of liquid bulk storage facilities and barge loading capabilities  we are positioned to market biodiesel throughout the united states for transportation and home heating fuel usage 
although the regional market is still being developed  we estimate that the regional direct market available to us at maturity will be at least million gallons per year 
for the twelve months ended december  and  one of our customers represented approximately and of our biofuels revenues and of total revenues  respectively  with the remaining biofuels revenues spread across multiple other customers 
we do not have a contract with this customer  but rather sell on the basis of monthly or short term  multi month purchase orders placed with us by this customer at prices based upon then prevailing market rates 
we do not believe that the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our biofuels segment or on us as a whole in that i biodiesel is a commodity with a large potential customer base  ii we believe that we could readily sell our biodiesel to other customers  and iii the prices we receive from this customer are based upon then market rates 
competition we compete with other producers of biodiesel  both locally  regionally  and nationally 
the principal methods of competition in the biodiesel industry are price  supply reliability  biodiesel quality and rin integrity  ie  the degree of confidence the market maintains in the validty of a biodiesel producer s rins 
the largest producers of biodiesel in the united states in were renewable energy group  inc  archer daniels midland company  louis dreyfus commodities  and ag processing  inc additionally  we compete with numerous other smaller producers  including four biodiesel plants in the state of arkansas and several operating facilities in surrounding states 
in addition to biodiesel producers  we compete with new technologies that are being developed as alternatives to biodiesel 
for example  biotech company ls inc announced that it is producing renewable diesel fuel from e 
coli excrement

uop  a major supplier to the petrochemical refining industry  has also reported the development of technology for the conversion of natural oils and wastes to green diesel  and for producing renewable jet fuel from natural feedstocks 
see http wwwhoneywell 
com honeywell news events case studies nn jet fuel technology 
html c furthermore  the recent emergence of significant new supplies of natural gas in the us  primarily as a result of shale gas development  has increased the awareness of natural gas as a key component of the domestic us energy supply and has lowered natural gas prices 
natural gas use in the transportation sector is likely to increase 
see http mitei 
mit 
edu system files naturalgas executivesummary 
pdf 
inc reased usage of natural gas may lead to declines in the demand for petrodiesel and biodiesel 
we cannot give any assurances that renewable diesel fuel  green diesel  natural gas  or some other product produced by these  or similar  competing technologies will not supplant biodiesel as an alternative to conventional petrodiesel 
the biodiesel industry is also in competition with the petroleum based diesel fuel industry 
the biodiesel industry is small relative to the size of the petroleum based diesel fuel industry and large petroleum companies have greater resources than we do 
without government incentives and requirements  biodiesel would likely be more expensive than petroleum based diesel  making it difficult for biodiesel to compete with petroleum based diesel on price 
supply and distribution as a result of our feedstock flexible process  we are able to source feedstock from a broad supplier base which includes crude corn oil producers and pork  chicken  and beef rendering facilities from both national and regional suppliers 
crude corn oil has been sourced from several national and regional producers 
all feedstocks are currently supplied by either rail or truck 
we believe that an adequate supply of feedstocks can be sourced to support our anticipated production 
we sell biodiesel from our plant site as well as ship it to liquid bulk storage facilities for further distribution 
sales from our plant site are made by railcar and tank truck 
biodiesel is being delivered by company owned tank trucks and common carriers to a liquid bulk storage facility leased by us for distribution there and for further transportation by barge or tank truck 
cyclicality and seasonality biodiesel producers have historically experienced seasonal fluctuations in demand for biodiesel 
biodiesel demand has tended to be lower during the winter in northern and midwestern states due to concerns about biodiesel s ability to operate optimally in cold weather as compared to petrodiesel 
this seasonal fluctuation was strongest for biodiesel made from animal fats and used cooking oils 
biodiesel made from those feedstocks has a higher cloud point which is the point at which a fuel begins to gel than biodiesel produced from vegetable oils such as soybean  canola  or crude corn oil 
this higher cloud point may cause cold weather performance issues 
this historical seasonality appears to be decreasing as biodiesel blends are used in cold midwestern states  like illinois  throughout the year 
the mandate for biodiesel usage as established by rfs may interject an additional seasonal fluctuation in our biodiesel business 
once the mandate for a calendar year is met  or is anticipated to be met  demand for biodiesel may decrease 
such a seasonal fluctuation was experienced in the fourth quarter of  resulting in reduced profitability on biodiesel 
outlook for the biodiesel industry our future strategy prior to  the biodiesel industry had enjoyed significant growth 
however  producers who manufacture biodiesel solely from soybean oil have seen their feedstock costs rise dramatically since as discussed above 
as the relative cost of biodiesel increased due to rising prices of feedstocks among other things  and the blenders credit terminated at the end of with uncertainty at the time about its reinstatement  the production of biodiesel in the united states decreased in and  also as discussed above 
biodiesel production increased again in with the reinstatement of the blenders credit 
the blenders credit expired again at the end of  but was reinstated retroactively for and extended through december  in january of there remains uncertainty as to the long term availability of the blenders credit and the impact this uncertainty will have on the biodiesel industry 
to date  the profitability of our biodiesel has increased as a result of the reinstatement of the blenders credit  but such profitability is not as great as the profitability experienced in given the uncertainty surrounding the blenders credit and the high cost of soybean oil  researchers generally agree that producers who manufacture biodiesel solely from soybean oil have been adversely affected and that the us biodiesel market will transition to larger plants  alternative feedstocks  and second generation technologies  resulting in a consolidation among smaller  first generation producers accompanied by a series of mergers and acquisitions in the field 
we believe that producers who are proactive in responding to these changes can benefit in this emerging market 
these responses include new and improved technologies  alternative feedstocks with higher yields  production scalability and flexibility options  supply chain  distribution  and co location strategies  the sale of rins separate from the underlying biodiesel  and innovative risk management strategies 
see http www 
emerging markets 
com biodiesel index 
html 
our future strategy for our biofuels segment is geared towards these responses 
for example  in  we commercialized two biobased solvents futuresol mme and futuresol glysol  which we are marketing 
in addition  we redesigned our continuous line to produce biodiesel from lower cost feedstock with high free fatty acids 
by the end of  daily production volumes from the redesigned line demonstrated a production capacity in excess of million gallons of biodiesel per year 
debottlenecking has increased the annual capacity to in excess of million gallons per year 
projects are currently in progress to further debottleneck the plant to run at higher rates 
we intend to expand our biodiesel capacity utilizing available facilities as market conditions dictate 
we expect that all future capacity will be operated primarily in continuous processing mode to realize operating economies of scale and optimum throughput 
furthermore  we expect existing and future processes will accommodate a wide range of feedstock oils  allowing optimization relative to supply and pricing 
notwithstanding our future strategy  our continued production of biodiesel may be severely limited  or eliminated entirely  in the event congress eliminates the federal mandate of the rfs see risk factors beginning at page below 
chemicals business segment overview of the segment our chemicals segment manufactures diversified chemical products that are sold to third party customers 
this segment comprises two components custom manufacturing manufacturing specialty chemicals for specific customers  and performance chemicals multi customer specialty chemicals 
chemical products custom manufacturing involves producing unique products for individual customers  generally under long term contracts 
many of these products are produced under confidentiality agreements in order to protect intellectual property 
this is a service based business where customers value dependability  regulatory compliance  technical capabilities  responsiveness  product quality  and process improvement to continually improve costs and reliability 
our custom products are manufactured by continuous production  dedicated batch or general purpose batch mode depending on the volumes required 
our plant s custom manufacturing product portfolio includes products that are used in the agricultural chemical  coatings  chemical intermediates  industrial and consumer cleaning  oil and gas  specialty polymers  and imaging markets 
within this portfolio of products  two large products or product families which are generally produced throughout the year are i a bleach activator for a major detergent and consumer products manufacturer  and ii a proprietary herbicide and intermediates for a major life sciences company 
furthermore  this portfolio also contains a number of additional products most of which are produced intermittently in a batch campaign mode  for diverse customers and end markets 
performance chemicals comprise multi customer products which are sold based upon specification and or performance in the end use application 
this portfolio includes a family of polymer nylon and polyester modifiers and several small volume specialty chemicals and solvents for diverse applications 
in addition  we have recently been successful in growing our performance chemical business through new product development 
new products include a family of acetal based solvents  including diethoxymethane  dimethoxymethane  dibutoxymethane  and glycerol formal  and phenol sulfonic acid 
in we expect this product line will include a high assay  industrial grade of glycerin 
additionally  in this product line may also include multi customer sales of a bleach activator product we have recently began to market 
future strategy to build on and maintain our reputation as a technology driven competitive chemical producer  we believe that we must continuously focus on customer relationship development  cost control  operational efficiency  and capacity utilization to maximize earnings 
the ability to utilize large scale batch and continuous production processes and a continuous focus on process improvements allows us to compete effectively in the custom manufacturing market and to remain cost competitive with  and for some products cost advantaged over  our competitors 
we intend to improve margins in this area of our business by careful management of product mix with regard to size of opportunity  timing to market  capital efficiency  and matching of opportunities to assets and capabilities 
customers and markets our chemical products are used in a variety of markets and end uses  including detergent  agrochemical  automotive  photographic imaging  coatings  nutrition  and polymer additives 
these products are generally non cyclical  however  in the case of our custom manufacturing business  the customers are often the brand owners and therefore control factors related to demand  such as market development strategy 
in many cases  we may be unable to increase or maintain our level of sales revenue for these products 
presently  all sales of the bleach activator are made to the procter gamble company pursuant to a multi year supply agreement that was effective april  and recently extended through see below 
sales of the bleach activator totaled   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
on august   we signed an amendment to our existing agreement with the bleach activator customer 
among other things  the amendment i extended the terms of the agreement to december  unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions of the agreement and ii allows us to sell certain formulations of the bleach activator to third parties as a performance chemical 
we continue to work collaboratively with our customer to assess their future demand which may continue to decline 
all sales of a proprietary herbicide and certain other intermediates used in the production of this herbicide are made to arysta lifescience north america corporation 
sales of this herbicide and its intermediates totaled less than of our revenues in and totaled  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
ostensibly due to increased generic competition  in the customer initiated discussions to  among other things  reduce volumes and or prices of the herbicide and intermediates 
during  the customer reduced its purchase volumes by approximately of levels 
we do not know the volumes of these products which ultimately will be sold to this customer in our contracts with our customer automatically renew for successive one year periods  subject to the right of either party to terminate the contract 
we exercised our rights to terminate these contracts  effective september  for the proprietary herbicide and october  for the intermediates 
we anticipate that we will continue to do business with our customer after those dates provided we can reach mutually acceptable terms 
no definitive agreement has been reached at this time 
none of our other chemical customers represented or more of our revenues from our chemical segment 
competition historically  there have been significant barriers to entry for competitors with respect to specialty chemicals primarily due to the fact that the relevant technology and manufacturing capability has been held by a small number of companies 
as technology and investment have increasingly moved outside of north america  competition from multi national chemical manufacturers has intensified  primarily from manufacturers in india and china 
we compete with these and other producers primarily based on price  customer service  technology  quality  and reliability 
our major competitors in this segment include large multi national companies with specialty chemical business units and smaller independent producers 
the multi national competitors are often disadvantaged by poor responsiveness and customer service  while the small producers often have limited technology and financial resources 
we believe that we are well positioned for growth due to the combination of our scale of operations  technical capabilities  reputation  and financial resources 
supply and distribution specialty chemicals are generally high unit value products sold in packaged  or low volume bulk form  and for which distribution is a relatively minor component of cost 
most products are sold fob the batesville site for distribution globally 
similarly  raw materials for these products are comparatively higher value components that are sourced globally 
an exception will be the biofuels co products  which will be recovered from local processing 
cyclicality and seasonality our chemical products typically are not cyclical but they are sensitive to global economic conditions 
supply and demand dynamics determine profitability at different stages of cycles and global economic conditions affect the length of each cycle 
despite some sensitivity to global economic conditions  many of the products in the chemical segment provide a stable foundation of earnings 
backlog the majority of our revenues are derived under custom manufacturing agreements with specific customers 
these customers generally provide us with forecasts of demand on a monthly or quarterly basis 
these forecasts are intended to enable us to optimize the efficiency of our production processes and generally are not firm sales orders 
as such  we do not monitor or report backlog 
intellectual property we consider our intellectual property portfolio to be a valuable corporate asset which we intend to expand and protect globally through a combination of trade secrets  confidentiality and non disclosure agreements  patents  trademarks  and copyrights 
as a producer of a broad and diverse portfolio of chemicals  our intellectual property relates to a wide variety of products and processes acquired through the development and manufacture of over specialty chemicals during the history of the site 
our primary strategy regarding our intellectual property portfolio will be to appropriately protect all innovations and know how in order to provide our business segments with a technology based competitive advantage wherever possible 
in the chemicals business segment  custom manufacturing projects are primarily conducted within the framework of confidentiality agreements with each customer to ensure that intellectual property rights are defined and protected 
in the biofuels business segment  innovations and process know how will be vigorously protected as appropriate 
as may be necessary  we will seek to license technologies from third parties that complement our strategic business objectives 
neither our business as a whole nor any particular segment is materially dependent upon any one particular patent  copyright  or trade secret 
as the laws of many foreign countries do not protect intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the united states  we can make no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect all of our intellectual property assets 
research and development we devote considerable resources to our research and development programs which are primarily targeted towards three objectives innovating  developing  and improving biofuels processes  in particular biodiesel and other biofuels  including value up technology and applications for co products  developing and improving processes for custom manufacturing products  and innovating  developing  and improving performance chemical products and manufacturing processes 
our research and development capabilities comprise analytical chemistry competencies to assay and characterize raw materials and products  organic chemistry expertise applied across a breadth of reaction chemistries and materials  design and process engineering capabilities for batch and continuous processing of both solid and liquid materials  and proficiency in process safety to design and scale up safe chemical manufacturing processes 
we believe that these core competencies  established in support of the legacy chemical business  are applicable to building a technology based position in biofuels and associated biobased specialty products 
research and development expense incurred by us for the years ended december    and were   and  respectively 
substantially all of such research and development expense are related to the development of new products  services  and processes or the improvement of existing products  services  and processes 
environmental matters various aspects of our operations are subject to regulation by state and federal agencies 
biofuel and chemical operations are subject to numerous  stringent  and complex laws and regulations at the federal  state  and local levels governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
these laws and regulations may require acquisition of permits regarding discharges into the air and discharge of waste waters  place restrictions on the handling and disposal of hazardous and other wastes  and require capital expenditures to implement pollution control equipment 
compliance with such laws and regulations can be costly and noncompliance can result in substantial civil and even criminal penalties 
some environmental laws impose strict liability for environmental contamination  rendering a person liable for environmental damages and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault 
moreover  public interest in the protection of the environment has increased substantially in recent years 
our operations could be adversely affected to the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that imposes environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the biofuels and or chemical manufacturing industry in general 
the following provides a general discussion of some of the significant environmental laws and regulations that impact our activities 
the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act or cercla  and analogous state laws  impose joint and several liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original act  on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the owner and operator of the site where the release occurred  past owners and operators of the site  and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at the site 
responsible parties under cercla may be liable for the costs of cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources 
additionally  it is not uncommon for third parties to assert claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants into the environment 
the federal solid waste disposal act  as amended by the resource conservation and recovery act or rcra  is the principal federal statute governing the management of wastes  including the treatment  storage  and disposal of hazardous wastes 
rcra imposes stringent operating requirements  and liability for failure to meet such requirements  on a person who is either a generator or transporter of hazardous waste or an owner or operator of a hazardous waste treatment  storage  or disposal facility 
many of the wastes generated in our manufacturing facility are governed by rcra 
the federal oil pollution act of or opa and regulations thereunder impose liability on responsible parties for damages resulting from oil spills into or upon navigable waters  adjoining shorelines  or in the exclusive economic zone of the united states 
a responsible party includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility 
opa limits liability for onshore facilities to million 
these liability limits may not apply if a spill is caused by a party s gross negligence or willful misconduct  the spill resulted from violation of a federal safety  construction  or operating regulation  or if a party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in a clean up 
failure to comply with opa s requirements may subject a responsible party to civil  criminal  or administrative enforcement actions 
the federal water pollution control act also referred to as the clean water act imposes restrictions and controls on the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters 
these controls have become more stringent over the years  and it is possible that additional restrictions may be imposed in the future 
permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state and federal waters 
the clean water act provides for civil  criminal  and administrative penalties for discharges of oil and other pollutants  and imposes liability on parties responsible for those discharges for the costs of cleaning up any environmental damage caused by the release and for natural resource damages resulting from the release 
comparable state statutes impose liability and authorize penalties in the case of an unauthorized discharge of petroleum or its derivatives  or other pollutants  into state waters 
the federal clean air act and associated state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources  including facilities involved in manufacturing chemicals and biofuels 
new facilities are generally required to obtain permits before operations can commence  and new or existing facilities may be required to incur certain capital expenditures to install air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals 
federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative  civil  and criminal penalties for non compliance with permits or other requirements of the clean air act and associated state laws and regulations 
the federal endangered species act  the federal marine mammal protection act  and similar federal and state wildlife protection laws prohibit or restrict activities that could adversely impact protected plant and animal species or habitats 
manufacturing activities could be prohibited or delayed in areas where such protected species or habitats may be located  or expensive mitigation may be required to accommodate such activities 
our policy is to operate our plant and facilities in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of our employees and the public 
we intend to continue to make expenditures for environmental protection and improvements in a timely manner consistent with our policies and with the technology available 
in some cases  applicable environmental regulations such as those adopted under the clean air act and rcra  and related actions of regulatory agencies  determine the timing and amount of environmental costs incurred by us 
we establish reserves for closure post closure costs associated with the environmental and other assets we maintain 
environmental assets include waste management units such as chemical waste destructors  landfills  storage tanks  and boilers 
when these types of assets are constructed or installed  a reserve is established for the future costs anticipated to be associated with the closure of the site based on the expected life of the environmental assets  the applicable regulatory closure requirements  and our environmental policies and practices 
these expenses are charged into earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets 
currently  we estimate the useful life of each individual asset up to years 
in addition to our general environmental policies and policies for asset retirement obligations and environmental reserves  we accrue environmental costs when it is probable that we have incurred a liability and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
in some instances  the amount cannot be reasonably estimated due to insufficient data  particularly in the nature and timing of the future performance 
in these cases  the liability is monitored until such time that sufficient data exists 
with respect to a contaminated site  the amount accrued reflects our assumptions about remedial requirements at the site  the nature of the remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 
changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based  unanticipated government enforcement action  or changes in health  safety  environmental  chemical control regulations  and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs 
our cash expenditures related to environmental protection and improvement were approximately   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
these amounts pertain primarily to operating costs associated with environmental protection equipment and facilities  but also include expenditures for construction and development 
while we do not expect future environmental capital expenditures arising from requirements of environmental laws and regulations to materially increase our planned level of annual capital expenditures for environmental control facilities  we can give no assurances that such requirements will not materialize in the future 
we believe that we have obtained in all material respects the necessary environmental permits and licenses to carry on our operations as presently conducted 
we have reviewed environmental investigations of the properties owned by us and believe  on the basis of the results of the investigations carried out to date  that there are no material environmental issues which adversely impact us 
in connection with the acquisition of our warehouse in batesville  the seller agreed to remediate certain environmental conditions existing at the facility on the date that we acquired it and to indemnify us with respect to those environmental conditions 
management team and workforce our executive management team at our batesville plant consists of individuals with a combined plus years of experience in the chemicals industry  comprising technical  operational  and business responsibilities 
the members of the executive team also have international experience  including assignments in europe and asia 
the operational and commercial management group at the batesville site includes additional degreed professionals with an average experience of over years in the chemical industry 
our batesville workforce comprises approximately full time employees  and includes degreed professionals including chemists and phds and engineers including licensed professional engineers and chemical engineers 
operations personnel have received extensive training and are highly skilled 
additionally  all site manufacturing and infrastructure is fully automated and computer controlled 
the workforce is substantially self sufficient in the range of required operational skills and experience due to the lack of locally available process industry infrastructure 
voluntary attrition at the site has averaged annually since we believe that we have good relations with our employees

item a 
risk factors 
an investment in us involves a high degree of risk and may result in the loss of all or part of your investment 
you should consider carefully all of the information set out in this document and the risks attaching to an investment in us  including  in particular  the risks described below 
the information below does not purport to be an exhaustive list and should be considered in conjunction with the contents of the rest of this document 
risks associated with our business activities the federal excise tax credit for biodiesel will expire on december  and congress has not enacted legislation to extend this credit 
if the credit is not renewed  our cost of producing biodiesel will be increased or our selling price could decrease  which could have an adverse effect on our financial position 
in october  congress passed a biodiesel tax incentive  structured as a federal excise tax credit  as part of the american jobs creation act of the credit amounted to one cent for each percentage point of vegetable oil or animal fat biodiesel that was blended with petrodiesel and one half cent for each percentage point of recycled oils and other non agricultural biodiesel  subsequently amended and increased to one cent 
for example  blenders that blended b made from soy  canola  and other vegetable oils and animal fats received a per gallon excise tax credit 
the tax incentive generally was taken by petroleum distributors and was passed on to the consumer 
it was designed to lower the cost of biodiesel to consumers in both taxable and tax exempt markets 
the tax credit was scheduled to expire at the end of  but was extended in the energy policy act of to december  the emergency economic stabilization act of extended the biodiesel tax credit through december  and qualified all biodiesel for a per gallon tax credit  including biodiesel made from non virgin feedstocks such as yellow grease 
most recently  the biodiesel tax credit was extended to december  congress has not enacted any legislation to extend this tax credit beyond december  and it expires at that time 
if biodiesel feedstock costs do not decrease significantly relative to biodiesel prices  we could realize a negative gross margin on biodiesel 
as a result  we could cease producing biodiesel  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
our biofuels operations may be harmed if the government were to change current laws and regulations 
alternative fuels businesses benefit from government subsidies and mandates 
if any of the state or federal laws and regulations relating to the government subsidies and mandates change  including an expiration of the per gallon federal biodiesel blenders tax credit  the ability to recover capital expenditures from our alternative fuels business could be harmed 
our biofuels platform is subject to federal  state  and local laws and regulations governing the application and use of alternative energy products  including those related specifically to biodiesel 
for instance  biodiesel products benefit from being the only alternative fuel certified by the usepa that fulfills the requirements of section b of the clean air act 
if agency determinations  laws  and regulations relating to the application and use of alternative energy are changed  the marketability and sales of biodiesel production could be materially adversely affected 
the industries in which we compete are highly competitive 
the biodiesel and specialty chemical industries are highly competitive 
there is competition within these industries and also with other industries in supplying the energy  fuel  and chemical needs of industry and individual customers 
we compete with other firms in the sale or purchase of various goods or services in many national and international markets 
we compete with large national and multi national companies that have longer operating histories  greater financial  technical  and other resources  and greater name recognition than we do 
in addition  we compete with several smaller companies capable of competing effectively on a regional or local basis  and the number of these smaller companies is increasing 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and services and changes in customer requirements 
as a result of competition  we may lose market share or be unable to maintain or increase prices for our products and or services or to acquire additional business opportunities  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
although we will employ all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate for such purposes  no assurances can be made that they will be successful 
a key component of our competitive position  particularly given the expected commodity based nature of many of our products  will be our ability to manage expenses successfully  which requires continuous management focus on reducing unit costs and improving efficiency 
no assurances can be given that we will be able to successfully manage such expenses 
our competitive position in the markets in which we participate is  in part  subject to external factors in addition to those that we can impact 
natural disasters  changes in laws or regulations  war or other outbreak of hostilities  or other political factors in any of the countries or regions in which we operate or do business  or in countries or regions that are key suppliers of strategic raw materials  could negatively impact our competitive position and our ability to maintain market share 
as to our biofuels segment  biodiesel produced in canada  south america  europe  eastern asia  the pacific rim  or other regions may be imported into the united states to compete with us produced biodiesel 
these regions may benefit from biodiesel production incentives or other financial incentives in their home countries that offset some of their biodiesel production costs and enable them to profitably sell biodiesel in the us at lower prices than us based biodiesel producers 
under the rfs  imported biodiesel may be eligible to satisfy an obligated party s requirements and therefore may compete to meet the volumetric requirements of rfs this could make it more challenging for us to market or sell biodiesel in the united states  which would have a material adverse effect on our revenues 
the european commission has imposed anti dumping and countervailing duties on biodiesel blends imported into europe  which have effectively eliminated our ability to sell those biodiesel blends in europe 
in march  as a response to the federal blenders tax credit  the european commission imposed anti dumping and anti subsidy tariffs on biodiesel produced in the united states 
these tariffs have effectively eliminated european demand for b or higher blends imported from the united states 
the european commission extended these tariffs through in may  the european commission imposed similar anti dumping and countervailing duties on biodiesel blends below b these duties significantly increase the price at which we and other united states biodiesel producers will be able to sell such biodiesel blends in european markets  making it difficult or impossible to compete in the european biodiesel market 
these anti dumping and countervailing duties therefore decrease the demand for biodiesel produced in the united states and increase the supply of biodiesel available in the united states market 
such market dynamics may negatively impact our revenues and profitability 
fluctuations in commodity prices may cause a reduction in the demand or profitability of the products or services we produce 
prices for alternative fuels tend to fluctuate widely based on a variety of political and economic factors 
these price fluctuations heavily influence the oil and gas industry 
lower energy prices for existing products tend to limit the demand for alternative forms of energy services and related products and infrastructure 
historically  the markets for alternative fuels have been volatile  and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
wide fluctuations in alternative fuel prices may result from relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty  and other factors that are beyond our control  including worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and gas  the price and or availability of biodiesel feedstocks  weather conditions  the level of consumer demand  the price and availability of alternative fuels  the availability of pipeline and refining capacity  the price and level of foreign imports  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes  the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls  political instability or armed conflict in oil producing regions  and the overall economic environment 
these factors and the volatility of the commodity markets make it extremely difficult to predict future alternative fuel price movements with any certainty 
there may be a decrease in the demand for our products or services and our profitability could be adversely affected 
we are reliant on certain strategic raw materials for our operations 
we are reliant on certain strategic raw materials such as acetic anhydride  pelargonic acid  biodiesel feedstocks  and methanol for our operations 
we have implemented certain risk management tools  such as multiple suppliers and hedging  as appropriate  to mitigate short term market fluctuations in raw material supply and costs 
there can be no assurance  however  that such measures will result in cost savings or supply stability or that all market fluctuation exposure will be eliminated 
in addition  natural disasters  changes in laws or regulations  war or other outbreak of hostilities  or other political factors in any of the countries or regions in which we operate or do business  or in countries or regions that are key suppliers of strategic raw materials  could affect availability and costs of raw materials 
while temporary shortages of raw materials may occasionally occur  these items have historically been sufficiently available to cover current requirements 
however  their continuous availability and price are impacted by natural disasters  plant interruptions occurring during periods of high demand  domestic and world market and political conditions  changes in government regulation  and war or other outbreak of hostilities 
in addition  as we increase our biodiesel capacity  we will require larger supplies of raw materials which have not yet been secured and may not be available for the foregoing reasons  or may be available only at prices higher than current levels 
our operations or products may  at times  be adversely affected by these factors 
we are reliant upon a relatively small number of customers 
all sales of the bleach activator are made to the procter gamble company and totaled   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
this customer represented approximately of our revenues for the year ended december  the loss of this company as customer would have a material adverse effect on us 
on august   we signed an amendment to our existing agreement 
among other things  the amendment i extended the term of the agreement to december  unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions of the agreement  and ii allows us to sell certain formulations of the bleach activator to third parties as a performance chemical 
revenues from the bleach activator decreased in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  we continue to work collaboratively with the procter gamble company to assess their future demand  which demand may continue to decline 
additionally  sales of biodiesel to one customer represented approximately of our biofuels revenues of total revenues for the year ended december  we do not have a contract with this customer  but rather sell on the basis of monthly or short term  multi month purchase orders placed with us by this customer at prices based upon then prevailing market rates 
changes in technology may render our products or services obsolete 
the alternative fuel and chemical industries may be substantially affected by rapid and significant changes in technology 
examples include competitive product technologies  such as green gasoline and renewable diesel produced from catalytic hydroforming of renewable feedstock oils and competitive process technologies such as advanced biodiesel continuous reactor and washing designs that increase throughput 
additionally  new supplies of natural gas in the us  primarily as a result of shale gas development  have lowered natural gas prices 
lower natural gas prices may lead to increased use of natural gas as a transportation fuel 
increased usage of natural gas in the transportation market  or other markets which have traditionally utilized petrodiesel or biodiesel  may lead to declines in the demand for petrodiesel and biodiesel 
these changes may render obsolete certain existing products  energy sources  services  and technologies currently used by us 
we cannot assure you that the technologies used by or relied upon by us will not be subject to such obsolescence 
while we may attempt to adapt and apply the services provided by us to newer technologies  we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to fund these changes or that these changes will ultimately prove successful 
failure to comply with governmental regulations could result in the imposition of penalties  fines  or restrictions on operations and remedial liabilities 
the biofuel and chemical industries are subject to extensive federal  state  local  and foreign laws and regulations related to the general population s health and safety and those associated with compliance and permitting obligations including those related to the use  storage  handling  discharge  emission  and disposal of municipal solid waste and other waste  pollutants or hazardous substances or waste  or discharges and air and other emissions as well as land use and development 
existing laws also impose obligations to clean up contaminated properties or to pay for the cost of such remediation  often upon parties that did not actually cause the contamination 
compliance with these laws  regulations  and obligations could require substantial capital expenditures 
failure to comply could result in the imposition of penalties  fines  or restrictions on operations and remedial liabilities 
these costs and liabilities could adversely affect our operations 
changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently  and any changes that result in more stringent or costly waste handling  storage  transport  disposal  or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business segments in general and on our results of operations  competitive position  or financial condition 
we are unable to predict the effect of additional environmental laws and regulations which may be adopted in the future  including whether any such laws or regulations would materially adversely increase our cost of doing business or affect our operations in any area 
under certain environmental laws and regulations  we could be held strictly liable for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or contamination  or if current or prior operations were conducted consistent with accepted standards of practice 
such liabilities can be significant and  if imposed  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
market conditions or transportation impediments may hinder access to raw goods and distribution markets 
market conditions  the unavailability of satisfactory transportation  or the location of our manufacturing complex from more lucrative markets may hinder our access to raw goods and or distribution markets 
the availability of a ready market for biodiesel depends on a number of factors  including the demand for and supply of biodiesel and the proximity of the plant to trucking and terminal facilities 
the sale of large quantities of biodiesel necessitates that we transport our biodiesel to other markets since the batesville  arkansas regional market is not expected to absorb all of our contemplated production 
currently  common carrier pipelines are not transporting biodiesel or biodiesel petrodiesel blends 
this leaves trucks  barges  and rail cars as the means of distribution of our product from the plant to these storage terminals for further distribution 
however  the current availability of rail cars is limited and at times unavailable because of repairs or improvements  or as a result of priority transportation agreements with other shippers 
additionally  the current availability of barges is limited  particularly heated barges to transport biodiesel during winter months 
if transportation is restricted or is unavailable  we may not be able to sell into more lucrative markets and consequently our cash flow from sales of biodiesel could be restricted 
the biodiesel industry also faces several challenges to wide biodiesel acceptance  including cold temperature limitations  storage stability  fuel quality standards  and exhaust emissions 
if the industry does not satisfy consumers that these issues have been resolved or are being resolved  biodiesel may not gain widespread acceptance which may have an adverse impact on our cash flow from sales of biodiesel 
our insurance may not protect us against our business and operating risks 
we maintain insurance for some  but not all  of the potential risks and liabilities associated with our business 
for some risks  we may not obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented 
as a result of market conditions  premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and  in some instances  certain insurance policies may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage 
as a result  we may not be able to renew our existing insurance policies or procure other desirable insurance on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
although we will maintain insurance at levels we believe are appropriate for our business and consistent with industry practice  we will not be fully insured against all risks which cannot be sourced on economic terms 
in addition  pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable 
losses and liabilities from uninsured and underinsured events and delay in the payment of insurance proceeds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if a significant accident or other event resulting in damage to our operations including severe weather  terrorist acts  war  civil disturbances  pollution  or environmental damage occurs and is not fully covered by insurance or a recoverable indemnity from a customer  it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on key personnel  the loss of any of whom could materially adversely affect our future operations 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our executive officers 
the loss of the services of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on us 
our business is also dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
acquiring or retaining these personnel could prove more difficult to hire or cost substantially more than estimated 
this could cause us to incur greater costs 
if we are unable to effectively manage the commodity price risk of our raw materials or finished goods  we may have unexpected losses 
we hedge our raw materials and or finished products for our biofuels segment to some degree to manage the commodity price risk of such items 
this requires the purchase or sale of commodity futures contracts and or options on those contracts or similar financial instruments 
we may be forced to make cash deposits available to counterparties as they mark to market these financial hedges 
this funding requirement may limit the level of commodity price risk management that we are prudently able to complete 
if we do not manage or are not capable of managing the commodity price risk of our raw materials and or finished products for our biofuels segment  we may incur losses as a result of price fluctuations with respect to these raw materials and or finished products 
in most cases we are not capable of hedging raw material and or finished products for our chemicals segment 
certain of our products are produced under manufacturing agreements with our customers which provide us the contractual ability to pass along raw material price increases 
however  we do not have this protection for all product lines within the chemicals segment 
if we do not manage or are not capable of managing escalating raw material prices and or passing these increases along to our customers via prices for our finished products  we may incur losses 
if we are unable to acquire or renew permits and approvals required for our operations  we may be forced to suspend or cease operations altogether 
the operation of our manufacturing plant requires numerous permits and approvals from governmental agencies 
we may not be able to obtain or renew all necessary permits or modifications thereto and approvals and  as a result  our operations may be adversely affected 
in addition  obtaining all necessary renewal permits or modifications to existing permits and approvals for future expansions may necessitate substantial expenditures and may create a significant risk of expensive delays or loss of value if a project is unable to function as planned due to changing requirements 
our indebtedness may limit our ability to borrow additional funds or capitalize on acquisition or other business opportunities 
we have entered into a million revolving credit facility with a commercial bank 
although as of the date of this report we have no outstanding borrowings under this facility  when we do borrow the restrictions governing this indebtedness such as total debt to ebitda limitations could reduce our ability to incur additional indebtedness  engage in certain transactions  or capitalize on acquisition or other business opportunities 
we expect to have capital expenditure requirements  and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms 
we expect to make capital expenditures for the expansion of our biofuels and chemicals production capacity and complementary infrastructure 
we intend to finance these capital expenditures primarily through cash flow from our operations  borrowings under our credit facility  and existing cash 
however  if our capital requirements vary materially from those provided for in our current projections  we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated 
a decrease in expected revenues or adverse change in market conditions could make obtaining this financing economically unattractive or impossible 
as a result  we may lack the capital necessary to complete the projected expansions or capitalize on other business opportunities 
we may be unable to successfully integrate future acquisitions with our operations or realize all of the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions 
failure to successfully integrate future acquisitions  if any  in a timely manner may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
the difficulties of combining acquired operations include  among other things operating a significantly larger combined organization  consolidating corporate technological and administrative functions  integrating internal controls and other corporate governance matters  and diverting management s attention from other business concerns 
in addition  we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from future acquisitions  such as increased earnings  cost savings  and revenue enhancements  for various reasons  including difficulties integrating operations and personnel  higher and unexpected acquisition and operating costs  unknown liabilities  and fluctuations in markets 
if benefits from future acquisitions do not meet the expectations of financial or industry analysts  the market price of our shares of common stock may decline 
if we are unable to respond to changes in astm or customer standards  our ability to sell biodiesel may be harmed 
we currently produce biodiesel to conform to or exceed standards established by astm 
astm standards for biodiesel and biodiesel blends may be modified in response to new observations from the industries involved with diesel fuel 
new tests or more stringent standards may require us to make additional capital investments in  or modify  plant operations to meet these standards 
in addition  some biodiesel customers have developed their own biodiesel standards which are stricter than the astm standards 
if we are unable to meet new astm standards or our biodiesel customers standards cost effectively or at all  our production technology may become obsolete  and our ability to sell biodiesel may be harmed  negatively impacting our revenues and profitability 
if we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting  we might not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud  in that case  our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which would harm our business and could negatively impact the value of our stock 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud 
the process of maintaining our internal controls may be expensive and time consuming and may require significant attention from management 
although we have concluded as of december  that our internal control over financial reporting provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap  because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect fraud or misstatements 
failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
if we or our independent registered public accounting firm discover a material weakness  the disclosure of that fact could harm the value of our stock and our business 
confidentiality agreements with customers  employees  and others may not adequately prevent disclosures of confidential information  trade secrets  and other proprietary information 
we rely in part on trade secret protection to protect our confidential and proprietary information and processes 
however  trade secrets are difficult to protect 
we have taken measures to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information  but these measures may not be effective 
for example  we require new custom manufacturing chemical customers to execute confidentiality agreements before we begin manufacturing custom chemicals for them 
we also require employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment or consulting arrangement with us 
these agreements generally require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties 
these agreements also generally provide that know how and inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us are our exclusive property 
nevertheless  these agreements may be breached  or may not be enforceable  and our proprietary information may be disclosed 
further  despite the existence of these agreements  third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques 
accordingly  it may be difficult for us to protect our trade secrets 
costly and time consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights  and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position 
moreover  we cannot assure you that our technology does not infringe upon any valid claims of patents that other parties own 
in the future  if we were found to be infringing on a patent owned by a third party  we might have to seek a license from such third party to use the patented technology 
we cannot assure you that  if required  we would be able to obtain such a license on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if a third party brought a legal action against us or our licensors  we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves  and we cannot assure you that such an action would be resolved in our favor 
if such a dispute were to be resolved against us  we could be subject to significant damages 
we depend on our ability to maintain relationships with industry participants  including our strategic partners 
our ability to maintain commercial arrangements with chemical and biodiesel customers  raw material and feedstock suppliers  and transportation and logistics services providers may depend on maintaining close working relationships with industry participants 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or establish additional necessary strategic relationships  in which case the opportunity to grow our business may be negatively affected 
if automobile manufacturers and other industry groups express reservations regarding the use of biodiesel  our ability to sell biodiesel will be negatively impacted 
because it is a relatively new product  research on biodiesel use in automobiles is ongoing 
some industry groups have recommended that blends of no more than biodiesel be used for automobile fuel due to concerns about fuel quality  engine performance problems  and possible detrimental effects of biodiesel on rubber components and other engine parts 
although some manufacturers have encouraged use of biodiesel fuel in their vehicles  cautionary pronouncements by other manufacturers or industry groups may impact our ability to market our biodiesel 
there is currently excess production capacity and low utilization in the biodiesel industry and if non operational and underutilized facilities commence or increase operations  our results of operations may be negatively affected 
many biodiesel plants in the united states do not currently operate  and of those that do  many do not operate at full capacity 
further  plants under construction and expansion in the united states as of december  if completed  would add additional biodiesel production capacity 
the annual production capacity of existing plants and plants under construction far exceeds both historic consumption of biodiesel in the united states and required consumption under rfs if this excess production capacity was utilized for biodiesel production  it would increase competition for our feedstocks  increase the volume of biodiesel on the market  and may reduce biodiesel gross margins  harming our revenues and profitability 
perception about food vs 
fuel could impact public policy which could impair our ability to operate at a profit and substantially harm our revenues and operating margins 
some people believe that biodiesel may increase the cost of food  as some feedstocks such as soybean oil used to make biodiesel can also be used for food products 
this debate is often referred to as food vs 
fuel 
this is a concern to the biodiesel industry because biodiesel demand is heavily influenced by government policy and  if public opinion were to erode  it is possible that these policies would lose political support 
these views could also negatively impact public perception of biodiesel 
such claims have led some  including members of congress  to urge the modification of current government policies which affect the production and sale of biofuels in the united states 
concerns regarding the environmental impact of biodiesel production could affect public policy which could impair our ability to operate at a profit and substantially harm our revenues and operating margins 
because biodiesel is a new product  the environmental impacts associated with biodiesel production and use have not yet been fully analyzed 
under the energy independence and security act  the usepa is required to produce a study every three years of the environmental impacts associated with current and future biofuel production and use  including effects on air and water quality  soil quality and conservation  water availability  energy recovery from secondary materials  ecosystem health and biodiversity  invasive species  and international impacts 
a draft of the first such triennial report was released in january and a final report was submitted to congress on january  the report concluded the following i the extent of negative impacts to date due to the biofuels industry is limited in magnitude and primarily associated with intensification of corn production  ii future negative or positive impacts will be determined by the choice of feedstock  land use change  cultivation and conservation practices  and iii potential benefits will likely require implementation of conservation measures and innovative technologies  best management practices  and improvements in production efficiency 
these factors  along with any negative findings or interpretations of this report or subsequent reports  may negatively impact public perception of biodiesel  its acceptance and development as an alternative fuel  and its political support 
to the extent that state or federal laws are modified or public perception turns against biodiesel  use requirements such as rfs may not continue  which could materially harm our ability to operate profitably 
growth in the sale and distribution of biodiesel is dependent on the expansion of related infrastructure which may not occur on a timely basis  if at all  and our operations could be adversely affected by infrastructure limitations or disruptions 
growth in the biodiesel industry depends on substantial development of infrastructure for the distribution of biodiesel 
substantial investment required for these infrastructure changes and expansions may not be made on a timely basis or at all 
the scope and timing of any infrastructure expansion are generally beyond our control 
also  we compete with other biofuel companies for access to some of the key infrastructure components such as pipeline and terminal capacity 
as a result  increased production of biodiesel or other biofuels will increase the demand and competition for necessary infrastructure 
any delay or failure in expanding distribution infrastructure could hurt the demand for or prices of biodiesel  impede delivery of our biodiesel  and impose additional costs  each of which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our business will be dependent on the continuing availability of infrastructure for the distribution of increasing volumes of biodiesel and any infrastructure disruptions could materially harm our business 
nitrogen oxide emissions from biodiesel may harm its appeal as a renewable fuel and increase costs 
in some instances biodiesel may increase emissions of nitrogen oxide as compared to petrodiesel  which could harm air quality 
nitrogen oxide is a contributor to ozone and smog 
these emissions may decrease the appeal of biodiesel to environmental groups and agencies who have been historic supporters of the biodiesel industry  potentially harming our ability to market our biodiesel 
in addition  several states have acted to regulate potential nitrogen oxide emissions from biodiesel 
texas currently requires that biodiesel blends contain an additive to eliminate this perceived nitrogen oxide increase 
california is in the process of formulating biodiesel regulations that may also require such an additive 
in states where such an additive is required to sell biodiesel  the additional cost of the additive may make biodiesel less profitable or make biodiesel less cost competitive against petrodiesel or renewable diesel  which would negatively impact our ability to sell our products in such states and therefore have an adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
several biofuels companies throughout the united states have filed for bankruptcy over the last several years due to industry and economic conditions 
unfavorable worldwide economic conditions  lack of financing  and volatile biofuel prices and feedstock costs have likely contributed to the necessity of bankruptcy filings by biofuel producers 
our business may be negatively impacted by the industry conditions that influenced the bankruptcy proceedings of other biofuel producers  or we may encounter new competition from buyers of distressed biodiesel properties who enter the industry at a lower cost than original plant investors 
we are exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in market values of our investments we could experience significant declines in the market value of our investment portfolio 
credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively affected by liquidity  credit deterioration  financial results  economic risk  political risk  sovereign risk  or other factors 
as a result  the value and liquidity of our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities could decline and result in significant impairment 
risks associated with owning our shares if our founding shareholders and mr 
novelly or his designees exercise their registration rights  such exercise may have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares of common stock 
those shareholders holding shares of our common stock prior to our july offering our founding shareholders  see item security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management and related stockholder matters founding shares owned by the founding shareholders below and mr 
paul a 
novelly  our executive chairman of the board  or his designees  are entitled to demand that we register under the securities act of  as amended or the securities act  the resale of their shares of our common stock issued prior to our july offering the founding shares and their shares included in the units purchased in our initial public offering 
the demand may be made at any time after the date on which we became a reporting company under the exchange act  and their founding shares have been released from escrow 
this occurred on july  if our founding shareholders exercise their registration rights with respect to all of their shares of our common stock  there will be an additional  shares which includes the  shares issued on exercise of their warrants eligible for trading in the public market 
the presence of this additional number of shares eligible for trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares 
we may be suspended or delisted from the new york stock exchange if we do not satisfy their continued listing requirements 
our common stock commenced trading on the nyse on march  under the symbol ff 
securities admitted to the nyse may be suspended from dealing or delisted at any time the listed company fails to satisfy certain continued listing criteria 
these criteria could be triggered if  among other things  the number of our publicly held shares falls below  the average closing price of our common stock is less than per share over a consecutive trading day period  or we fail to file certain reports with the sec 
as a matter of practice  the nyse generally gives a listed company notice if any of these criteria are triggered  and generally provides the listed company with certain cure periods 
if we suffer such an event but do not cure it  or if such event cannot be cured  trading of our common stock on the nyse may be suspended from dealing or our stock may be delisted 
any such suspension or delisting may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
we may issue substantial amounts of additional shares without stockholder approval 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of  shares of common stock and  shares of preferred stock 
as of the date of this report   shares of our common stock currently are outstanding 
the issuance of any additional shares of our common stock or preferred stock would dilute the percentage ownership of our company held by existing stockholders 
the market price of our common stock is highly volatile and may increase or decrease dramatically at any time 
the market price of our common stock is highly volatile and our shares are thinly traded 
our stock price may change dramatically as the result of i announcements of new products or innovations by us or our competitors  ii uncertainty regarding the viability of any of our product initiatives  iii significant customer contracts  iv significant litigation  v the loss of the rfs mandate  or vi other factors or events that would be expected to affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and future prospects 
the market price for our common stock may also be affected by various factors not directly related to our business or future prospects  including the following intentional manipulation of our stock price by existing or future shareholders  a reaction by investors to trends in our stock rather than the fundamentals of our business  a single acquisition or disposition  or several related acquisitions or dispositions  of a large number of our shares  including by short sellers covering their position  the interest of the market in our business sector  without regard to our financial condition  results of operations  or business prospects  positive or negative statements or projections about us or our industry by analysts and other persons  the adoption of governmental regulations or government grant programs and similar developments in the united states or abroad that may enhance or detract from our ability to offer our products and services or affect our cost structure  and economic and other external market factors  such as a general decline in market price due to poor economic conditions  investor distrust  or a financial crisis 
if securities or industry analysts issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock or do not publish research or reports about our business  our stock price and trading volume could decline 
the trading market for shares of our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business 
it may be difficult for companies such as ours to attract independent equity research analysts to cover our common stock 
we do not control these analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports 
the price of our common stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our common stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business 
if one or more equity research analysts cease coverage of us  we could lose visibility in the market  which in turn could cause our stock price to decline

item properties 
our principal asset is a manufacturing plant situated on approximately  acres of land six miles southeast of batesville in north central arkansas fronting the white river 
approximately acres of the site are occupied with batch and continuous manufacturing facilities  laboratories  and infrastructure  including on site liquid waste treatment 
our subsidiary futurefuel chemical company is the fee owner of this plant and the land upon which it is situated which plant and land are not subject to any major encumbrances  and manufactures both biofuels and chemicals at the plant 
utilization of these facilities may vary with product mix and economic  seasonal  and other business conditions  but the plant is substantially utilized with the exception of facilities designated for capacity expansion of biodiesel 
the plant  including approved expansions  has sufficient capacity for existing needs and expected near term growth 
we believe that the plant is generally well maintained  in good operating condition  and suitable and adequate for its uses 
in february  we formed ffc grain  llc to acquire a granary in marianna  arkansas for use in our biofuels business 
ffc grain  llc acquired the granary in march and owns it in fee simple  and the land and improvements thereon are not subject to any material encumbrances 
on december   we acquired a  square foot warehouse in batesville  arkansas 
we intend to store inventories both raw goods and finished products from our chemicals business in this facility 
the warehouse is owned in fee simple by our subsidiary futurefuel warehouse company  llc  and the land and improvements thereon are not subject to any material encumbrances 
item legal proceedings 
we are not a party to  nor is any of our property subject to  any material pending legal proceedings  other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business 
however  from time to time  we may be parties to  or targets of  lawsuits  claims  investigations  and proceedings  including product liability  personal injury  asbestos  patent and intellectual property  commercial  contract  environmental  antitrust  health and safety  and employment matters  which we expect to be handled and defended in the ordinary course of business 
while we are unable to predict the outcome of any matters currently pending  we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of any such pending matters will have a material adverse effect on our overall financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
however  adverse developments could negatively impact earnings or cash flows in future periods

dollars in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities operating activities cash provided by operating activities increased from  in to  in  a net increase of  this increase was primarily attributable to i the timing of collections of accounts receivable  including those due from related parties  and ii changes in our inventory levels 
in  accounts receivable  including accounts receivable due from related parties  decreased cash provided by operating activities by  in  accounts receivable  including accounts receivable due from related parties  increased cash provided by operating activity by  this increase was primarily due to the timing and amount of receipts of customer payments 
additionally  a decrease in our inventory balance increased cash provided by operating activities by  in in  changes in our inventory balance reduced cash provided by operating activities by  partially offsetting these increases in cash provided by operating activities were decreases attributable to i accounts payable  including accounts payable to related parties  ii income taxes payable  and iii deferred revenue 
in  accounts payable  including accounts payable to related parties  increased cash provided by operating activities by  in  accounts payable  including accounts payable to related parties  decreased cash provided by operating activities by  this change was primarily attributable to differences in the timing and amount of payments to suppliers 
in  income taxes payable  combined with income taxes receivable  increased cash provided by operating activities by  in  income taxes payable decreased cash provided by operating activities by  this change is a result of the timing and amount of our income tax payments 
in  deferred revenue increased cash provided by operating activities by  in  deferred revenue increased cash provided by operating activities by  this change occurred as the construction related to capital projects we undertook on behalf of certain of our customers was largely completed and payments for those capital expenditures were received 
cash provided by operating activities increased from  in to  in  a net  increase 
this increase was primarily attributable to i an increase in net income  ii the timing of collections of accounts receivable  including those receivables from related parties  iii the timing of payments of accounts payable  including those payables to related parties  and iv cash receipts related to deferred revenue 
as will be discussed in more detail in the discussion of our results of operations  our net income increased from  in the to  in  an increase of  in  accounts receivable accounted for a  reduction in cash provided by operating activities 
in  accounts receivable accounted for a  reduction in cash provided by operating activities despite increased consolidated revenues 
the primary reason for this result was the retroactive reinstatement of the per gallon biodiesel blenders tax credit in december at december   we had an outstanding receivable from the federal government related to this credit of  this receivable was collected in february  increasing the cash provided by operating activities 
in  the change in accounts payable increased cash provided by operating activities by  in  the change in accounts payable increased cash provided by operating activities by  this increase in cash provided by operating activities is largely due to timing differences related to the receipt and payment of inventory and the timing of payment for capital expenditures 
in  deferred revenue contributed  to cash provided by operating activities 
in it contributed  this change is a result of progress made on capital projects we undertook on behalf of certain of our customers 
partially offsetting these increases in cash provided by operating activities was an increase in inventory 
in  inventory reduced cash provided by operating activities by  in  inventory reduced cash provided by operating activities by  the increase in inventory at the end of relative to year end primarily related to increased biodiesel feedstock 
investing activities cash used in investing activities decreased from  in to  in this decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in the net purchases of marketable securities in compared to such purchases totaled a net  in and decreased to total net purchases of  in additionally  capital expenditures decreased from  in to  in this decrease was attributable to the completion of certain capital projects undertaken on behalf of certain of our customers 
our capital expenditures and customer reimbursements are summarized in the table below 
partially offsetting these decreases in cash used in investing activities was a  change in restricted cash incurred in that was not experienced in we did not have restricted cash at december  or in dollars in thousands cash paid for capital expenditures cash received as reimbursement of capital expenditures cash paid  net of reimbursement  for capital expenditures cash used in investing activities increased from  in to  in  a net increase of  this increase was primarily attributable to a net increase in the purchases of marketable securities and an increase in capital expenditures 
in  we purchased a net  of marketable securities 
such purchases totaled  in such purchases were made to increase the expected returns on our cash holdings 
the increase in capital expenditures is largely the result of us undertaking certain capital projects on behalf of certain customers  a large portion of which was reimbursed by such customers and through federal and local government grants 
these reimbursements are summarized in the table above 
these increases in cash used in investing activities were partially offset by a reduction in our restricted cash balances of  in this reduction resulted from our short sale position in us treasuries being closed in when this happened  the cash which was previously held in a restricted margin account was returned to us 
financing activities cash used in financing activities increased from  in to  in this increase was primarily due to an increase in dividends paid in compared to and a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of stock in compared to in we paid  in dividends on our common stock 
dividend payments in included a special dividend payment of per common share and totaled  additionally  in we generated  in net proceeds from the issuance of common shares as part of our at the market offering 
in  such net proceeds totaled  cash provided by used in financing activities decreased from  in to  in this decrease was primarily attributable to reduced proceeds from the issuance of our common stock in compared to  which was partially offset by a reduction in dividend payments in in   in net proceeds were received from the issuance of our common stock 
such proceeds were primarily the result of the exercise of warrants to purchase our common shares 
all such warrants that were not exercised expired in as a result  no warrants were exercised in we did  however  generate  in in net proceeds from the issuance of common shares as part of our at the market offering under which we issued  shares of our common stock and as a result of the exercise of stock options 
cash dividends decreased from  in to  in  partially offsetting the reduction in proceeds from the issuance of shares of our common stock 
capital expenditure commitments we had no material capital projects as of december  historically  we finance capital requirements for our business with cash flows from operations and have not had the need to incur bank indebtedness to finance any of our operations during the periods discussed herein 
credit facility we entered into a million credit agreement with a commercial bank in march the loan is a revolving facility the proceeds of which may be used for our working capital  capital expenditures  and general corporate purposes 
the facility terminates on june  advances are made pursuant to a borrowing base 
advances are secured by a perfected first priority security interest in our accounts receivable and inventory 
the interest rate floats at certain margins over libor or base rate based upon the leverage ratio from time to time 
there is an unused commitment fee 
the ratio of total funded debt to ebitda may not be less than we had no borrowings under this credit facility at december    or we intend to fund future capital requirements for our businesses from cash flow generated by us as well as from existing cash  cash investments  and  if the need should arise  borrowings under our credit facility 
we do not believe there will be a need to issue any securities to fund such capital requirements 
department of energy grant we entered into a contract with a customer to design  construct  and operate a commercial scale plant to produce intermediate anode powder as a component of high performance graphite anode materials for lithium ion batteries 
in connection with this contract  we applied for a financial assistance award under the electric drive vehicle battery and component manufacturing initiative administered by the department of energy national energy technology laboratory on behalf of the office of energy efficiency and renewable energy 
an award was granted to us in the amount of  which we accepted on july  the funds were to be used to modify existing idle assets and to acquire and construct new assets to be used for the production of specialized materials for lithium ion batteries for electric cars and other applications 
we receive grant monies on a cost share basis as we incur construction related expenditures 
the amounts received under this arrangement are recorded as deferred revenue and are amortized into earnings over the anticipated life of the customer relationship 
such amortization began once construction was completed and the plant was placed into service 
this occurred in the third quarter of through december   we collected of this award 
the grant was closed in and no additional amounts were received in dividends in  we declared a special cash dividend aggregating per share on our common stock  with a record date and payment date previously discussed 
the special cash dividend amounted to  we also paid regular cash dividends aggregating per share on our common stock  with record dates and payment dates as set forth above 
the regular cash dividends amounted to  for total dividends paid by us in of  in  we declared a special cash dividend aggregating per share on our common stock  with a record date and payment date as previously discussed 
the special cash dividend amounted to  we also declared regular cash dividends aggregating per share on our common stock  with record dates and payment dates as set forth above 
the regular cash dividends amounted to  for total dividends paid by us in of  in  we declared special cash dividends aggregating per share on our common stock  with record dates and payment dates as previously discussed 
the special cash dividends amounted to  capital management as a result of our initial equity offering  our subsequent positive operating results  the exercise of warrants  and the issuance of shares in our at the market offering  we accumulated excess working capital 
some of this excess working capital was paid out in   and as a special cash dividend and in and as regular cash dividends 
regular cash dividends will also be paid in as previously discussed 
we intend to retain the remaining cash to fund infrastructure and capacity expansion at our batesville plant 
third parties have not placed significant restrictions on our working capital management decisions 
a significant portion of these funds were held in cash or cash equivalents at multiple financial institutions 
in and  we also had investments in certain preferred stock  trust preferred securities  and other equity instruments 
we classify these investments as current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and designate them as being available for sale 
accordingly  they are recorded at fair value  with the unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  reported as a component of stockholders equity 
the fair value of these preferred stock  trust preferred securities  and other equity instruments  including accrued dividends and interest  totaled  and  at december  and  respectively 
we also maintained a position in auction rate securities at december  we have selectively made investments in certain auction rate securities that we believed offered sufficient yield along with sufficient liquidity 
to date  all the auction rate securities in which we have invested have maintained a mechanism for liquidity  meaning that the respective auctions have not failed  the issuers have called the instruments  or a secondary market exists for liquidation of the securities 
we have classified these instruments as current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and carried them at their estimated fair market value 
the fair value of these instruments approximated their par value and  including accrued interest  totaled  at december  auction rate securities are typically long term bonds issued by an entity for which there is a series of auctions over the life of the bond that serve to reset the interest rate on the bonds to a market rate 
these auctions also serve as a mechanism to provide liquidity to the bond holders  as long as there are sufficient purchasers of the auction rate securities  the then owners of the auction rate securities are able to liquidate their investment through a sale to the new purchasers 
in the event of an auction failure  a situation when there are more sellers than buyers of a particular issue  the current owners of an auction rate security issue may not be able to liquidate their investment 
as a result of an auction failure  a holder may be forced to hold the particular security either until maturity or until a willing buyer is found 
even if a willing buyer is found  however  there is no guarantee that this willing buyer will purchase the security for its carrying value  which would result in a loss being realized on the sale 
lastly  we maintain depository accounts such as checking accounts  money market accounts  and other similar accounts at selected financial institutions 
results of operations in general we break our chemicals business into two main product groups custom manufacturing and performance chemicals 
custom manufacturing consists of products made for specific customers based upon specifications provided by such customers 
major products in the custom manufacturing group include i nonanoyloxybenzene sulfonate  a bleach activator manufactured exclusively for a customer for use in a household detergent  ii a proprietary herbicide and intermediates manufactured exclusively for a customer  iii chlorinated polyolefin adhesion promoters or cpos and antioxidant precursors or dipb for a customer  and iv a biocide intermediate for another customer 
the custom manufacturing group also includes agrochemicals as well as industrial and consumer products cosmetics and personal care products  specialty polymers  photographic and imaging chemicals  and an intermediate anode powder to be used as a component of high performance graphite anode materials for lithium ion batteries 
revenues generated from the bleach activator are based on a supply agreement with the customer 
the supply agreement stipulates selling price per kilogram based on volume sold  with price moving up as volumes move down  and vice versa 
on august   we signed an amendment to our existing agreement with the bleach activator customer 
among other things  the amendment i extended the term of the agreement to december  unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions of the agreement  and ii allows us to sell certain formulations of the bleach activator to third parties as a performance chemical 
we pay for raw materials required to produce the bleach activator 
the contract with the customer provides that the price received by us for the bleach activator is indexed to changes in certain items  enabling us to pass along most inflationary increases in production costs to the customer 
we continue to work collaboratively with our customer to assess their future demand  which may continue to decline 
the financial impact of any such decline is not known at this time 
we and our predecessor at our batesville plant have been the primary manufacturer of a proprietary herbicide and certain intermediates for a customer and its predecessors since approximately however  in recent years  these products have faced generic competition  from other suppliers to our customer  from others who compete with our customer for the sale of herbicides  and from other agricultural chemicals present in the market place 
in response to its perceptions of this competition  in the customer initiated discussions with us to reduce volume and alter other terms of the contracts 
sales of these products  as will be discussed below  declined 
being of the opinion that the current contracts do not adequately provide a framework to support our mutual efforts  we exercised our rights to terminate these contracts  effective september  for the proprietary herbicide and october  for the intermediates 
we anticipate that we will continue to do business with our customer after those dates provided we can reach mutually acceptable terms 
in  we entered into a contract with a new customer for the toll manufacture of an industrial intermediate utilized in the antimicrobial industry 
we invested approximately million in capital expenditures to modify and expand our plant to produce this industrial intermediate 
the customer reimbursed these expenditures  which reimbursements have been classified as deferred revenue on our balance sheet and will be earned into income over the expected life of the product 
the contract stipulates a price curve based on volumes sold and has an inflationary pricing provision whereby we pass along most inflationary changes in production costs to the customer 
pricing for the other custom manufacturing products is negotiated directly with the customer 
some  but not all  of these products have pricing mechanisms and or protections against raw material or conversion cost changes 
performance chemicals consist of specialty chemicals that are manufactured to general market determined specifications and are sold to a broad customer base 
the major product line in the performance chemicals group is ssipa lisipa  a polymer modifier that aids the properties of nylon 
this group of products also includes sulfonated monomers and hydrotropes  specialty solvents  polymer additives  and chemical intermediates 
ssipa lisipa revenues are generated from a diverse customer base of nylon fiber manufacturers and other customers that produce condensation polymers 
contract sales are  in certain instances  indexed to key raw materials for inflation  otherwise  there is no pricing mechanism or specific protection against raw material or conversion cost changes 
pricing for the other performance chemical products is established based upon competitive market conditions 
some  but not all  of these products have pricing mechanisms and or specific protections against raw material or conversion cost changes 
for our biofuels segment  we procure all of our own feedstock and only sell biodiesel for our own account 
in rare instances  we purchase biodiesel from other producers for resale 
we have the capability to process multiple types of feedstock including vegetable oils and animal fats 
we can receive feedstock by rail or truck  and we have substantial storage capacity to acquire feedstock at advantaged prices when market conditions permit 
in  we redesigned our continuous line to produce biodiesel from feedstock with high free fatty acids 
by the end of  daily production volumes from the redesigned line demonstrated a production capacity in excess of million gallons of biodiesel per year 
debottlenecking has increased the annual capacity to in excess of million gallons per year 
projects are currently in progress to further debottleneck and optimize the plant to run at higher rates 
there currently is uncertainty as to whether we will produce biodiesel in the future 
this uncertainty results from i changes in feedstock prices relative to biodiesel prices  and ii the permanency of government mandates and tax credits 
see risk factors above 
while biodiesel is the principal component of the biofuels segment  we also generate revenue from the sale of petrodiesel both in blends with our biodiesel and  from time to time  with no biodiesel added 
petrodiesel and biodiesel blends are available to customers at our leased storage facility in north little rock  arkansas and at our batesville plant 
in addition  we deliver blended product to a small group of customers within our region 
we also sell refined petroleum products from time to time on common carrier pipelines in part to maintain our status as a shipper on the pipeline 
the majority of our expenses are cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold includes raw material costs as well as both fixed and variable conversion costs  conversion costs being those expenses that are directly or indirectly related to the operation of our plant 
significant conversion costs include labor  benefits  energy  supplies  depreciation  and maintenance and repair 
in addition to raw material and conversion costs  cost of goods sold includes environmental reserves and costs related to idle capacity 
finally  cost of goods sold includes hedging gains and losses recognized by us related to our biofuels segment 
cost of goods sold is allocated to the chemicals and biofuels business segments based on equipment and resource usage for most conversion costs and based on revenues for most other costs 
operating costs include selling  general and administrative  and research and development expenses 
the discussion of results of operations that follows is based on revenues and expenses in total and for individual product lines and do not differentiate related party transactions 
fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  set forth below is a summary of certain financial information for the periods indicated 
dollars in thousands other than per share amounts twelve months ended december  twelve months ended december  dollar change change revenues income from operations net income earnings per common share basic earnings per common share diluted capital expenditures net of customer reimbursements and regulatory grants adjusted ebitda we use adjusted ebitda as a key operating metric to measure both performance and liquidity 
adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure 
adjusted ebitda is not a substitute for operating income  net income  or cash flow from operating activities each as determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of performance or liquidity 
adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results as reported under gaap 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income before interest  income taxes  depreciation  and amortization expenses  excluding  when applicable  non cash stock based compensation expenses  public offering expenses  acquisition related transaction costs  purchase accounting adjustments  losses on disposal of property and equipment  gains or losses on derivative instruments  and other non operating income or expenses 
information relating to adjusted ebitda is provided so that investors have the same data that we employ in assessing the overall operation and liquidity of our business 
our calculation of adjusted ebitda may be different from similarly titled measures used by other companies  therefore  the results of our calculation are not necessarily comparable to the results of other companies 
adjusted ebitda allows our chief operating decision makers to assess the performance and liquidity of our business on a consolidated basis to assess the ability of our operating segments to produce operating cash flow to fund working capital needs  to fund capital expenditures  and to pay dividends 
in particular  our management believes that adjusted ebitda permits a comparative assessment of our operating performance and liquidity  relative to a performance and liquidity based on gaap results  while isolating the effects of depreciation and amortization  which may vary among our operating segments without any correlation to their underlying operating performance  and of non cash stock based compensation expense  which is a non cash expense that varies widely among similar companies  and gains and losses on derivative instruments  whose immediate recognition can cause net income to be volatile from period to period due to the timing of the valuation change in the derivative instruments relative to the sale of biofuel

revenues from biofuels increased and accounted for of total revenues in as compared to in revenues from chemicals decreased and accounted for of total revenues in as compared to in within the chemicals segment  revenues for changed as follows as compared to i revenues from the bleach activator decreased  ii revenues from the proprietary herbicide and intermediates decreased  iii revenues from cpos increased  iv revenues from dipb increased  and v revenues from other custom products increased 
revenues from the bleach activator and the proprietary herbicide and intermediates are together the most significant components of our chemicals segment revenue base  accounting for of total revenues for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  these products comprised a smaller percentage of our total revenues in as revenues from our biofuels segment assumed a larger percentage 
additionally  revenues from the bleach activator and the proprietary herbicide decreased in this decrease was attributable to reduced volumes for both products in  and was partially offset by increased per unit sales prices 
we are unable to predict with any certainty the revenues we will receive from these products in the future 
revenues from cpos and dipb together increased during the end market for cpos is the automotive industry  an industry whose economic activity can vary significantly from year to year 
as a result  demand for cpos can  and has  varied over the last couple of years 
this product suffered from a reduction in demand in  but experienced an increase in revenues from these products also benefited from inflationary price increases in revenues from other custom chemical products increased in as compared to this increase was primarily due to continued sales of a product we periodically produce for a customer and  to a lesser extent  commercial sales of lithium ion battery material 
in  we had modest sales of the lithium ion battery material and sales of the periodically produced product were limited 
in  quantities of the periodically produced product were sold consistently throughout the year 
since its introduction  demand for the lithium ion battery material has been low 
sales of this material are not expected to be material in our contract with our customer for this material provides for compensation to us if certain quantities of material are not purchased over certain periods of time 
revenues from proprietary chemicals increased in as compared to and account for approximately of total revenues in this increase was due to sales of new performance chemicals  including crude glycerin  and increased sales of ssipa 
revenues from biofuels increased from  in to  in sales of biodiesel in the first quarter of were limited due to the initial conversion to lower grade biodiesel feedstocks and adaptation to the improvement in biodiesel economics  whereas in  despite a decline in fourth quarter sales quantities  biodiesel was produced and sold over a larger percentage of the fiscal year 
as a result  revenues from biofuels increased substantially in compared to revenues from our biofuels have also been benefited by our sales of refined petroleum products as a shipper on a common carrier pipeline 
such sales totaled  in compared to  in such sales have little impact on gross margin 
a substantial portion of our biodiesel sold in was to a major refiner in the united states and no assurances can be given that we will continue to sell to such major refiner  or  if we do sell  the volume we will sell or the profit margin we will realize 
we continue to expand our regional blended fuel distribution business 
cost of goods sold and distribution total cost of goods sold and distribution for were  as compared to total cost of goods sold and distribution of  in  an increase of  which compares to a increase in revenues for the period 
cost of goods sold and distribution for for our chemicals segment totaled  as compared to cost of goods sold and distribution for of  an reduction 
this reduction in cost of goods sold and distribution was primarily due to reduced sales volumes of certain chemical products including the bleach activator and the proprietary herbicide 
further reductions in cost of good sold and distribution resulted from adjustments in our inventory carrying value as determined utilizing the lifo method of inventory accounting 
on a percentage basis  the reduction in costs of goods sold and distribution in as compared to was greater than the reduction in chemical segment revenues due to increased per unit sales prices of certain chemical products as compensation for lower quantities of material purchased and inflationary price adjustments 
cost of goods sold and distribution for for our biofuel segment were  as compared to cost of good sold and distribution for of  on a percentage basis  cost of goods sold and distribution increased versus an increase in revenues of 
market conditions were less favorable for biodiesel in as compared to partly as a result of the expiration of the blenders credit at december  when in effect  this credit was recorded as a reduction in cost of goods sold and distribution expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
after its expiration  no related reduction to cost of goods sold and distribution expense was recorded 
the existence of this credit was a significant factor in the profitability of biodiesel production 
further reducing biofuel gross margin relative to its gross margin in was a reduction in of the amount we were awarded under the usda section advanced biofuel producers program 
in we were awarded approximately  and in we were awarded  under this program 
this award is recorded as a reduction in our cost of goods sold and distribution expense in the period funding is received 
biodiesel profitability was particularly low in the fourth quarter of  as the biodiesel consumption mandate established by the government was largely met early in the quarter 
on january   the blenders credit was retroactively reinstated for and extended through december  this action resulted in our biodiesel blending activities from january  to december  qualifying for this credit 
the retroactive credit for totals  and will be recognized as a reduction in cost of goods sold in the first quarter of operating expenses operating expenses increased from  in to  in this increase was primarily the result of increased legal expenditures associated with ongoing and completed litigation and expenditures incurred for the registration of product for sale in the european union 
additionally  in we realized a reduction in certain operating expenditures and such reduction did not repeat in provision for income taxes the effective tax rates for the years ended december  and reflect our expected tax rate on reported operating earnings before income taxes 
at december  we did not believe that we had a more likely than not probability of realizing a portion of our deferred tax assets 
as such  we recorded a valuation allowance of  at december  no such valuation allowance was recorded at december  on december   a tax credit for small agri biodiesel producers with production capacity not in excess of million gallons expired 
this credit had totaled per gallon for the first million gallons of agri biodiesel sold 
on january   the small agri biodiesel producers credit was retroactively reinstated for and extended through december  this action resulted in futurefuel s biodiesel production activities from january  to december  qualifying for this credit 
the retroactive income tax credit for totaled  and will be recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes in the first quarter of income taxes we had no liability for uncertain tax positions at december  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  revenues revenues for the year ended december  were  as compared to revenues for the year ended december  of  an increase of 
revenues from biofuels increased and accounted for of total revenues in as compared to in revenues from chemicals decreased and accounted for of total revenues in as compared to in within the chemicals segment  revenues for changed as follows as compared to i revenues from the bleach activator decreased  ii revenues from the proprietary herbicide and intermediates increased  iii revenues from cpos decreased  iv revenues from dipb increased  and v revenues from other products decreased revenues from the bleach activator and the proprietary herbicide and intermediates were the most significant components of our chemicals segment revenue base in and  accounting for of total revenues for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  these products comprised a smaller percentage of our total revenues in as revenues from our biofuels segment assumed a larger percentage 
additionally  revenues from the bleach activator decreased in from levels 
this decrease was attributable to reduced volumes sold in with respect to the proprietary herbicide  the increase in revenues in as compared to was primarily the result of pricing increases caused by increased raw material costs 
revenues from cpos and dipb together decreased during in  this product benefited from the improved economic conditions of the automotive industry 
in  this product suffered from a reduction in demand 
some of the decrease in cpo revenues was offset by an increase in revenues from dipb in as compared to revenues from other custom chemical products decreased in as compared to this decrease was almost entirely due to production ceasing in early on one product which we campaigned for a customer in a second campaign for this same customer was started in the fourth quarter of revenues from proprietary chemicals increased in as compared to and account for approximately of total revenues in this increase was due to sales of new performance chemicals  including crude glycerin  and increased sales of ssipa 
revenues from biofuels increased from  in to  in the reinstatement of the per gallon federal blenders credit in december along with the government mandated renewable fuel standard for biodiesel combined to improve the economics of biodiesel  and demand and production increased in relative to the blenders credit expired on december   but has subsequently been reinstated  see above 
cost of goods sold and distribution total cost of goods sold and distribution for were  as compared to total cost of goods sold and distribution of  in  an increase of  which is comparable to the increase in revenue for that period 
cost of good sold and distribution for for our chemicals segment totaled  as compared to cost of goods sold and distribution for of  on a percentage basis  the reduction in costs of good sold and distribution in as compared to was comparable to the reduction in chemical revenues  with the differences largely being attributable to differences in product mix from to and from the increase in biofuel related sales  which causes a higher percentage of our fixed costs to be allocated to our biofuels segment 
these items were partially offset by expenses we were unable to pass along to customers 
cost of good sold and distribution for for our biofuel segment were  as compared to cost of good sold and distribution for of  on a percentage basis  cost of goods sold and distribution increased versus an increase in revenues of 
this difference is due in part to our receipt of approximately  awarded to us under the usda section advanced biofuel producers program in the third quarter of this award totaled  in based on the characteristics of the award  we recognize the income from it in the period funding is received 
additionally  the per gallon federal blenders credit existed throughout and it did not exist for the majority of the existence of this credit was a significant factor in the profitability of biodiesel production 
both the usda section advanced biofuel producer grant and the per gallon federal blenders credit are recorded as a reduction to our cost of goods sold and distribution expenses in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income 
since december   we have continued to acquire biodiesel feedstock and produce biodiesel 
the per gallon federal blenders credit expired effective december   but has subsequently been reinstated  see above 
operating expenses operating expenses increased from  in to  in the primary cause of this increase was an increase in compensation expense from  in to  in this increase was primarily attributable to  being recognized in non cash stock based compensation expense in connection with the issuance of stock options to our board of directors and certain members of our management 
no such expense was recorded in as no stock based compensation was granted 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rates for the years ended december  and reflect our expected tax rate on reported operating earnings before income taxes 
we have determined that we do not believe that we have a more likely than not probability of realizing a portion of our deferred tax assets 
as such  we have recorded a valuation allowance of  at december  income taxes we had no liability for uncertain tax positions at december  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
critical accounting estimates allowance for doubtful accounts we reduce our accounts receivable by amounts that may be uncollectible in the future 
this estimated allowance is based upon management s evaluation of the collectability of individual invoices and is based upon management s evaluation of the financial condition of our customers and historical bad debt experience 
this estimate is subject to change based upon the changing financial condition of our customers 
at december  and  we recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of and  respectively 
the allowance in pertained to one customer 
we historically have not experienced significant problems in collecting our receivables and we do not expect this to change going forward 
depreciation depreciation is provided for using the straight line method over the associated assets estimated useful lives 
we primarily base our estimate of an asset s useful life on our experience with other similar assets 
the actual useful life of an asset may differ significantly from our estimate for such reasons as the asset s build quality  the manner in which the asset is used  or changes in the business climate 
when the actual useful life differs from the estimated useful life  impairment charges may result 
we monitor the estimated useful lives of our assets and do not currently anticipate impairment charges 
asset retirement obligations we establish reserves for closure post closure costs associated with the environmental and other assets we maintain 
environmental assets include waste management units such as incinerators  landfills  storage tanks  and boilers 
when these types of assets are constructed or installed  a reserve is established for the future costs anticipated to be associated with the closure of the site based on an expected life of the environmental assets  the applicable regulatory closure requirements  and our environmental policies and practices 
these expenses are charged into earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets 
the future costs anticipated to be associated with the closure of the site are based upon estimated current costs for such activities adjusted for anticipated future inflation rates 
unanticipated changes in either of these two variables or changes in the anticipated timing of closure post closure activities may significantly affect the established reserves 
as of december  and december   we recorded a reserve for closure post closure liabilities of  and  respectively 
we monitor this reserve and the assumptions used in its calculation 
as deemed necessary  we have made changes to this reserve balance and anticipate that future changes will occur 
revenue recognition for most product sales  revenue is recognized when product is shipped from our facilities and risk of loss and title have passed to the customer  which is in accordance with our customer contracts and the stated shipping terms 
nearly all custom manufactured products are manufactured under written contracts 
performance chemicals and biodiesel are generally sold pursuant to the terms of written purchase orders 
in general  customers do not have any rights of return  except for quality disputes 
however  all of our products are tested for quality before shipment  and historically returns have been inconsequential 
we do not offer rebates or warranties 
bill and hold transactions for related to six specialty chemical customers whereby revenue was recognized in accordance with contractual agreements based upon product being produced and ready for use 
theses sales were subject to written monthly purchase orders with agreement that production was reasonable 
the inventory was custom manufactured and stored at the customer s request and could not be sold to another buyer 
credit and payment terms for bill and hold transactions are similar to other specialty chemical customers 
sales revenues under bill and hold arrangements totaled   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we sell petroleum products from time to time on common carrier pipelines in part to maintain our status as a shipper on the pipeline 
when such transactions result in us purchasing and selling product to the same counterparty  such transactions are recorded net as an element of revenue or cost of goods sold 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective income tax basis 
a future income tax asset or liability is estimated for each temporary difference using enacted and substantively enacted income tax rates and laws expected to be in effect when the asset is realized or the liability settled 
changes in the expected tax rates and laws to be in effect when the asset is realized or the liability settled could significantly affect the income tax assets and liabilities booked by us 
we monitor changes in applicable tax laws and adjust our income tax assets and liabilities as necessary 
off balance sheet arrangements we engage in two types of hedging transactions 
first  we hedge our biofuels sales through the purchase and sale of futures contracts and options on futures contracts of energy commodities 
this activity was captured on our balance sheet at december  and december  second  we hedge our biofuels feedstock through the execution of purchase contracts and supply agreements with certain vendors 
these hedging transactions are recognized in earnings and were not recorded on our balance sheet at december  or december  as they do not meet the definition of a derivative instrument as defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the us the purchase of biofuels feedstock generally involves two components basis and price 
basis covers any refining or processing required as well as transportation 
price covers the purchases of the actual agricultural commodity 
both basis and price fluctuate over time 
a supply agreement with a vendor constitutes a hedge when we have committed to a certain volume of feedstock in a future period and have fixed the basis for that volume 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth as of december  the payments due by period for the following contractual obligations 
dollars in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations a capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations b other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet under gaap c total a as of december   we had no borrowings under the million credit agreement described above 
b purchase obligations within less than one year include i the purchase of biodiesel feedstock to be taken during  and ii various other infrastructure and capital repairs 
c a component of other noncurrent liabilities is a reserve for asset retirement obligations and environmental contingencies of at december  we are liable for these asset retirement obligations and environmental contingencies only in certain events  primarily the closure of our batesville  arkansas facility 
as such  we do not expect a payment related to these liabilities in the foreseeable future and therefore we have excluded this amount from the table above 
other matters we entered into an agreement with a customer to construct  at a fixed price  a processing plant and to produce a certain chemical for the customer 
we engaged a third party to act as general contractor on the construction of this plant for a guaranteed price 
that general contractor defaulted on its obligations under its contract with us and abandoned the project 
the general contractor s default did not have a material adverse effect on us or our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
as a result of the contractor s default  we undertook the general contractor role ourselves 
we also filed suit against our former contractor to recoup any damages that we incurred as a result of his default 
the former contractor counterclaimed against us for amounts he asserted were due him under our contract with him 
the trial was conducted on this matter and the jury determined that we were not the breaching party under the contract but rather the general contractor was the breaching party and that the general contractor did not substantially complete his obligations under the contract 
the jury did however award the contractor certain amounts that the jury determined we owed him under the contract for services rendered through the date of breach 
upon our motion  the court reduced the amount awarded by the jury 
such amount does not have a material adverse effect on our overall financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
both we and the contractor appealed certain rulings made in the course of this case and those appeals are pending 
we do not believe that the effect of these appeals will have a material adverse effect our overall financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in recent years  general economic inflation has not had a material adverse impact on our costs and  as described elsewhere herein  we have passed some price increases along to our customers 
however  we are subject to certain market risks as described below 
market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
commodity price risk is inherent in the chemical and biofuels business both with respect to input electricity  coal  raw materials  biofuel feedstocks  etc 
and output manufactured chemicals and biofuels 
we seek to mitigate our market risks associated with the manufacturing and sale of chemicals by entering into term sale contracts that include contractual market price adjustment protections to allow changes in market prices of key raw materials to be passed on to the customer 
such price protections are not always obtained  however  so raw material price risk remains a significant risk 
in order to manage price risk caused by market fluctuations in biofuel prices  we may enter into exchange traded commodity futures and options contracts 
we account for these derivative instruments in accordance with asc  derivatives and hedging  hedging general  recognition 
under this standard  the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends upon whether it has been designated as an accounting hedging relationship and  further  on the type of hedging relationship 
to qualify for designation as an accounting hedging relationship  specific criteria must be met and appropriate documentation maintained 
we had no derivative instruments that qualified under these rules as designated accounting hedges in or changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments are recognized at the end of each accounting period and recorded in the statement of operations as a component of cost of goods sold 
our immediate recognition of derivative instrument gains and losses can cause net income to be volatile from period to period due to the timing of the change in value of the derivative instruments relative to the sale of biofuel being sold 
as of december  and  the fair values of our derivative instruments were a net liability in the amount of  and  respectively 
our gross profit will be impacted by the prices we pay for raw materials and conversion costs costs incurred in the production of chemicals and biofuels for which we do not possess contractual market price adjustment protection 
these items are principally comprised of crude corn oil and yellow grease and petrodiesel 
the availability and price of these items are subject to wide fluctuations due to unpredictable factors such as weather conditions  overall economic conditions  governmental policies  commodity markets  and global supply and demand 
we prepared a sensitivity analysis of our exposure to market risk with respect to key raw materials and conversion costs for which we do not possess contractual market price adjustment protections  based on average prices in we included only those raw materials and conversion costs for which a hypothetical adverse change in price would result in a or greater decrease in gross profit 
assuming that the prices of the associated finished goods could not be increased and assuming no change in quantities sold  a hypothetical change in the average price of the commodities listed below would result in the following change in annual gross profit 
volumes and dollars in thousands item volume a requirements units hypothetical adverse change in price decrease in gross profit percentage decrease in gross profit crude corn oil and yellow grease lb petrodiesel gal electricity mwh a volume requirements and average price information are based upon volumes used and prices obtained for the twelve months ended december  volume requirements may differ materially from these quantities in future years as our business evolves 
we had no borrowings as of december  or and  as such  we were not exposed to interest rate risk for those years 
due to the relative insignificance of transactions denominated in a foreign currency  we consider our foreign currency risk to be immaterial
