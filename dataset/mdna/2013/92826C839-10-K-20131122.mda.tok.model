overview visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers  businesses  financial institutions and governments around the world to fast  secure and reliable electronic payments 
we provide our financial institution clients with a global payments infrastructure and support services for the delivery of visa branded payment products  including credit  debit and prepaid 
we facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions  merchants  consumers  businesses and government entities 
each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paper based to electronic forms of payment  and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunities  particularly outside the united states 
we continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment solutions we provide 
overall economic conditions 
our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending 
our business performance during fiscal reflects the impacts of a slow moving global economic recovery 
interchange multidistrict litigation 
on october   visa  mastercard  various us financial institution defendants and the class plaintiffs signed a settlement agreement to resolve the class plaintiffs claims in the interchange multidistrict litigation 
the court entered the preliminary approval order of the settlement agreement on november  on december   visa paid approximately billion from the litigation escrow account into a settlement fund established pursuant to the definitive class settlement agreement 
certain merchants in the proposed settlement classes  however  have objected to the settlement and a number of merchants have filed opt out claims 
until the settlement agreement is finally approved by the court and any appeals are finally adjudicated  no assurance can be provided that visa will be able to resolve the class plaintiffs claims as contemplated by the settlement agreement 
we also signed a settlement agreement to resolve the claims brought by a group of individual merchants which were consolidated with the interchange multidistrict litigation for coordination of pre trial proceedings 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  we paid million from the litigation escrow account to the individual merchants on october   and on november   the court entered an order dismissing the individual merchants claims with prejudice

adjusted financial results 
our financial results for fiscal and reflect the impact of several significant items that we believe are not indicative of our financial performance in the prior or future years  as they either are non recurring  have no cash impact or are related to amounts covered by the retrospective responsibility plan 
as such  we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following amounts provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented 
reversal of tax reserves 
during fiscal  we reversed all previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense recorded in fiscal through fiscal this increased our net income for fiscal by million 
litigation provision 
during fiscal  we recorded a litigation provision of billion and related tax benefits associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation  which is covered by the retrospective responsibility plan

table of contents deferred tax adjustment 
during fiscal  our reported financial results benefited from a one time  non cash adjustment of million related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities attributable to changes in the california state apportionment rules 
revaluation of visa europe put option 
during fiscal  we recorded a decrease of million in the fair value of the visa europe put option  which resulted in the recognition of non cash  non operating income in our financial results 
this amount is not subject to income tax and therefore had no impact on our reported income tax provision

the litigation provision adjustment to net income attributable to visa inc is shown net of tax 
the tax impact is determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates to the litigation provision 
nominal payments volume and transaction counts 
payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues  and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues 
compared to the prior year  overall payments volume grew in all categories worldwide except us consumer debit  which has been negatively impacted by the dodd frank act beginning april  the number of processed transactions continues to increase at a healthy rate  reflecting the continuing worldwide shift to electronic currency

results of operations operating revenues our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on visa branded cards and payment products for purchased goods and services  as well as the number of transactions processed on our network 
we do not earn revenues from  or bear credit risk with respect to  interest or fees paid by account holders on visa branded cards or payment products 
our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and other payment products  and determining the interest rates and fees paid by account holders 
we generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for acceptance by the acquirers  including the merchant discount rate 
our acquiring clients are generally responsible for soliciting merchants  and establishing and earning these fees 
the following sets forth the components of our operating revenues service revenues consist mainly of revenues earned for providing financial institution clients with support services for the delivery of visa branded payment products and solutions

percentage changes are calculated based on whole numbers  not the rounded numbers presented 
the increase in operating revenues mainly reflects continued growth in our underlying business drivers nominal payments volume  processed transactions  and cross border volume 
operating revenue growth also benefited from pricing modifications made on various services 
these benefits were partially offset by volume loss and increases to client incentives implemented in the united states during the second half of fiscal as part of our strategy to mitigate the impacts of the dodd frank act 
our operating revenues  primarily service revenues and international transaction revenues  are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the us dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to us dollars 
the effect of exchange rate movements in fiscal  as partially mitigated by our hedging program  resulted in an overall decline of about one percentage point in total operating revenue growth compared to fiscal while we expect our hedging program to continue to mitigate this risk during fiscal  a general strengthening of the us dollar is expected to reduce total operating revenue growth by about two percentage points for fiscal  net of offsetting hedges

service revenues increased in fiscal and primarily due to and growth in nominal payments volume  respectively 
the growth in service revenues in fiscal was greater than the growth in nominal payments volume due to a shift in the mix of our payments volume  primarily in volume related to interlink  which is a debit product that does not generate any service revenues 
data processing revenues increased in fiscal and due to overall growth in processed transactions of and  respectively  combined with pricing modifications that became effective in the third quarter of fiscal as part of our strategy to mitigate the negative impacts from the dodd frank act 
international transaction revenues increased in fiscal and primarily reflecting and growth in nominal cross border volume  respectively 
other revenues increased in fiscal and due to an increase in license fees as a result of payments volume growth 
client incentives increased in fiscal and  reflecting incentives incurred on long term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal and  respectively 
these included a number of significant long term merchant and acquirer contracts executed as part of our strategy to mitigate the impacts from the dodd frank act  as well as issuer contracts executed in fiscal additionally  client incentives increased as a result of overall growth in global payments volume 
activity in fiscal also reflects certain one time incentives incurred outside the united states 
the amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations  actual client performance  amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts

excluding the litigation provision of billion recorded in fiscal  associated with litigation covered by the retrospective responsibility plan  operating expenses for fiscal were billion  an increase of over fiscal on an adjusted basis 
personnel increased in fiscal mainly due to increases in headcount reflecting our strategy to invest for future growth  particularly in key product and geography specific initiatives  combined with severance charges incurred as a result of organizational restructuring that better aligns our costs and strategic priorities 
the increase in fiscal is primarily due to increases in headcount  and reflects annualized costs from our acquisitions of playspan and fundamo in march and june  respectively 
marketing remained relatively flat in fiscal and fiscal when compared to the respective prior year 
fiscal activity mainly reflected strategies to promote our core products  combined with a number of various campaigns  including the fifa confederation cup and the sochi winter olympics 
marketing in fiscal mainly reflected sponsorship of the london summer olympics  as well as spend in support of our new product initiatives 
network and processing in fiscal and increased mainly due to costs incurred for the operation of our processing network attributable to increased transaction volumes 
professional fees increased in fiscal and  primarily reflecting greater investment in technology projects 
depreciation and amortization increased in fiscal and  primarily due to additional depreciation from our ongoing investments in technology assets and infrastructure to support our core business as well as our ecommerce and mobile initiatives 
general and administrative remained flat in fiscal after experiencing an increase in fiscal mainly due to travel activities in support of our international expansion  combined with the absence of unrealized foreign exchange gains recorded in fiscal upon the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities held by foreign subsidiaries into their functional currencies 
litigation provision in fiscal reflects a billion accrual related to the covered litigation 
see note retrospective responsibility plan and note legal matters to our consolidated financial statements 
non operating income non operating income in fiscal of million decreased from million in fiscal primarily due to the reversal in fiscal of previously accrued interest expense associated with tax reserves for uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense 
see note income taxes and note legal matters 
table of contents to our consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in fiscal from million in fiscal was primarily due to the absence of a million non cash adjustment to the fair market value of the visa europe put option recorded in fiscal  and the absence of a pre tax gain of million recognized in fiscal upon the sale of our investment in visa vale issuer companhia brasileira de solu es e servi os  or cbss  offset by the reversal of previously accrued interest expense discussed above 
effective income tax rate the effective income tax rate of in fiscal differs from the effective income tax rates of and in fiscal and  respectively  mainly due to the decrease in overall ongoing state tax rate beginning in fiscal as a result of changes in california apportionment rules adopted in that year  a tax benefit recognized in fiscal as a result of new guidance issued by the state of california regarding apportionment rules for years prior to fiscal  certain foreign tax credit benefits related to prior years recognized in fiscal  and the absence of the following in fiscal the fiscal reversal of previously recorded tax reserves associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense  a fiscal one time  non cash benefit from the remeasurement of existing net deferred tax liabilities due to the changes in california apportionment rules adopted in that year  the effect of applying the aforementioned fiscal tax benefits to a fiscal pre tax income that was reduced by the billion covered litigation provision  and the nontaxable revaluation of the visa europe put option recorded in fiscal adjusted effective income tax rate for fiscal our financial results for fiscal reflected the impact of several significant items that we believe are not indicative of our financial performance in that or future years  as they were either non recurring  had no cash impact or were related to amounts covered by the retrospective responsibility plan 
as such  we have presented our fiscal adjusted effective income tax rate in the table below  which we believe provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the fiscal year 
our adjusted effective income tax rate for fiscal excludes the reversal of previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense  additional covered litigation provision recorded  and a one time  non cash benefit from the remeasurement of existing net deferred tax liabilities attributable to changes in the california state apportionment rules

our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives 
the objectives of our treasury policies are to 
table of contents provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios  ensure payments on required litigation settlements  ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities  make planned capital investments in our business  pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors  and optimize income earned by investing excess cash in securities that enable us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs 
based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short term and long term liquidity needs  we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next months 
we will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance  current economic and capital market conditions  and other relevant circumstances 
cash flow data the following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented in millions total cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities was lower during fiscal compared to prior year  reflecting payments from the litigation escrow account totaling billion in connection with the covered litigation 
as these payments were made from our litigation escrow account  they were also reflected as cash inflows under financing activities 
see note retrospective responsibility plan and note legal matters to our consolidated financial statements 
the tax deduction related to these payments contributed to the billion decline in overall income taxes paid during fiscal compared to prior year 
absent the above impacts  cash provided by operating activities would have totaled billion  an increase over fiscal  reflecting continued growth in operating revenues 
we believe that cash flow generated from operating activities will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs 
total cash provided by operating activities was higher during fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily reflecting higher operating revenues in fiscal investing activities 
cash used in investing activities was lower during fiscal compared to prior year  reflecting a decrease in purchases of available for sale investment securities  combined with greater proceeds received from maturities and sales of available for sale investment securities 
see note fair value measurements and investments to our consolidated financial statements 
cash used in investing activities during fiscal and was relatively consistent  reflecting our continued investment in available for sale securities 
financing activities 
cash used in financing activities during fiscal  and reflects our continued commitment to return excess cash to shareholders through reduction in the as converted class a share count  either through purchases in the open market or deposits made into the litigation escrow  and increased dividends 
cash used in financing activities also reflects cash inflows relating to payments made in connection with the covered litigation from the litigation escrow account 
see note retrospective responsibility plan  note stockholders equity and note legal matters to our consolidated financial statements 
sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand  cash flow from our operations  our investment portfolio  and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements 
funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents  and short term or long term available for sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements  our access to liquidity from these holdings  and the return that these holdings provide 
cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term available for sale investment securities held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled billion at september  if it were necessary to repatriate these funds for use 
table of contents in the united states  we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes on the amount of undistributed earnings in those subsidiaries  which we estimate to be approximately billion 
it is our intent to indefinitely reinvest the majority of these funds outside of the united states  and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our operations in the united states 
available for sale investment securities 
our investment portfolio is designed to invest excess cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs 
our investment portfolio primarily consists of debt securities issued by the us treasury or us government sponsored agencies 
the majority of these investments  billion  are classified as non current as they have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date 
however  these investments are generally available to meet short term liquidity needs 
factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include  but are not limited to  changes to credit ratings of the securities  uncertainty related to regulatory developments  actions by central banks and other monetary authorities  and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets 
we will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions 
however  if current market conditions deteriorate  the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired  which could adversely impact our financial results 
we have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment 
see item a risk factors included elsewhere in this report 
commercial paper program 
we maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes 
on february   we replaced the existing million program with a new commercial paper program 
under the new program  we are authorized to issue up to billion in outstanding notes  with maturities up to days from the date of issuance 
we had no outstanding obligations under the new program at september  see note debt to our consolidated financial statements 
credit facility 
on january   we entered into an unsecured billion revolving credit facility 
this credit facility  which expires on january   replaced our existing billion credit facility  which would have expired on february  the new credit facility contains covenants and events of default customary for facilities of this type 
there were no borrowings under the new credit facility and we were in compliance with all related covenants at september  see note debt to our consolidated financial statements 
universal shelf registration statement 
in july  we filed a registration statement with the sec using a shelf registration process 
as permitted by the registration statement  we may  from time to time  sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions 
this registration statement expires in july litigation escrow account 
pursuant to the terms of the retrospective responsibility plan  we maintain a litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of  or judgments in  the covered litigation will be payable 
when we fund the litigation escrow account  the shares of class b common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class b common stock to shares of class a common stock 
see note retrospective responsibility plan and note legal matters to our consolidated financial statements 
the balance in this account at september   was million and is reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet 
as these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the covered litigation matters  as described below under uses of liquidity  we do not rely on them for other operational needs 
credit ratings at september   our credit ratings by standard and poor s and moody s were as follows standard and poor s moody s debt type rating outlook rating outlook short term unsecured debt a stable p stable long term unsecured debt a stable a stable various factors affect our credit ratings  including changes in our operating performance  the economic environment  conditions in the electronic payment industry  our financial position and changes in our business strategy 
we do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded 
if a downgrade were to occur  it could adversely impact  among other things  our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

table of contents uses of liquidity payments settlement 
payments settlement due from and to our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement 
us dollar settlements are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance  while settlement currencies other than the us dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days  which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions 
during fiscal  however  we were only required to fund settlement related working capital on a few days  including a peak net settlement receivable balance of million 
our average daily net settlement position was a payable of million 
covered litigation 
we are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters  including certain litigation that we refer to as the covered litigation 
as noted above  monetary liabilities from settlements of  or judgments in  the covered litigation are payable from the litigation escrow account 
during fiscal  we made billion in covered litigation payments that were funded from the litigation escrow account  of which  billion was paid into a settlement fund established pursuant to the definitive class settlement agreement in the interchange multidistrict litigation 
under the settlement agreement  if class members opt out of the damages portion of the class settlement  defendants are entitled to receive takedown payments of no more than of the original cash payments made into the settlement fund  based on the percentage of payment card sales volume for a defined period attributable to merchants who opted out 
see note legal matters to our consolidated financial statements 
upon final court approval of the settlement agreement  visa portion of the takedown payments  calculated to be billion  will increase our current taxable income 
the resulting increase in our current taxable income will increase our deferred tax asset and income tax payable by million  which will have a negative impact on our free cash flow in the year the final court approval is rendered 
see note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements 
at september   the litigation escrow account had an available balance of million 
see note retrospective responsibility plan to our consolidated financial statements 
other litigation 
judgments in and settlements of litigation  other than the covered litigation  could give rise to future liquidity needs 
reduction in as converted shares 
during fiscal  we repurchased million shares of our class a common stock using billion of operating cash on hand 
at september   we had million of remaining funds available for share repurchases under the current program authorized by the board of directors 
in october  our board of directors authorized an additional billion share repurchase program 
see note stockholders equity to our consolidated financial statements 
dividends 
during fiscal  we paid million in dividends 
in october  our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of per share of class a common stock determined in the case of class b and class c common stock on an as converted basis 
we expect to pay approximately million in connection with this dividend on december  see note stockholders equity to our consolidated financial statements 
we expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash  subject to approval by our board of directors 
classes of b and c common stock will share ratably on an as converted basis in such future dividends 
visa europe put option 
we have granted visa europe a perpetual put option which  if exercised  will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of visa europe from its members 
visa europe may exercise the put option at any time 
the put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the visa europe shares  which subject to certain adjustments  applies visa inc forward price to earnings multiple  or the p e ratio as defined in the option agreement at the time the option is exercised to visa europe adjusted sustainable income for the forward month period  or the adjusted sustainable income as defined in the option agreement 
the calculation of visa europe adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items 
upon exercise  the key inputs to this formula  including visa europe adjusted sustainable income  will be the result of negotiation between us and visa europe 
the put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price 
the fair value of the put option represents the value of visa europe option  which  under certain conditions  could obligate us to purchase its member equity interest for an amount above fair value 
at september   we determined the fair value of the put option liability to be approximately million 
while this amount represents the fair value of the put option at september   it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised 
the purchase price we could be obligated to pay days after exercise will represent a substantial financial obligation  which could be several billion dollars or more 
we may 
table of contents need to obtain third party financing  either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment 
the amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on  among other things  visa europe adjusted sustainable income and our p e ratio  in each case  as negotiated at the time the put option is exercised 
given the perpetual nature of the put option and the various economic conditions which could be present at the time of exercise  our ultimate obligation in the event of exercise cannot be reliably estimated 
the following table calculates our total obligation assuming  for illustrative purposes only  a range of p e ratios for visa inc and assuming that visa europe demonstrates million of adjusted sustainable income at the date of exercise 
the million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below is for illustrative purposes only 
this does not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income visa europe would have been able to demonstrate at september   or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future 
should visa europe elect to exercise its option  we believe it is likely that it will implement changes in its business operations to move to a for profit model in order to maximize its adjusted sustainable income and  as a result  to increase the purchase price 
the table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout  assuming the same range of estimated p e ratios  for each million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed million demonstrated at the time of exercise 
at september   our estimated long term p e ratio was x and the long term p e differential  the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to visa europe  was x 
at september   the spot p e ratio was x and the spot p e differential  the difference between this ratio and the estimated spot ratio applicable to visa europe  was x 
these ratios are for reference purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the ratio or differential that could be applicable if the put option were exercised at any point in the future 
visa inc s forward price to earnings ratio payout assuming adjusted sustainable income of million increase decrease in payout for each million of adjusted sustainable income above below million in millions in millions given the large range of different economic environments and circumstances under which visa europe could decide to exercise its option  the ultimate purchase price could be several billion dollars or more 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
we sponsor various qualified and non qualified defined benefit pension plans that generally provide benefits based on years of service  age and eligible compensation 
we also sponsor a postretirement benefit plan that provides postretirement medical benefits for retirees and dependents upon meeting minimum age and service requirements 
our policy with respect to our qualified pension plan is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required under the employee retirement income security act 
our non qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis 
we typically fund our qualified pension plan in september of each year 
in fiscal  and  we made contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of million  million  and million  respectively 
the lower contribution in fiscal was driven by a higher than expected rate of return on our plan assets during the year and an increase in the discount rate at september  compared to september  in fiscal  given current projections and assumptions  we anticipate funding our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plan by approximately million 
the actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan  movements in the discount rate  performance of the plan assets  and related tax consequences 
see note pension  postretirement and other benefits to our consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures increased during fiscal due to investments in technology  infrastructure and growth initiatives 
we expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our core business as well as our ecommerce and mobile initiatives 
acquisitions 
there were no material acquisitions during fiscal and  compared to fiscal  when we acquired playspan and fundamo for a total of million  net of million in cash received 
we will continue to pursue our growth initiatives and to expand our product offerings through acquisitions and strategic partnerships in the future 

table of contents fair value measurements financial instruments the assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party  whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability 
as of september   our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately billion of assets and million of liabilities 
of these instruments  million  or  had significant unobservable inputs  including the visa europe put option liability of million  and million of auction rate securities 
see note fair value measurements and investments to our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees and indemnifications 
visa has no off balance sheet debt  other than lease and purchase order commitments  as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table 
indemnifications we indemnify clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other clients to honor visa branded cards and payment products processed in accordance with our operating regulations 
the amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled visa payment transactions at any point in time 
we maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk  which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met 
see note summary of significant accounting policies and note settlement guarantee management to our consolidated financial statements 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement 
contractual obligations our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity 
the contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on and off balance sheet transactions that represent a material  expected or contractually committed future obligation as of september  we believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities 
payments due by period less than year years years more than years total in millions purchase orders leases client incentives marketing and sponsorship dividends total  represents agreements to purchase goods and services that specify significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
includes operating leases for premises  equipment and software licenses  which range in terms from one to eighteen years 
represents future cash payments for long term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume  increase visa branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network 
these agreements  which range in terms from one to thirteen years  can provide card issuance and or conversion support  volume growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements 
payments under these agreements will generally be offset by revenues earned from higher corresponding payments and transaction volumes 
these payment amounts are estimates and will change based on client performance  amendments to 
table of contents existing contracts or execution of new contracts 
related amounts disclosed in note commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements represent the associated expected reduction of revenue related to these agreements that we estimate we will record 
visa is a party to contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from approximately three to sixteen years 
these contracts are designed to help increase visa branded cards and volumes 
over the life of these contracts  visa is required to make payments in exchange for certain advertising and promotional rights 
in connection with these contractual commitments  visa has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the life of the contract 
for obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract  we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent 
includes expected dividend amount of million as dividends were declared in october and will be paid on december  to all holders of record of visa common stock as of november  we have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of million 
at september   we also accrued million of interest and million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions 
we cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements  if any  associated with our uncertain tax positions 
therefore  no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table 
visa granted a perpetual put option to visa europe  which if exercised  will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of visa europe from its members 
due to the perpetual nature of the instrument and the various economic conditions  which could exist when the put is exercised  the ultimate amount and timing of visa obligation  if any  cannot be reliably estimated 
therefore  no amounts related to this obligation have been included in the table 
however  given the range of different economic environments and circumstances under which visa europe could exercise its option  the ultimate purchase price could be several billion dollars or more 
the fair value of the visa europe put option itself totaling million at september  has also been excluded from this table as it does not represent the amount  or an estimate of the amount  of visa obligation in the event of exercise 
see the liquidity and capital resources and critical accounting estimates sections of this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note visa europe to our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan  movements in the discount rate  performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences 
expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above  and may result in a wide range of amounts 
see note pension  postretirement and other benefits to our consolidated financial statements and the liquidity and capital resources section of this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
see note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements 
we have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period 
however  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results  as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
revenue recognition client incentives critical estimates 
we enter into incentive agreements with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume  increase visa branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network 
these incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues  however  if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established  they are accounted for as operating expenses 
we generally capitalize advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met 
the capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to visa  the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language eg  early termination clauses  management ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred 
capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit 
incentives not yet paid are accrued 
table of contents systematically and rationally based on management estimate of each client performance 
these accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate  based on changes in performance expectations  actual client performance  amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts 
assumptions and judgment 
estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume  card issuance and card conversion 
performance is estimated using customer reported information  transactional information accumulated from our systems  historical information and discussions with our clients 
impact if actual results differ from assumptions 
if our clients actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates  client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded 
increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume  which drive our net revenues 
as a result  in the event incentive payments exceed estimates  such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable 
for the year ended september   client incentives represented of gross operating revenues 
fair value visa europe put option critical estimates 
we have granted visa europe a perpetual put option which  if exercised  will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of visa europe from its members 
the put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the visa europe shares  which  subject to certain adjustments  applies our forward price to earnings multiple  or the p e ratio as defined in the option agreement  at the time the option is exercised to visa europe projected adjusted sustainable income for the forward month period  or the adjusted sustainable income as defined in the option agreement 
the calculation of visa europe adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items 
upon exercise  the key inputs to this formula  including visa europe adjusted sustainable income  will be the result of negotiation between us and visa europe 
the put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price 
see note visa europe to our consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the agreement 
the fair value of visa europe option was estimated to be approximately million at september  while the put option is in fact non transferable  this amount  recorded in our financial statements  represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay a third party market participant to transfer the potential obligation in an orderly transaction 
the fair value of the put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price  under the terms of the put agreement  to the estimated fair value of visa europe 
the fair value of visa europe is defined as the estimated amount a third party market participant might pay in an arm length transaction under normal business conditions 
a probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that visa europe will never exercise its option 
while this amount represents the fair value of the put option at september   it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised  which could be several billion dollars or more 
see the liquidity and capital resources section of management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion 
assumptions and judgment 
the most significant estimates used in the valuation of the put option are the assumed probability that visa europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated differential between the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock  as defined in the put option agreement  and that applicable to visa europe on a stand alone basis at the time of exercise  which we refer to as the p e differential 
probability of exercise exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of visa europe on behalf of the visa europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to visa europe  under its articles of association 
we estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including  but not limited to i visa europe stated intentions  ii indications that visa europe is preparing to exercise as reflected in its reported financial results  iii evaluation of market conditions  including the regulatory environment  that could impact the potential future profitability of visa europe  and iv qualitative factors applicable to visa europe largest members  which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings 

table of contents p e differential the p e differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward price to earnings multiples applicable to our common stock  as defined in the put option agreement  and that applicable to visa europe at the time of exercise 
for valuation purposes  the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measures and qualitative factors 
quantitatively  we estimate our p e ratio by dividing the average stock price over the preceding months the long term p e calculation and the last trading dates the day p e calculation prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the months starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date 
this median earnings estimate is obtained from the institutional brokers estimate system 
we then determine the best estimate of our long term price to earnings multiple for valuation purposes by qualitatively evaluating the day p e calculation as compared to the long term p e calculation 
in this evaluation we examine both measures to determine whether differences  if any  are the result of a fundamental change in our long term value or the result of short term market volatility or other non company specific market factors that may not be indicative of our long term forward p e 
we believe  given the perpetual nature of the put option  that a market participant would more heavily weigh long term value indicators  as opposed to short term indicators 
factors that might indicate a fundamental change in long term value include  but are not limited to  changes in the regulatory environment  client portfolios  long term growth rates or new product innovations 
a consistent methodology is applied to a group of comparable public companies used to estimate the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to visa europe 
these estimates  therefore  are impacted by changes in stock prices and the financial market expectations of our future earnings and those of comparable companies 
other estimates of lesser significance include growth rates and foreign currency exchange rates applied in the calculation of visa europe adjusted sustainable income 
the valuation model assumes a large range of annual growth rates  reflecting the different economic environments and circumstances under which visa europe could decide to exercise its option 
the lowest growth rates assumed reflect visa europe current business model as an association  owned by its member banks  while the highest reflect a successful shift to a for profit model in anticipation of its exercise 
the scenarios with higher growth rates are assigned a significantly higher probability in the valuation model  as we believe a market participant would more heavily weigh these scenarios as it is likely that  should it choose to exercise its option  visa europe will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting a for profit business model in advance of exercising the put option 
the foreign exchange rate used to translate visa europe results from euros to us dollars reflects a blend of forward exchange rates observed in the marketplace 
the assumed timing of exercise of the put option used in the various modeled scenarios is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation  as obligations calculated in later years are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value 
impact if actual results differ from assumptions 
in the determination of the fair value of the put option at september   we have assumed a probability of exercise by visa europe at some point in the future and an estimated long term p e differential at the time of exercise of approximately x 
the use of a probability of exercise that is higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in the value of the put option 
an increase of x in the assumed p e differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in the value of the put option 
the put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of visa europe 
as such  the put option liability is included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at september  classification in current liabilities is not an indication of management expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within months 
legal and regulatory matters critical estimates 
we are currently involved in various legal proceedings  the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time 
management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss  if any  in preparing our financial statements 
assumptions and judgment 
we evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party 
we record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings  the merits of our defenses and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates 

table of contents our retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of  or final judgments in  the covered litigation 
the plan mechanisms include the use of the litigation escrow account 
the accrual related to the covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance 
we did not record an accrual for the covered litigation during fiscal see note retrospective responsibility plan and note legal matters to our consolidated financial statements 
impact if actual results differ from assumptions 
due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate  our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes  which could have material adverse effects on our business  financial conditions and results of operations 
see note legal matters to our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes critical estimates 
in calculating our effective income tax rate  we make judgments regarding certain tax positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions 
assumptions and judgment 
we have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits  the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
we are also required to inventory  evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained  or may only be partially sustained  upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities 
impact if actual results differ from assumptions 
although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable  actual results may differ from these estimates 
some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities 
if one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded  and we were unable to realize this benefit  it could have a material and adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors 
our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and equity prices 
aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis 
foreign currency exchange rate risk although most of our activities are transacted in us dollars  we are exposed to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are primarily related to adverse changes in the us dollar value of revenues generated from foreign currency denominated transactions and adverse changes in the us dollar value of payments in foreign currencies  primarily for expenses at our non us locations 
we manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the us dollar equivalent of anticipated non us dollar denominated cash flows 
our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces  but does not entirely eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
the aggregate notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program  including contracts not designated for cash flow hedge accounting  were billion and million at september  and  respectively 
the aggregate notional amount outstanding at september   is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold 
however  actual results could materially differ from our forecast 
the effect of a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar is estimated to create an additional fair value gain or loss of approximately million on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at september  see note summary of significant accounting policies and note derivative financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements 
we are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities 
this risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions 
risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures  including the utilization of visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties 

table of contents interest rate risk our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed rate and adjustable rate securities 
these assets are included in cash equivalents and short term or long term available for sale investments 
investments in fixed rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
the fair value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
additionally  a falling rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature  the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate  generating less interest income 
historically  we have been able to hold investments until maturity 
neither our operating results or cash flows have been  nor are expected to be  materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates 
the fair value balances of our fixed rate investment securities at september  and were billion and billion  respectively 
a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would create an estimated change in fair value of approximately million on our fixed rate investment securities at september  the fair value balances of our adjustable rate debt securities were billion and million at september  and  respectively 
visa europe put option we have a liability related to the put option with visa europe which is recorded at fair value at september  we are required to record any change in the fair value of the put option on a quarterly basis 
in the determination of the fair value of the put option at september   we have assumed a probability of exercise by visa europe at some point in the future and a p e differential  at the time of exercise  of approximately x 
the use of a probability of exercise higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in the value of the put option 
an increase of x in the assumed p e differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in the value of the put option 
see liquidity and capital resources and critical accounting estimates above 
pension plan risk our us defined benefit pension plan assets were billion and million and projected benefit obligations were million and million at september  and  respectively 
a material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and or the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan  an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding 
we will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan assets and market conditions as we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the pension plan for fiscal  if any  which would be made in september
