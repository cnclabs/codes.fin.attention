overview we are the largest specialty retailer of boating supplies and accessories with net revenues of million and net income of million 
our business strategy is to offer a broad assortment of merchandise for the boat and for the boater that meets the needs of individual boaters and boating businesses  provides great customer experiences and offers the convenience of multi channel shopping 
we are focused on the following key growth strategies during ecommerce we are focusing on becoming an omni channel retailer in order to maximize our future sales opportunities by offering exceptional service and convenience to our customers no matter how they prefer to shop with us 
during  we began making additional investments and changes in the organization to better support our ecommerce business and integrate it with our store retail operations in such key areas as marketing and merchandising 
we also made changes in our promotional strategies such as a reduced hurdle for free shipping  and rolled out our improved buy on line ship to store offering  all of which appear to have been met with good customer response 
we experienced accelerating sales results during the year  with quarterly sales changes for the first  second  third and fourth quarters of equaling    and  respectively  when compared to comparable periods in merchandise expansion this strategy builds on our core products and is intended to welcome a broader base of customers who are passionate about recreating on and around the water by providing customers a broader selection of authentic footwear  apparel  clothing accessories  fishing products and paddle sports equipment that satisfy the need for function both on and off the boat 
we are offering this expanded assortment both in our larger format stores and on our ecommerce website 
during  this group of products comprised approximately of our net revenues  compared to approximately last year  and overall product sales growth was 
real estate optimization with this strategy  we are evolving to having fewer  larger and more dominant stores in our major markets 
these stores drive sales and profitability by allowing us to offer an improved shopping experience with greatly expanded assortments in generally better store locations 
the larger scale of these locations also allows us to staff the stores with sales associates with more specialized product knowledge 
during  we opened ten stores in connection with this program 
for the year  the net increase in sales at stores in optimized markets was million 
the net difference in retail square footage was a decrease of  but sales at these ten locations grew by 
we will be investing significant resources in support of these key growth strategies 
this will include capital investments 
table of contents to improve our ecommerce website and to upgrade our information technology infrastructure to support our shift toward an omni channel retail model designed to provide a seamless customer experience across all shopping channels 
we will also incur additional investments in staffing to support execution in key areas such as information technology and ecommerce 
in addition  there will be incremental investment in marketing which  along with a reallocation of some of our traditional media spending  is intended to reach out to a broader range of customers and grow our customer base 
these strategies and investments are expected to better position us to deliver incremental sales and operating margin improvement over time 
we currently have three reportable segments stores  port supply  and direct to consumer 
our stores segment generated approximately of our net revenues 
our company operated stores open at the end of are located in states  puerto rico and canada 
in addition  we have five franchised stores located in turkey 
our port supply segment is one of the largest wholesale distributors of marine equipment in the united states 
products shipped to port supply customers directly from our distribution centers represented approximately of our net revenues 
our direct to consumer segment  which includes our retail ecommerce  direct mail catalogs and call center operations  offers customers around the world approximately  products  and it accounted for the remaining of our net revenues 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain income statement components expressed as a percent of net revenues net revenues cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expense store closures and other restructuring costs impairment of long lived assets income from operations interest expense income before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income fiscal compared with fiscal net revenues for were million  an increase of  compared to net revenues of million for this increase was primarily due to a million increase in comparable store sales and a million increase related to our store optimization strategy  as discussed further below under segment revenues 
from a merchandise perspective  sales increased in the electronics and fishing categories  which are primarily discretionary items  as well as in the apparel categories  which we attribute to our merchandise expansion strategy 
we expect consumers will continue to carefully evaluate their needs based boating purchases and their spending on discretionary items 
in response  we will continue to focus on and invest in our ecommerce  merchandise expansion and store optimization strategies described above while closely managing selling  general and administrative sg a expense 
net income for was million compared to net income for of million 
the decrease in net income was primarily attributable to the release of substantially all of our valuation allowance in segment revenues net revenues for the stores segment increased million  or  to million in  primarily due to a million  or increase in comparable store sales 
a driver of the comparable store sales was higher sales to wholesale customers through our store locations  which we believe resulted from our ongoing efforts to better serve this group of customers 
in certain markets  our larger stores serve as hubs or regional distribution centers that offer better assortments and convenience with personal service and more delivery options for wholesale customers 
real estate activity connected with our store optimization strategy drove a million increase in net revenues as stores opened during the fourth quarter of and stores opened during generated million in sales  whereas stores closed during these same periods generated net revenues of million last year  thereby effectively reducing revenues by such amount 
during  we expect to open approximately two to four flagship stores  approximately four large format stores and one standard sized store  additionally  we plan to expand two existing stores with one becoming a flagship and the other a large 
table of contents format store 
we also expect to close approximately to existing stores in connection with our real estate optimization strategy of evolving to having fewer  larger stores in many of our key markets 
as a result of these actions  we expect that our overall store count will decline and our total selling square footage will increase slightly 
in addition  we will continue with our practice of monitoring the operating performance and economics of all store locations and evaluating for closure any underperforming stores when the economics and other factors favor doing so 
port supply segment net revenues through our distribution centers decreased million  or  to million in compared to however  sales to the wholesale customer group increased in our stores segment 
we believe the shift from port supply to stores was driven by our ongoing efforts to better serve our wholesale customers through our store locations 
net revenues from our direct to consumer segment increased million  or  to million from higher sales through our website 
the increased sales resulted from continued improvements to both our website and product delivery options as well as expanded product assortments 
these enhancements drove higher traffic to the website and resulted in higher average order values per transaction 
comparable store sales comparable store sales for increased by  or million  compared to comparable store sales changes during the first  second  third and fourth quarters of were 
 and  respectively 
the overall comparable store trends were positive and relatively consistent across all geographic regions 
our merchandise expansion strategy contributed to the positive comparable store sales in all regions  with the footwear  apparel and fishing categories performing above the total comparable store results 
in all regions  we continue to identify opportunities to expand and customize our fishing assortments  which have delivered sales growth in that category 
while it appears the economy has stabilized generally  there remains some cautiousness surrounding the market for discretionary items  such as boating supplies and related merchandise 
gross profit gross profit increased by million  or  to million in  compared to million for  primarily due to higher sales

interest expense interest expense was million in  slightly down from million in this expense consists primarily of the amortization of commitment fees  as our borrowings were minimal in cash provided by operating activities funded property and equipment investments with excess cash being used to pay down our seasonal use of debt 
this was the primary driver of the outstanding bank borrowings in income taxes our effective income tax rate for was a provision of  compared to a benefit of in the year over year change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the release of substantially all of our valuation allowance during the second quarter of  resulting in a million benefit in that year

during the first half of the year  sales of usage based items  such as maintenance  engine parts and electrical products  were lower than the prior due to inclement weather in many markets  however  as we progressed through the remainder of the fiscal year  we saw increased sales and ended the year with higher sales in these categories 
net income for was million compared to net income for of million 
the increase in net income was attributable to the release of substantially all of our valuation allowance discussed below under income taxes and net revenues growth outpacing the costs of goods sold

port supply segment net revenues through our distribution centers decreased million  or  to million in compared to however  sales to the wholesale customer group increased in our stores segment 
net revenues from our direct to consumer segment increased million  or  to million from higher sales through our website 
the increased sales resulted from technology upgrades completed in  expanded marketing offerings and product assortments  which drove higher traffic to the website and resulted in higher average order values per transaction 
comparable store sales comparable store sales for increased by  or million  compared to comparable store sales changes during the first  second  third and fourth quarters of were   and  respectively 
the overall comparable store trends were positive across geographic regions  with the strongest growth in the southeast

gross profit gross profit increased by million  or  to million in  compared to million for  primarily due to higher sales 
gross profit increased as a percentage of net revenues by to in  compared to in  primarily due to a reduction in unit buying and distribution costs and a improvement in inventory shrink 
additionally  increased revenues allowed us to leverage our relatively fixed occupancy expenses by 
these improvements were partially offset by lower raw product margin  down  driven by a shift in revenues to lower margin categories  such as electronics

these increases in sg a were partially offset by a million reduction in accrued bonus expense in due to increased bonus target thresholds  reflecting higher performance expectations when compared to the target thresholds for fiscal interest expense interest expense increased million  or  to million in  compared to million in the increase in interest expense was due to both higher commitment fees and higher average interest rates  although average outstanding bank borrowings were lower in  compared to cash provided by operating activities funded property and

this was the primary driver of the lower average outstanding bank borrowings in income taxes our effective income tax rate for was a benefit of  compared to a provision of in the year over year change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the release of substantially all of our valuation allowance during the second quarter of  resulting in a million benefit 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in past fiscal years and our forecast of future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we have operations 
given our improved financial performance in and expectations of future results at the time  we determined that there was sufficient positive evidence to support the release of the majority of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the second quarter of for more information  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our use of cash to fund working capital  operating expenses  debt service and capital expenditures related primarily to the build out of new stores and improvements in our information technology infrastructure 
funds generated by operating activities  available cash and our credit facility are our largest sources of cash 
at the end of both and  we were debt free 
however  we may borrow against our credit facility during the first half of each year as we build inventory levels in preparation for the key boating season 
working capital  the excess of current assets over current liabilities  increased to million at the end of  compared to million at the end of the increase in working capital primarily was attributable to a million higher cash balance at the end of in addition to the higher cash balance  assets held for sale increased by million as the result of a reclassification from property and equipment 
this reclassification was the result of an agreement we entered into to sell the vacant land and building of our former ft 
lauderdale store  which closed when we opened our new flagship store in that market in november during the interim time  we had been marketing the site for lease 
working capital was also higher by million at year end due to lower accounts payable  which were lower due to the timing year over year of inventory purchases 
operating activities during  our primary source of liquidity was cash flow from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased year over year by million to million in  compared to million last year 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to changes in operating assets and liabilities  including increases of prepayments and other receivables compared to the prior year and decreases in accounts payable resulting from the timing of payments to vendors 
prepayments and other receivables increased due to payments for sales taxes and bank fees 
additionally  we experienced net income of million in versus net income of million in non cash charges to earnings in included depreciation and amortization of million  stock based compensation of million and deferred income taxes of million 
during  our primary source of liquidity was cash flow from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities increased year over year by million to million in  compared to million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to increases in cash provided by net income and reduced inventory levels  partially offset by an increase in cash used for accrued expenses 
cash used for inventory was lower due primarily to our continued focus on inventory management and ensuring the correct product assortment in each store based on customer demographics 
cash used for accrued expenses partially offset the increase in cash primarily as a result of lower accrued bonus expense given our increased bonus target thresholds in as compared to accrued bonus and related thresholds in fiscal investing activities in  our capital expenditures were million  primarily for new stores  store remodels  information technology and investment in supply chain efficiencies 
we opened new stores and remodeled four stores in during  we expect to significantly increase capital spending  primarily in support of strategic growth initiatives which include new stores  store remodels and expansions  investing in our ecommerce website and information technology enhancements 
we intend to fund our expansion through cash generated from operations and  if necessary  credit facility borrowings 
financing activities 
table of contents net cash provided by financing activities was million in  primarily consisting of a million increase in cash from associate share based compensation plans  partially offset by million in cash used to pay loan costs associated with the first amendment to our amended and restated loan agreement 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  attributed entirely to an increase in cash related to associate share based compensation plans 
credit agreement on november   we and certain of our subsidiaries  along with the lenders that are signatories thereto and wells fargo bank  national association as successor by merger to wells fargo retail finance  llc  as agent for the lenders  entered into a first amendment to our amended and restated loan and security agreement  to  among other things  amend the procedures by which we may request the issuance of letters of credit  reduce the interest rates applicable to borrowings under our amended and restated loan and security agreement  reduce the fee that we must pay on undrawn availability  extend the maturity of the agreement to november   and at our request  reduce the maximum available borrowing capacity from million to million 
in addition  at our option and subject to certain conditions  we may increase our borrowing capacity up to an additional million 
all other material terms of the amended and restated loan and security agreement remained unchanged 
the amount available to be borrowed is based on a percentage of our inventory excluding capitalized indirect costs and accounts receivable 
the revolving credit facility is available for general working capital and general corporate purposes 
at our election  borrowings under the revolving credit facility will bear interest at one of the following options the prime rate  which is defined in the loan agreement as the highest of a 
federal funds rate  as in effect from time to time  plus one half of one percent  b 
libor rate for a one month interest period plus one percent  or c 
the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by wells fargo as its prime rate  or the libor rate quoted by the british bankers association for the applicable interest period 
in each case  the applicable interest rate is increased by a margin imposed by the loan agreement 
the applicable margin for any date will depend upon the amount of available credit under the revolving credit facility 
the margin range for option above is between and and for option above is between and 
the loan agreement also imposes a fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility available 
for  and  the weighted average interest rate on all of our outstanding borrowings was  and  respectively 
although the loan agreement contains customary covenants  including  but not limited to  restrictions on our ability to incur liens  make acquisitions and investments  pay dividends and sell or transfer assets  it does not contain debt or other similar financial covenants  such as maintaining certain specific leverage  debt service or interest coverage ratios 
instead  our loan is asset based which means our lenders maintain a security interest in our inventory and accounts receivable which serve as collateral for the loan  and the amount we may borrow under our revolving credit facility at any given time is determined by the estimated value of these assets as determined by the lenders appraisers 
additionally  we must maintain a minimum revolving credit availability equal to the greater of million or of the borrowing base 
in addition  there are customary events of default under our loan agreement  including failure to comply with our covenants 
if we fail to comply with any of the covenants contained in the loan agreement  an event of default occurs which  if not waived by our lenders or cured within the applicable time periods  results in the lenders having the right to accelerate repayment of all outstanding indebtedness under the loan agreement before the stated maturity date and the revolving credit facility could be terminated 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants under our loan agreement 
at the end of and  there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facilities  and we had million and million  respectively  available for future borrowings 
at the end of and  we had million and million  respectively  of outstanding commercial and stand by letters of credit 
we strategically manage our debt over the course of our fiscal year 
we incur seasonal fluctuations in our cash flows and  therefore  we incur debt as we build up our inventories for spring in order to maintain stock levels sufficient to fulfill customer needs and maximize sales during the main boating season 
additionally  we hire a significant number of temporary associates during the summer  our peak selling season 
our weighted average outstanding balances for the first quarters of and were million and million  respectively 
for our second quarters of and  the weighted average outstanding balances were million and million  respectively  and the third quarter weighted average outstanding balances for both and were not material 
the fourth quarter weighted average outstanding balances for both and were not material 
we may borrow against our aggregate borrowing base up to the maximum revolver amount  which was million at year end and million at year end our borrowing base at each of our last two fiscal year ends consisted of the following in millions 
table of contents accounts receivable availability inventory availability less reserves less minimum availability total borrowing base our aggregate borrowing base was reduced by the following obligations in millions ending loan balance overpayment outstanding letters of credit total obligations accordingly  our availability as of fiscal year end and  respectively  was in millions total borrowing base less obligations total availability contractual obligations aggregate information about our unconditional contractual obligations as of december  is presented in the following table in thousands 
payments due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual cash obligations operating leases purchase commitments bank letters of credit other long term liabilities operating lease amounts in this table represent minimum amounts due under existing agreements and exclude costs of insurance  taxes  repairs and maintenance 
all but a limited number of our purchase commitments are cancelable by us without penalty  however  we do intend to honor these commitments 
we are party to various arrangements that are conditional in nature and obligate us to make payments only upon the occurrence of certain events  such as delivery of functioning software products 
because it is not possible to predict the timing or amounts that may be due under these conditional arrangements  no such amounts have been included in the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements operating leases are the only financing arrangements not reported on our consolidated balance sheets 
we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as special purpose entities or variable interest entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any unconsolidated special purpose entities or variable interest entities 
seasonality 
table of contents historically  our business has been highly seasonal 
in  approximately of our net sales and all of our net income occurred during the second and third quarters  principally during the period from april through august  which represents the peak months for boat buying  usage and maintenance in most of our markets 
business trends during  we continued to deliver consistent sales growth in each fiscal quarter 
we believe this resulted from a combination of internal and external factors 
early in the year  we benefited from a relatively warm and dry spring in many of our markets  which drove sales of maintenance and other usage related merchandise categories 
as previously disclosed  we did not experience a material adverse impact on our results attributable to hurricane sandy  which affected the northeastern part of the country in early november 
we saw a significant impact on results from our key growth strategies in ecommerce  merchandise expansion and real estate optimization  as outlined in the overview section above 
in  in addition to focusing on implementing and building upon our key growth strategies  we also will continue to manage our business conservatively from an operating expense standpoint  while taking steps to remain flexible and to maximize sales in the face of varying marketplace demand 
although we believe we have seen some recovery in customer boat usage and demand for higher priced items  we believe that the ongoing uncertainty in economic conditions has had  and may continue to have  an adverse impact on discretionary consumer spending in an already challenging climate for the boating industry  and we believe that economic uncertainty could continue to have an impact on our sales  with corresponding risks to our earnings and cash flow in see the fiscal compared with fiscal segment revenues discussion above 
for  we will continue to control expense growth and maximize cash flow by continuing to control our operating expenses through variable expense management  along with reengineering and streamlining business processes  where applicable  continuing to improve the quality of our inventory by tightly controlling overstocked or discontinued goods  proceeding with our ongoing real estate optimization program  evolving to having fewer  larger stores with anticipated improved store economics  managing the business to the budget established for  which reflects prudent investment in growth while focusing on expense control and emphasizing working capital management  and exploring methods and strategies to drive traffic  sales  conversion  and market presence 
more broadly  in order to better meet the needs of our customers and provide a better customer experience  we will be investing significant resources in support of our key growth strategies  including a to increase in our capital investments as compared to the majority of these additional investments are targeted to improve our ecommerce website and to continue to upgrade our information technology infrastructure 
these strategies and investments support our shift toward an omni channel retail model designed to provide a seamless customer experience across all shopping channels and to better position us to deliver incremental sales and operating margin improvement over time 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of west marine s financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
we believe our application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are periodically reevaluated and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  in item of this report 
management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions inventory valuation adjustments we value our merchandise inventories at the lower of the cost or market value on an average cost basis 
inventory cost is written down to market value when cost exceeds market value  which we estimate using current levels of aged and discontinued product and historical analysis of items sold below cost 
lower of cost or market adjustments included in ending inventory at december  and december  were million and million  respectively 
our lower of cost or market adjustments contain uncertainties because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding forecasted consumer demand  the promotional environment  technological obsolescence and consumer preferences 
we have not made any material changes in our inventory valuation methodology during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our lower of cost or market adjustments 
however  if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to losses that could be material 
if we had to take additional markdowns of on all items included in merchandise inventory write downs at december   net income would be affected by approximately million in the fiscal year then ended 
inventory capitalized indirect costs inventory cost includes certain indirect costs related to the purchasing  transportation and warehousing of merchandise 
capitalized indirect costs include freight charges for moving merchandise to warehouses or store locations and operating costs of our merchandising  replenishment and distribution activities 
we recognize indirect costs included in inventory value as an increase in cost of goods sold as the related products are sold 
indirect costs included in inventory value at december  and december  were million and million  respectively 
our capitalized indirect costs contain uncertainties because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment relating to factors of our cost accounting system  the soundness of the underlying principles and their consistent application 
in interim periods  the calculation of capitalized indirect costs requires management to estimate capitalized indirect costs  merchandise purchases and inventory levels for the full fiscal year 
we have not made any material changes in our capitalized indirect cost methodology during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future assumptions or estimates we use to calculate our capitalized indirect costs 
however  if our assumptions or estimates are inaccurate  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a difference in our expenses included in capitalized indirect costs at december  would have affected net income by approximately million in the fiscal year then ended 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions vendor allowances receivable we establish a receivable and reduce inventory cost for income generated from vendor sponsored programs  or vendor allowances  that is earned but not yet received from our vendors  which we calculate based on provisions of the programs in place 
due to the complexity of the individual agreements with vendors  we perform detailed analyses and review historical trends to determine an appropriate level for the vendor allowances receivable 
our receivable for vendor allowances at december  and december  was million and million  respectively  and is included in other current assets 
our vendor allowances receivable contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors  including our ability to collect amounts due from vendors and in interim periods requires management to estimate future inventory purchases 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our vendor allowances receivable during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our vendor allowances receivable 
however  if our assumptions or estimates are inaccurate  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a difference in our estimate of our ability to collect vendor allowances at december  would have affected net income by approximately million in the fiscal year then ended 
costs associated with exit activities we occasionally vacate stores prior to the expiration of the related lease 
for vacated locations that are under long term leases  we record an expense for the net present value of the difference between our future lease payments and related costs eg  real estate taxes and common area maintenance from the date of closure through the end of the remaining lease term  net of expected future sublease rental income 
our estimate of future cash flows is based on our analysis of the specific real estate market  including input from real estate firms  and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict 
costs associated with exit activities included in accrued expenses at december  and december  were million and million  respectively 
our location closing liability contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the duration of future vacancy periods  the amount and timing of future settlement payments and the amount and timing of potential sublease rental income 
when making these assumptions  management considers a number of factors  including historical settlement experience  the owner of the property  the location and condition of the property  the terms of the underlying lease  the specific marketplace demand and general economic conditions 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our location closing liability during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our location closing liability 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a change in our location closing liability or to our estimated sub lease income at december  would have affected net earnings by approximately million in the fiscal year then ended 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions impairment of long lived assets long lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  which are separately tested for impairment  are reviewed and evaluated quarterly 
when evaluating long lived assets for potential impairment  we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we calculate an impairment loss 
the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value  which may be based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset s carrying value exceeds the asset s estimated fair value 
if we recognize an impairment loss  the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis 
we may also accelerate depreciation over the asset s revised useful life if it is identified for replacement or abandonment at a specific future date 
in fiscal year we did not have any non cash charges for impairment of long lived assets 
in fiscal year  we recorded a non cash charge of less than million for impairment of long lived assets 
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment in order to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting useful lives of the assets 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated future cash flows projected in the evaluation of long lived assets can vary within a wide range of outcomes 
we believe we have approximately million in net carrying value of assets held for use where an impairment charge is reasonably possible within the next twelve months 
we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long lived asset impairment losses 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to losses that could be material 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions income taxes we estimate our annual effective income tax rate based on projected taxable income for the full year and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the anticipated annual rate 
our effective tax rate is subject to change based on the mix of income from different state and foreign jurisdictions that tax at different rates  as well as the change in status or outcome of tax audits 
our income tax returns are periodically audited by the taxing authority in the jurisdictions in which we operate  these audits include questions regarding our tax filings  including the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of income among the various jurisdictions 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
as such  we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our effective tax rate and our income tax exposure 
our effective income tax rate is affected by changes in tax law in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate  tax jurisdictions of new stores  company earnings and the results of tax audits 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions liabilities for self insurance or high deductible losses we are self insured for certain losses  including those related to employee healthcare 
however  we obtain third party insurance coverage to limit our exposure to these claims 
in other cases  we purchase commercial insurance  such as for workers compensation and general liability claims 
we insure workers compensation losses through a high deductible program  and we recognize our liability for the ultimate payment of incurred claims and claims adjustment expenses by accruing liabilities on an actuarial basis which represent estimates of future amounts necessary to pay claims and related expenses with respect to covered events that have occurred 
when estimating our liabilities relating to self insurance or high deductible insurance programs  we consider a number of factors  including historical claims experience  severity factors and actuarial analysis 
periodically  management reviews its assumptions and the valuations provided by actuarial analysis to determine the adequacy of our self insured liabilities 
liabilities for our self insured losses or high deductible insurance programs contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date 
we have not made any material changes to our self insurance accrual methodology during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate these liabilities 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a change in our self insured liabilities and loss reserves relating to high deductible insurance programs at december   would have affected net income by approximately million in the fiscal year then ended 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions share based compensation we have a share based compensation plan under which we award non qualified stock options and restricted stock 
we also have an associate stock buying plan 
for more information  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
we determine the fair value of our non qualified stock option awards at the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
we determine the fair value of our restricted stock awards and associate stock buying plan purchases using similar valuation techniques and the closing market price of our common stock 
the fair value of our restricted stock units is based on the closing market price of our common stock 
option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price  expected dividend yield  future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 
we have not made any material changes in our methodology for determining fair value of stock options during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine share based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to changes in share based compensation expense that could be material 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used  the share based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the share based compensation 
a change in our assumptions  such as volatility or expected term  for share based compensation expense for the fiscal year ended december   would have affected net income by less than million in the fiscal year then ended 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not undertake any specific actions to diminish our exposure to interest rate or currency rate risk  and we are not a party to any interest rate or currency rate risk management transactions 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments 
we believe there has been no material change in our exposure to market risk from that discussed in the form k 
at the end of the  we had no outstanding long term debt and as such would not be impacted by a change in interest rates 
in the fourth quarter of  we entered into a five year  amended and restated loan and security agreement pursuant to which the company has up to million in borrowing capacity  there are various interest rate options available  for more information  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
our only significant risk exposure is from us dollar to canadian dollar exchange rate fluctuations 
a increase in the exchange rate of the us dollar versus the canadian dollar would have an effect of reducing our pre tax income and cash flows by approximately million over the next year
