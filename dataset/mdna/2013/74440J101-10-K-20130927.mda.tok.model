table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page f of this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance  that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated or implied in these forward looking statements as a result of many important factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under item a  risk factors  and elsewhere in this report 
overview we develop tiny  sustained release products designed to deliver drugs and biologics at a controlled and steady rate for weeks  months or years 
utilizing our core technology platforms  durasert and biosilicon  we are focused on treatment of chronic diseases of the back of the eye and are also exploring applications outside ophthalmology 
we have developed three of the four sustained release products for treatment of retinal diseases currently approved in the us or european union eu  and our lead product candidate began a phase iii clinical trial in june our strategy includes developing products independently while continuing to leverage our technology platforms through collaboration and license agreements 
iluvien  our most recently approved product  is an injectable  sustained release micro insert that provides treatment of vision impairment associated with chronic diabetic macular edema dme considered insufficiently responsive to available therapies over a period of up to three years 
iluvien is licensed to and sold by alimera sciences  inc alimera  and we are entitled to a share of the net profits  as defined  from alimera s sales of iluvien for dme 
alimera commenced the commercial launch of iluvien for dme in the uk and germany in the second quarter of and expects to launch in france in the first quarter of the international diabetes federation has estimated that approximately million people have diabetes in the seven eu countries where iluvien has received or been recommended for marketing authorization  of which alimera has estimated that approximately million people suffer from vision loss associated with dme 
alimera is also seeking marketing approval for iluvien for dme in the us in the second quarter of  alimera received a new prescription drug user fee act pdufa goal date of october  after resubmitting its new drug application nda for iluvien for dme 
the resubmission responded to a second complete response letter crl received from the us food and drug administration fda in november medidur  our lead development product  commenced the first of our two planned phase iii clinical trials for the treatment of chronic non infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye posterior uveitis in june medidur uses the same durasert micro insert used in iluvien and delivers a lower dose of the same drug as our fda approved retisert for posterior uveitis  which is licensed to bausch lomb 
we are developing medidur independently 
we are also developing a bioerodible  injectable micro insert delivering latanoprost the latanoprost product to treat glaucoma and ocular hypertension 
under an amended collaboration agreement  pfizer has an option  under certain circumstances  to license the development and commercialization of the latanoprost product worldwide 
we are engaged in pre clinical research with respect to both our biosilicon and durasert technology platforms 
the primary focus of our biosilicon technology research is the sustained delivery of peptides  proteins  antibodies and other large biologic molecules using our tethadur technology in both ophthalmic and non ophthalmic applications 
our research program also includes the use of durasert technology in orthopedic applications and for systemic delivery of therapeutic agents 

table of contents our fda approved retisert provides sustained release treatment of posterior uveitis for approximately two and a half years and is licensed to and sold by bausch lomb 
summary of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience  anticipated results and trends and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
by their nature  these estimates  judgments and assumptions are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and management evaluates them on an ongoing basis for changes in facts and circumstances 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
it is important that the discussion of our operating results that follows be read in conjunction with the critical accounting policies discussed below 
revenue recognition our business strategy includes entering into collaborative license and development agreements for the development and commercialization of product candidates utilizing our technology systems 
the terms of these arrangements typically include multiple deliverables by us for example  granting of license rights  providing research and development services and manufacturing of clinical materials  participating on joint research committees in exchange for consideration to us of some combination of non refundable license fees  funding of research and development activities  payments based upon achievement of clinical development  regulatory and sales milestones and royalties in the form of a designated percentage of product sales or profits 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and based on the selling price of the deliverables 
when deliverables are separable  consideration received is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on the relative selling price of the elements and the appropriate revenue recognition principles are applied to each unit 
the assessment of multiple deliverable arrangements requires judgment in order to determine the appropriate units of accounting  the estimated selling price of each unit of accounting  and the points in time that  or periods over which  revenue should be recognized 
for the year ended june   we reported  of collaborative research and development revenue 
revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
we prospectively adopted the provisions of asu no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu for new and materially modified arrangements originating on or after july  asu requires a vendor to allocate revenue to each unit of accounting in arrangements involving multiple deliverables 
it changes the level of evidence of standalone selling price required to separate deliverables by allowing a vendor to make its best estimate of the standalone selling price of deliverables when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of selling price is not available 

table of contents as discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements  adoption of this accounting pronouncement in fiscal resulted in the recognition of revenue in connection with our collaborative research and license agreement with pfizer that became subject to the new accounting pronouncement after a material modification to the agreement occurred 
as a result of the adoption of asu  deferred revenues associated with this pfizer agreement will be recognized as revenues earlier than would otherwise have occurred 
we concluded that our deliverables under the restated pfizer agreement are conducting the research and development program for the latanoprost product through completion of phase ii the r d program and participation on a joint steering committee jsc 
we treat these as a single deliverable  having concluded that the jsc does not have standalone value separate from the r d program 
we concluded that the pfizer exercise option for the worldwide exclusive license is not a deliverable of the arrangement  due to it being a substantive option and not being priced at a significant and incremental discount 
the total arrangement consideration of the restated pfizer agreement totaled million  which consisted of the million of deferred revenue on our balance sheet at the effective date plus the million upfront payment 
the difference between the total arrangement consideration and the estimated selling price of the combined deliverables  or million  was recognized as collaborative research and development revenue in the quarter ended june   the period of the modification 
the remaining balance is being recognized as revenue using the proportional performance method over the estimated period of our performance obligations under the r d program 
to determine the estimated selling price of the combined deliverable  we applied an estimated margin to our cost projections for the combined deliverable 
a change in the estimated margin or our cost projections would have directly impacted the amount of revenue recognized during fiscal an increase of in our estimated selling price of the combined deliverables would have reduced revenue recognized in fiscal by  and would have increased the amount of deferred revenue recognized in each of fiscal and fiscal by  or  and  respectively 
application of the proportional performance method in any fiscal period would result in an increase or decrease in revenue recognized to the extent that the aggregate projected costs to conduct the r d program decreases or increases  respectively  compared to the previous period 
valuation of intangible assets at december   we recorded a million impairment of our biosilicon intangible and a million impairment of our durasert intangible 
the combination of the crl and the subsequent significant decline in the company s market capitalization were determined to be impairment indicators of the company s finite lived intangible assets 
to assess the recoverability of the these assets which had a carrying value of million at december   we used both market based and income based valuation methodologies  and allocated the resulting fair value of the combined intangible assets to the individual assets based on values determined under the income based approach 
we amortize our intangible assets using the straight line method over their estimated economic lives  which currently extend through calendar year and is expected to result in a charge to operations of approximately  per year 
we believe that the carrying value of our intangible assets will be recouped primarily through expected net cash flows from our existing or future collaboration agreements or through our own product development and commercialization 
we will continue to review our intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the asset carrying values may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of assets are no longer appropriate 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include the following change relative to historical or projected future operating results  modification or termination of our existing collaboration agreements  
table of contents factors affecting the development of products utilizing the intangible assets  changes in the expected use of the intangible assets or the strategy for the overall business  and industry or economic trends and developments 
if an impairment trigger is identified  we determine recoverability of an intangible asset by comparing projected undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value 
if the carrying value is not recoverable  an impairment charge is recorded equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value  and the carrying value is adjusted 
estimated future undiscounted cash flows  which relate to existing contractual agreements as well as projected cash flows from future research and development collaboration agreements utilizing the underlying technology systems  require management s judgment regarding future events and probabilities 
actual results could vary from these estimates 
future adverse changes or other unforeseeable factors could result in an impairment charge with respect to some or all of the carrying value of our intangible assets 
such an impairment charge could materially impact future results of operations and financial position in the reporting period identified 
a significant change in the estimation of the projected undiscounted net cash flows for the products and product candidates utilizing the durasert or biosilicon technology systems  among other things  could result in the further impairment of the carrying value of the respective assets

approximately half of our collaborative research and 
table of contents development revenue was recognition of deferred revenue from collaboration agreements in fiscal compared to substantially all in the prior year 
 of the remaining deferred revenue balance of million at june  is expected to be recognized as revenue during fiscal our retisert royalty income in fiscal increased to million  a increase over the prior year 
substantially all of the royalty income in both years was derived from sales of retisert by bausch lomb 
during fiscal  bausch lomb discontinued sales of vitrasert 
we do not expect retisert royalty income to increase significantly in the future  and it may decline 
research and development research and development totaled million in each of fiscal and fiscal periodic amortization of intangible assets decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal  which resulted from a million intangible asset impairment write down at december  this decrease was substantially offset in fiscal by approximately  of initial costs incurred for the first of two planned pivotal phase iii clinical trials of medidur for posterior uveitis  which commenced in the quarter ended june   and an approximate  increase in personnel costs  which consisted primarily of additional headcount and cash incentive compensation accruals 
we expect to significantly increase our research and development expense in fiscal in connection with patient enrollment for the phase iii clinical trial of medidur 
general and administrative general and administrative costs increased by  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  primarily attributable to  of cash incentive compensation accruals  which compared to zero in the prior year 
this was partially offset by an approximate  decrease in professional fees 
other income other income decreased by  or  to  for fiscal from  for fiscal other income for fiscal consisted primarily of the change in fair value of derivatives of  this income  which reduced the derivative liability balance to zero  was determined using the black scholes valuation model  and resulted from the july expiration of the remaining warrants denominated in australian dollars a  which were recorded as derivative liabilities at issuance and revalued at subsequent period reporting dates 
interest income  net  decreased by  from fiscal to fiscal as a result of lower levels of marketable securities investments and further decreases in yields for investment grade corporate bonds and commercial paper of short maturities 
income tax benefit income tax benefit  which consisted of foreign research and development tax credits  decreased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  primarily attributable to the impact of third party funding of certain qualified research and development costs

we restated the pfizer agreement in fiscal  for which we received million in upfront consideration  resulting in an aggregate million balance of deferred revenue associated with that agreement 
in fiscal  we recognized million of deferred revenue from that agreement  and the remainder is being recognized as revenue using the proportional performance method over the estimated period of our performance obligations under the latanoprost product research program 
collaborative research and development revenue for fiscal of million consisted primarily of deferred revenue recognition of  related to the restated pfizer agreement and million resulting from the termination of a field of use license 
this compares to million of collaborative research and development revenue for fiscal  which was predominantly associated with the restated pfizer agreement 
substantially all of our royalty income in fiscal and fiscal was from sales of retisert 
our total royalty income increased by  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  and approximated million in each year 
our remaining royalty income was from vitrasert sales 
research and development research and development increased by  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel costs and the absence in fiscal of a federal therapeutic discovery grant received in fiscal  substantially offset by decreased amortization of intangible assets in fiscal resulting from a million intangible asset impairment write down at december  
table of contents general and administrative general and administrative costs decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  primarily attributable to decreased stock based compensation including performance stock option forfeitures  professional fees and the absence in fiscal of cash incentive compensation  payment of which was subject to future conditions 
change in fair value of derivatives change in fair value of derivatives represented income of  for fiscal compared to income of million for fiscal warrants denominated in a were recorded as derivative liabilities  subject to revaluation at subsequent reporting dates 
fiscal income from the change in fair value of derivatives was predominantly due to the expiration of approximately million  or  of the a denominated warrants during that year 
the derivative liabilities balance was reduced to zero during fiscal in connection with the july expiration of our last remaining a denominated warrants  with the result that we will not recognize income or loss relating to the change in the fair value of derivatives from these warrants in the future 
income tax benefit income tax benefit decreased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  primarily attributable to the absence in fiscal of a net reduction of deferred tax liabilities and federal alternative minimum tax expense in fiscal  partially offset by higher foreign research and development tax credits 
inflation and seasonality our management believes inflation has not had a material impact on our operations or financial condition and that our operations are not currently subject to seasonal influences 
recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements new accounting pronouncements are issued periodically by the financial accounting standards board fasb and are adopted by us as of the specified effective dates 
unless otherwise disclosed below  we believe that the impact of recently issued and adopted pronouncements will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows or do not apply to our operations 
in june  the fasb issued asu comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income  which provides new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income 
this guidance requires a company to present components of net income loss and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate  but consecutive  statements 
there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income loss or other comprehensive income under current gaap 
the company adopted this standard for the quarter ended september  and has presented the required information in one continuous statement of operations and comprehensive loss on a comparative basis 
other than a change in presentation  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal through fiscal  we financed our operations primarily from registered direct offerings of our equity securities in january and august  as well as operating cash flows from license fees and research and development funding from collaborations 
at june   our principal source of liquidity consisted of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million 
in july  we 
table of contents enhanced our cash resources through the sale  in an underwritten public offering  of  shares of common stock for net proceeds of million 
our cash equivalents are invested in institutional money market funds  and our marketable securities are invested in investment grade corporate debt and commercial paper with maturities at june  ranging from one to seven months 
with the exception of net income in fiscal resulting from a non recurring event  we have incurred operating losses since inception and  at june   we had a total accumulated deficit of million 
we do not currently have any assured sources of revenue and we generally expect negative cash flows from operations on a quarterly basis unless and until such time as we receive sufficient revenues from iluvien for dme or one or more of our other product candidates achieve regulatory approval and provide us sufficient revenues 
we believe that our capital resources of million at june   together with the million of net proceeds from our july share offering  expected retisert royalty income and other expected cash inflows under existing collaboration and evaluation agreements will enable us to fund our operations as currently planned through calendar year this includes expected costs through that date of phase iii clinical trials of medidur for posterior uveitis  but does not include any potential milestone or net profit receipts under the alimera collaboration agreement 
our capital resources would be enhanced if alimera successfully commercializes iluvien for dme in the eu and if iluvien for dme were approved and successfully commercialized in the us  although even so  the amount and timing of any such receipts is uncertain 
accordingly  we expect to need additional resources to fund our planned phase iii trials for medidur for posterior uveitis  as well as other research and development and operations 
whether we will require  or desire  to raise additional capital will be influenced by many factors  including  but not limited to whether  when and to what extent we receive revenues from alimera with respect to iluvien for dme  including from commercialization in the eu or upon any approval or commercialization in the us  the timing and cost of development of medidur for posterior uveitis  whether and when we initiate phase ii clinical trials for the latanoprost product and pfizer exercises its option  whether and the extent to which we internally fund  when we initiate  and how we conduct product development and programs  including with respect to biosilicon and tethadur applications  whether and when we are able to enter into strategic arrangements for products and the nature of those arrangements  timely and successful development  regulatory approval and commercialization of our products and product candidates  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing any patent claims  and changes in our operating plan  resulting in increases or decreases in our need for capital 
absent adequate levels of funding from existing and potential future collaboration or other agreements and or financing transactions  management currently believes that our cash position beyond calendar year depends significantly on possible revenues from the successful commercialization by alimera of iluvien for dme in the eu and  if approved by the fda  in the us however  there is no assurance that the fda or other additional regulatory authorities will approve iluvien for dme  that it will achieve market acceptance in any market or that we will receive significant  if any  revenues from iluvien for dme 
exercise by pfizer of its option for the latanoprost product would also enhance our cash position  although there is no assurance when the option will become exercisable or if pfizer will exercise it 
if we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital in the future  we do not know if it will be available when needed or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
the state of the economy and the financial and credit markets at the time we seek additional financing may make it more difficult and more 
table of contents expensive to obtain 
if available  additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  debt financing may involve restrictive covenants or other unfavorable terms and potential dilutive equity  and funding through collaboration agreements may be on unfavorable terms  including requiring us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products 
if adequate financing is not available if and when needed  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate research or development programs  postpone or cancel the pursuit of product candidates  including pre clinical and clinical trials and new business opportunities  reduce staff and operating costs or otherwise significantly curtail our operations to reduce our cash requirements and extend our capital 
our consolidated statements of historical cash flows are summarized as follows year ended june  in thousands net loss changes in operating assets and liabilities other adjustments to reconcile net loss to cash flows from operating activities cash flows used in operating activities cash flows provided by used in investing activities cash flows provided by financing activities sources and uses of operating cash flows for the years ended june   and are summarized as follows year ended june  in thousands operating cash inflows license and collaboration agreements royalty income foreign r d tax credits federal r d grants investment interest received  net operating cash outflows personnel costs professional fees clinical development and third party r d all other operating cash outflows  net cash flows used in operating activities operating cash inflows for each year consisted primarily of payments received pursuant to license and collaboration agreements 
as a percentage of total license and collaboration cash inflows  amounts attributable to pfizer represented in fiscal  amounts attributable to alimera represented in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal  amounts attributable to enigma represented in fiscal and amounts attributable to various technology evaluation agreements represented in fiscal and in fiscal 
table of contents operating cash outflows increased by  or  from fiscal to fiscal  primarily as a result of million of payments with respect to the first phase iii trial of medidur for posterior uveitis  partially offset by the absence in fiscal of approximately  of fiscal cash incentive compensation paid in fiscal and an approximate  decrease in professional fees 
operating cash outflows increased by million  or  from fiscal to fiscal  primarily as a result of increased personnel costs and professional fees 
cash flows from investing activities were primarily attributable to maturities and sales of marketable securities  net of purchases  of million for fiscal and million for fiscal  and to purchases of marketable securities  net of maturities  totaling million for fiscal purchases of property and equipment totaled  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal cash flows from financing activities in fiscal were attributable to million of gross proceeds from the august registered direct offering of shares and warrants  net of approximately  of share issuance costs 
net cash inflows from financing activities in fiscal were predominantly attributable to million of gross proceeds from the january registered direct offering of shares and warrants  net of million of share issuance costs 
in addition  cash flows from financing activities included proceeds from the exercise of stock options totaling  in fiscal and  in fiscal off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that would be material to investors 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our minimum contractual obligations as of june  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations purchase obligations total our operating lease obligations consist predominantly of office and lab space in watertown  massachusetts and malvern  uk our purchase obligations consist of non cancellable purchase orders for supplies and services 
we also have an agreement with a contract research organization cro to conduct the first of two planned phase iii clinical trials of medidur for posterior uveitis 
we were contractually obligated for up to approximately million for services under this agreement as of june  the timing of actual amounts owed under the agreement will depend on various factors  including patient enrollment and other progress of the clinical trial 
we can terminate the agreement at any time  and if terminated  we would not be liable for the full amount of the contract  but rather for services through the termination date plus non cancellable cro obligations to third parties 
we also have employment agreements with our three executive officers that would require us to make severance payments to them if we terminate their employment without cause or the executives resign for good cause 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rates we conduct operations in two principal currencies  the us dollar and the pound sterling 
the us dollar is the functional currency for our us operations  and the pound sterling is the functional currency for our uk operations 
changes in the foreign exchange rate of the pound sterling to the us dollar impact the net operating expenses of our uk operations 
the minimal strengthening of the uk dollar in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted in a net decrease in research and development expense of approximately  for every incremental strengthening or weakening of the weighted average exchange rate of the us dollar in relation to the pound sterling  our research and development expense in fiscal would have decreased or increased by  respectively 
all cash and cash equivalents  and most other asset and liability balances  are denominated in each entity s functional currency and  accordingly  we do not consider our statement of comprehensive loss exposure to realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses to be significant 
changes in the foreign exchange rate of the pound sterling to the us dollar also impacted total stockholders equity 
as reported in the statement of comprehensive loss  the relative strengthening of the us dollar in relation to the pound sterling at june  compared to june  resulted in a net increase of  in other comprehensive loss due to the translation of  of net assets of our uk operations  predominantly the biosilicon technology intangible asset  into us dollars 
for every incremental strengthening or weakening of the us dollar at june  in relation to the pound sterling  our stockholders equity at june  would have decreased or increased  respectively  by approximately
