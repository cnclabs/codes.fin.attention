executive overview as discussed under item  business  we executed the purchase agreement under which we expect to acquire direct and indirect interests in certain operating and development communities from archstone 
we expect this transaction will close in the first quarter of the impact of the archstone acquisition is expected to significantly change the scope of our business and as a result our results of operations may not necessarily be representative of our future results of operations 
unless otherwise stated  all disclosures and discussion in this form k do not include the expected effects of the archstone acquisition 
business description we are primarily engaged in developing  acquiring  owning and operating apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets of the united states 
we believe that apartment communities are an attractive long term investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments  because a broad potential resident base should help reduce demand volatility over a real estate cycle 
however  throughout the real estate cycle  apartment market fundamentals  and therefore operating cash flows  are affected by overall economic conditions 
we seek to create long term shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms  deploying that capital to develop  redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets  operating apartment communities  and selling communities when pricing is attractive or when they no longer meet our long term investment strategy 
barriers to entry in our markets generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply 
our strategy is to be a leader in multifamily market research  consumer insight  and capital allocation  delivering a range of multifamily offerings tailored to serve the needs of the most attractive customer segments in the best performing submarkets of the united states 
our communities are predominately upscale  which generally command among the highest rents in their markets 
we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points  consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services 
we regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our markets 
our current markets include new england  the new york new jersey metro area  the mid atlantic  the pacific northwest  and the northern and southern california regions of the united states 

table of contents financial highlights for the year ended december   net income attributable to common stockholders was  compared to  for  a decrease of 
the decrease was due primarily to decreased gains on sale of communities in as compared to and acquisition costs for the expected archstone acquisition offset partially by an increase in net operating income noi from both established and newly stabilized communities 
apartment fundamentals improved throughout as compared to  driven by a combination of a decline in the home ownership rate  modest employment growth and limited supply of new multifamily rental product 
full year established communities noi increased over the prior year across all of our markets as a result of an increase in rental revenue offset partially by an increase in operating expenses 
during  we raised approximately  of capital through the issuance of common equity and unsecured notes and asset sales 
proceeds were used to prefund our expected portion of the acquisition of archstone  to fund current investment activities and to repay higher cost secured and unsecured debt both at or prior to their stated maturity 
we believe that our current capital structure will continue to provide financial flexibility to access capital on attractive terms 
the funds raised from dispositions consist of the proceeds from the sale of four communities and one land parcel for a gross sales price of  we believe our development activity will continue to create long term value 
we increased development activity during from the prior year in anticipation of favorable economic conditions and apartment fundamentals 
during  we completed the development of eight communities for an aggregate total capitalized cost of  we also started the development of twelve communities  which are expected to be completed for an estimated total capitalized cost of  in addition  during we completed the redevelopment of eleven communities for a total investment of  excluding costs incurred prior to the redevelopment 
we believe that our current level of indebtedness  our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges and our current limited use of financial encumbrances such as secured financing provides flexibility in our capital raising activities 
we expect to meet our liquidity needs from the issuance of unsecured debt and or common and preferred equity and or secured debt  as well as from disposition proceeds  joint venture investments or from retained cash 
these sources will provide adequate access to the capital necessary to fund our development and redevelopment activities during with the completion of the investment period for fund ii in  we became active again in acquiring wholly owned apartment communities  directly purchasing the following four apartment communities during  one of which occurred through a purchase of our joint venture partner interest 
the mark pasadena  located in pasadena  ca  which contains apartment homes  was acquired for a purchase price of  in conjunction with this acquisition  we assumed the existing fixed rate mortgage loan with an outstanding principal amount of  which matures in june and is secured by the community 
eaves cerritos  located in artesia  ca  which contains apartment homes  was acquired for a purchase price of eaves burlington  located in burlington ma  which contains homes  was acquired for a purchase price of the company acquired avalon del rey  a apartment home community which was owned by a joint venture in which we held a ownership interest 
as part of this transaction  the 
table of contents venture repaid the  variable rate note secured by the community 
we paid approximately  for the joint venture partner interest as well as contributing our proportionate share of the note repayment to the venture 
upon the acquisition of avalon del rey  we consolidated the community 
we established fund i and fund ii to engage in acquisition programs through discretionary investment funds 
we believe this investment format provides the following attributes i it enables us to access third party joint venture equity as an additional source of financing to expand and diversify our portfolio  ii it provides us with additional sources of income in the form of property management and asset management fees and  potentially  incentive distributions if the performance of the funds exceeds certain thresholds  and iii it gives us greater visibility into the transactions occurring in multifamily assets  which helps us with other investment decisions related to our wholly owned portfolio 
fund i has nine institutional investors  including us 
one of our wholly owned subsidiaries is the general partner of fund i and  excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of fund i  we have made an equity investment of approximately  in fund i net of distributions and excluding the purchase by us of a mortgage note secured by a fund i community  representing a combined general partner and limited partner equity interest 
fund i was our principal vehicle for acquiring apartment communities from its formation in through the close of its investment period in march fund i has a term that expires in march  plus two one year extension options 
during  fund i sold six communities avalon lakeside  a apartment home community in chicago  il  for  avalon at poplar creek  a apartment home community in chicago  il  for  avalon lombard  a apartment home community in chicago  il  for  avalon paseo place  a apartment home community in fremont  ca  for  avalon skyway  a apartment home community in san jose  ca  for  and avalon at aberdeen station  a apartment home community in aberdeen  nj  for  our proportionate share of the gain from the sale of these communities was  in conjunction with the disposition of these communities  fund i repaid  of the related secured indebtedness in advance of the scheduled maturity dates  incurring charges for prepayment penalties and write off of deferred financing costs  of which our portion was approximately  reported as a reduction of equity in income of unconsolidated entities 
in addition  in  fund i sold avalon at yerba buena  located in san francisco  ca 
avalon at yerba buena contains apartment homes and  square feet of retail space and was sold for fund ii has six institutional investors  including us 
one of our wholly owned subsidiaries is the general partner of fund ii and excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of fund ii  we have made an equity investment of  net of distributions  representing a combined general partner and limited partner equity interest 
fund ii served as the exclusive vehicle through which we acquired investment interests in apartment communities from its formation in through the close of its investment period in august 
table of contents during the year ended december   a subsidiary of fund ii acquired avalon watchung  a apartment home community located in watchung  nj  for  this was the final acquisition for fund ii 
in  fund ii sold avalon rothbury  a apartment home community located in gaithersburg  md  for  we are not presently pursuing the formation of a new  third fund  preferring at this time to maintain flexibility in shaping our portfolio of wholly owned assets through acquisitions and dispositions 
however  we may acquire investments in existing fund structures in connection with the archstone acquisition  but these funds are not expected to limit our ability to acquire investments for our own account 
communities overview as of december   we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in apartment communities containing  apartment homes in nine states and the district of columbia  of which communities were under construction and five communities were under reconstruction 
of these communities  were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes  including owned by subsidiaries of fund i and owned by subsidiaries of fund ii 
in addition  we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in development rights to develop an additional wholly owned communities that  if developed in the manner expected  will contain an estimated  apartment homes 
our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities  development communities  and development rights 
our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities  other stabilized communities  lease up communities and redevelopment communities 
established communities are generally operating communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year  which allows the performance of these communities and the markets in which they are located to be compared between years 
other stabilized communities are generally all other consolidated operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year  but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year 
lease up communities consist of communities where construction is complete but stabilization has not been achieved 
redevelopment communities consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year 
a more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in note  segment reporting  of our consolidated financial statements 
although each of these categories is important to our business  we generally evaluate overall operating  industry and market trends based on the operating results of established communities  for which a detailed discussion can be found in results of operations as part of our discussion of overall operating results 
we evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition  disposition  development  redevelopment and financing activities within other stabilized  redevelopment and development communities 
discussions related to these segments of our business can be found in liquidity and capital resources 
noi of our current operating communities is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance 
noi is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets  our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs 
our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed and acquired apartment communities 

table of contents results of operations our year over year operating performance is primarily affected by both overall and individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals and reflected in changes in noi of our established communities  noi derived from acquisitions and development completions  the loss of noi related to disposed communities  and capital market and financing activity

noi reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy 
table of contents comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets 
in addition  because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures  with varying marginal impacts to overhead as a result of acquiring real estate  noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets 
we define noi as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses  including property taxes 
noi does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap 
therefore  noi should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance 
noi should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities  as determined by gaap  as a measure of liquidity  nor is noi necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
reconciliations of noi for the years ended december   and to net income for each year are as follows dollars in thousands for the year ended net income indirect operating expenses  net of corporate income investments and investment management expense expensed acquisition  development and other pursuit costs interest expense  net loss on extinguishment of debt  net general and administrative expense equity in income of unconsolidated entities depreciation expense casualty and impairment loss gain on sale of real estate assets income loss from discontinued operations gain on acquisition of unconsolidated real estate entity net operating income the noi increases for both and  as compared to the prior year period  consist of changes in the following categories dollars in thousands full year full year established communities other stabilized communities development and redevelopment communities total the noi increase for established communities in is due to a combination of increased rental revenues  offset partially by increased operating expenses 
during  we experienced sequential annual increases in rental rates over  while maintaining occupancy of at least in all markets  offset partially by an increase in operating expenses 
rental and other income increased in both and as compared to the prior years due to additional rental income generated from newly developed and acquired communities and increases in rental rates at our established communities 
overall portfolio the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes increased to  apartment homes for as compared to  homes for and  homes for the increase in over is due to homes available from newly developed and acquired communities  offset partially by communities sold during and the weighted 
table of contents average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased to  for as compared to  in and  in established communities rental revenue increased  or  for and increased  or  for as compared to the respective prior years 
for  the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased to  compared to  in coupled with an increase in economic occupancy of to 
economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community gross revenue 
economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss  as a percentage of gross potential revenue 
gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents 
we experienced increases in rental revenue for all of our established communities regions in as compared to the prior year as discussed in more detail below 
the metro new york new jersey region  which accounted for approximately of established community rental revenue for  experienced an increase in rental revenue of for as compared to average rental rates increased to  over and economic occupancy increased to for as compared to while there has not been significant job growth in the financial services sector of the metro new york new jersey region  job growth in the technology sector continues to support the improvement in apartment fundamentals in new york city and northern new jersey 
the new england region accounted for approximately of the established community rental revenue for and experienced a rental revenue increase of over the prior year 
average rental rates increased to  offset partially by a decrease in economic occupancy of to for as compared to the new england region growth is driven by a renewed expansion in employment for the technology sector  primarily in the greater boston area  offset somewhat by weakness in the financial services sector impacting the fairfield new haven area 
we expect continued but moderating revenue growth  with the increasing affordability of home ownership and future supply from new development impacting the longer term outlook 
northern california accounted for approximately of the established community rental revenue for and experienced a rental revenue increase of over the prior year 
average rental rates increased to  and economic occupancy increased to for as compared to the growth in rental revenue is driven by the strength of northern california technology sector  which we expect will continue in an increase in development activity and future supply may slow revenue growth in future periods 
the mid atlantic region  which represented approximately of established community rental revenue during  experienced an increase in rental revenue of as compared to average rental rates increased by to  and economic occupancy increased to for as compared to the mid atlantic region is facing challenges resulting from additional supply due to new development and the uncertainty surrounding federal spending 
we expect these factors will result in revenue growth at a slower pace relative to our other markets during southern california accounted for approximately of the established community rental revenue for and experienced a rental revenue increase of over the prior year 
average rental rates increased to  and economic occupancy increased to for as compared to the improvement in the southern california market is driven by above average job growth and limited new supply  and we expect this trend will continue into the pacific northwest region accounted for approximately of the established community rental revenue for and experienced a rental revenue increase of over the prior year 
average rental rates increased to  and economic occupancy increased by to for as compared to the pacific northwest retail  technology and manufacturing sectors continue to support job creation and apartment fundamentals 
consistent with several of our other markets  new development and resulting additional supply may moderate revenue growth in future periods 

table of contents management  development and other fees increased  or  in over and  or in over the increases in both years were due primarily to increased asset management fees and property management fees from fund ii over the prior years 
direct property operating expenses  excluding property taxes increased  or in and increased  or for as compared to the prior years  primarily due to the addition of recently developed apartment homes 
for established communities  direct property operating expenses  excluding property taxes  decreased  or for and decreased  or for as compared to the prior years 
the decreases in and from the respective prior years were due to a decrease in utilities from milder temperatures and more favorable negotiated rates as well as decreased bad debt expense 
property taxes increased  or and  or in and  respectively  over the prior years due to the addition of newly developed and redeveloped apartment homes and overall higher assessments 
property tax increases are also impacted by the size and timing of successful tax appeals 
for established communities  property taxes increased by  or and decreased  or  for and  respectively  as compared to the prior year 
the increase in over is due to appeals and settlements recognized in not present in coupled with increases in rates and assessments throughout our regions 
the decrease in from is due to the appeals and settlements recognized in not present in  offset partially by increased rates and assessments across all of our regions 
corporate level property management and other indirect operating expenses increased by  or and  or in and  respectively  over the prior years 
the increases in and from the prior years are due primarily to increases in costs associated with our introduction and implementation of our ava and eaves by avalon brands  and increases in compensation costs 
investments and investment management costs increased by  or and  or in and  respectively  over the prior years due primarily to increases in compensation costs 
expensed acquisition  development and other pursuit costs primarily reflect the costs incurred for acquisitions of operating real estate and abandoned pursuit costs  which include costs incurred for development pursuits not yet considered probable for development  as well as the abandonment of development rights and disposition pursuits 
these costs can be volatile  particularly in periods of increased acquisition activity  periods of economic downturn or when there is limited access to capital  and the costs may vary significantly from period to period 
these costs increased  or in over due primarily to costs associated with the archstone acquisition 
interest expense  net decreased  or and decreased  or in and  respectively as compared to the prior years 
the decreases in and from the prior years are due primarily to decreases in the average outstanding indebtedness and lower average effective interest rates coupled with increases in the amount of capitalized interest 
the increases in capitalized interest over the respective prior years were driven primarily by the increase in our development activity and development pursuits 
the year over year decrease in interest expense  net  in from was offset somewhat by interest income associated with escrow accounts for certain tax exempt secured borrowings recognized in that were not present in loss on the extinguishment of debt  net reflects the impact from prepayment penalties  expensing deferred financing costs from our debt repurchase and retirement activity  or payments above or below 
table of contents the carrying basis  excluding assets sold or held for sale  which is included in discontinued operations  below 
during  we recognized a non cash charge for the write off of deferred financing fees related to the early retirement of a secured note 
in we incurred charges for a prepayment penalty and the write off of deferred financing fees related to the early retirement of a secured note  with no comparable activity in depreciation expense increased in and primarily due to the net increase in assets from the completion of development and redevelopment activities and acquisition activity  offset by a reduction in depreciation expense from assets sold during  and general and administrative expense g a increased  or in and  or in as compared to the prior years 
the increases in both periods are attributable to increased compensation expense and professional fees 
casualty and impairment loss for consists of the losses we incurred associated with superstorm sandy 
amounts for are composed of the write down of two land parcels and an other than temporary impairment of an investment in unconsolidated joint venture 
gain on sale of land decreased in and increased in as compared to the prior years due to the volume and associated gains on the sale of land parcels in each of the respective years 
gain on acquisition of unconsolidated entity represents the amount by which the fair value of our prior ownership interest in the joint venture that owned avalon del rey exceeded our carrying value 
equity in income of unconsolidated entities increased  or in and  or in as compared to prior years 
the increase in is due primarily to the recognition of income from our promoted interest for avalon del rey and an increase in our proportionate share of gains from fund i disposition activity over the prior year periods 
the increase in is due to the recognition of our proportionate share of the gain on sale of communities by fund i  offset partially by increased acquisition costs from fund ii over income from discontinued operations represents the net income generated by communities sold or qualifying as discontinued operations during the period from january  through december  this income increased for and decreased for due to changes in the number of communities sold in each year as compared to the prior year period 
see note  real estate disposition activities  to our consolidated financial statements 
gain on sale of communities decreased in and increased in as compared to the prior years due to a change in the volume of community disposition activity and associated gains as compared to the prior year 
the amount of gain realized upon disposition of a community depends on many factors  including the number of communities sold  the size and carrying value of those communities and the market conditions in the local area 
net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests resulted in income to us from the allocation of losses to the noncontrolling interests of  in and  in the decrease in loss allocated in relative to is due primarily to improved operating results of the fund i community we consolidate 
the conversion and redemption of limited partnership units in and also contributed to the decrease in from  thereby reducing outside ownership interest and the allocation of net losses to outside ownership interests 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we believe our principal short term liquidity needs are to fund the cash consideration due and any costs associated with the expected archstone acquisition as discussed in this form k  or any additional liquidity needs associated with the expected archstone acquisition  development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged  the minimum dividend payments on our common stock required to maintain our reit qualification under the code  debt service and principal payments either at maturity or opportunistically prior to maturity  and normal recurring operating expenses 
factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations  financing activities and investing activities including dispositions as well as general economic and market conditions 
operating cash flow has historically been determined by i the number of apartment homes currently owned  ii rental rates  iii occupancy levels and iv operating expenses with respect to apartment homes 
the timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage  as well as our plans for development  redevelopment  acquisition and disposition activity  are affected by changes in the capital markets environment  such as changes in interest rates or the availability of cost effective capital 
we regularly review our liquidity needs  the adequacy of cash flows from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs 
we continued to have cost effective access to the capital markets during the year ended december  net proceeds of approximately  were provided by capital markets activity in capital raising activities included public equity and debt  including amounts issued in an underwritten public offering of common stock in december  the issuance of unsecured notes in september and december and the issuance of common stock during under cep ii and cep iii  discussed below 
in  we expect to meet all of our liquidity needs from a variety of internal and external sources  including cash balances on hand  asset sales and other public or private sources of liquidity as discussed below  as well as our operating activities 
our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions  the general availability of credit  the overall availability of credit to the real estate industry  our credit ratings and credit capacity  as well as the perception of lenders regarding our long or short term financial prospects 
at december   we have unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of  available to fund the archstone acquisition  to fund current liquidity needs as well as to fund development and acquisition related activities 
unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled  at december   an increase of  from  at december  the following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating  investing and financing activities  which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere in this report 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased to  in from  in the increase was driven primarily by increased cash flows from community operations in as compared to and the timing of general corporate expenditures 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities of  in related to investments in assets through development  redevelopment  and acquisitions  partially offset by 
table of contents proceeds of  from the sale of real estate 
in total  we invested  during in the following areas we invested approximately  in the development and redevelopment of communities  we invested  in the acquisition of four apartment communities  acquisition costs associated with these acquisitions  and costs related to the expected archstone acquisition  and we had capital expenditures of  for real estate and non real estate assets 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities totaled  in the net cash provided is due to  received from the issuance of common stock  primarily through the underwritten common equity offering we executed in november  through cep ii and cep iii  and stock option exercises  and the proceeds from our  and  unsecured notes offerings 
these proceeds were offset partially by  of dividends paid  repayment of unsecured notes of  the repayment of mortgage notes payable of  and the settlement of an interest rate contract for variable rate unsecured credit facility in september  we entered into a  revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of banks the credit facility 
in december  pursuant to an option available under the terms of the credit facility  with the approval of the lending syndicate we expanded the aggregate facility size to  extended the maturity of the credit facility from september to april  and amended other sections of the credit facility the facility increase 
we may further extend the term for up to two additional six month periods for a total extension of one year  provided we are not in default and upon payment of a  extension fee for each extension option 
in connection with the facility increase  the applicable margin over reference rates used to determine the applicable interest rates on our borrowings from time to time decreased 
the credit facility now bears interest at varying levels based on the london interbank offered rate libor  rating levels achieved on our unsecured notes and on a maturity schedule selected by us 
the current stated pricing is libor plus per annum on january  
the stated spread over libor can vary from libor plus to libor plus based on our credit ratings 
in addition  a competitive bid option is available for borrowings up to of the credit facility amount  which allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to make loans at a rate that is lower than the stated rate if market conditions allow 
in connection with the facility increase  the annual facility fee was also amended to lower the fee from to approximately  based on the  facility size and based on our current credit rating 
we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and had  outstanding in letters of credit that reduced our borrowing capacity as of january  financial covenants we are subject to financial and other covenants contained in the credit facility and the indenture under which our unsecured notes were issued 
the financial covenants include the following limitations on the amount of total and secured debt in relation to our overall capital structure  limitations on the amount of our unsecured debt relative to the undepreciated basis of real estate assets that are not encumbered by property specific financing  and 
table of contents minimum levels of debt service coverage 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  in addition  our secured borrowings may include yield maintenance  defeasance  or prepayment penalty provisions  which would result in us incurring an additional charge in the event of a full or partial prepayment of outstanding principal before the scheduled maturity 
these provisions in our secured borrowings are generally consistent with other similar types of debt instruments issued during the same time period in which our borrowings were secured 
continuous equity offering program in november  we commenced our second continuous equity program cep ii  under which we were authorized to sell up to  of our common stock from time to time during a month period 
in conjunction with cep ii  we engaged sales agents who received compensation of approximately of the gross sales price for shares sold 
for the year ended december  we sold  shares under cep ii at an average sales price of per share  for aggregate net proceeds of  from program inception in november through completion in july  we sold  shares at an average price of per share  for aggregate net proceeds of in august  we commenced our third continuous equity program cep iii  under which we may sell up to  of shares of our common stock during a month period 
in conjunction with cep iii we have engaged sales agents who receive compensation of approximately of the gross sales price for shares sold 
from program inception through december   we sold  shares at an average sales price of  for net proceeds of  underwritten public offering of common stock in december  we issued  shares of our common stock at per share 
net proceeds of approximately  are expected to be used to repay a portion of the debt we expect to assume in connection with the archstone acquisition  to fund the cash consideration due in connection with the archstone acquisition  to fund the fees  costs and expenses related thereto or  if the acquisition does not occur  for general corporate purposes 
future financing and capital needs debt and derivative maturities one of our principal long term liquidity needs is the repayment of long term debt at the time that such debt matures 
for unsecured notes  a portion of the principal of these notes may be repaid prior to maturity 
early retirement of our unsecured notes could result in gains or losses on extinguishment 
if we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due  it will be necessary for us to refinance the debt 
this refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings  additional debt financing that is secured by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities  borrowings under our credit facility or by equity offerings 
although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our currently anticipated liquidity needs  we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or  if available  that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory 
we are also party to a  forward interest rate swap agreement  which was executed to reduce the impact of variability in interest rates on a portion of our expected debt issuance activity in in  based on changes in our capital markets outlook for the year  coupled with our current liquidity position  it is now uncertain as to whether we will issue the anticipated debt for which this interest rate protection agreement was transacted 
we expect to settle this position at or prior to its maturity in may for the fair value at the time of settlement 
at the point that we deem the 
table of contents anticipated debt issuance probable of not occurring  we will record a charge for the reversal of the amount recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income for the forward interest swap agreement 
if we do issue the debt as previously anticipated  then the amounts recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income will be recognized as interest expense over the term of the debt 
as of january  we had recorded a liability related to the value of this contract of in conjunction with our issuance of unsecured notes in september  discussed below  we cash settled a liability associated with a second  forward interest rate swap contract to which we were a party in september for  in addition to the proceeds received from the common equity offering we completed in december and from the cep ii and cep iii offerings during and the forward interest rate swap agreement discussed above  the following financing activity occurred during in january  we repaid  principal amount of unsecured notes pursuant to their scheduled maturity 
in february  in conjunction with the acquisition of a community  we assumed the existing mortgage note in the amount of  that matures in june  and is secured by the community 
also in february  we repaid a variable rate secured mortgage note in the amount of  in advance of its november scheduled maturity date 
in conjunction with the early retirement we incurred a non cash charge of  for the write off of deferred financing fees which was recognized as a loss on extinguishment of debt on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
in may  we repaid a variable rate secured mortgage note in the amount of  in accordance with its scheduled maturity date 
also in may  in conjunction with the disposition of an operating community  we repaid a variable rate secured mortgage note in the amount of  in advance of its scheduled maturity date 
we incurred a charge of  for a prepayment penalty and the write off of deferred financing fees associated with the early repayment of this note included in income from discontinued operations on the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
in september  we issued  principal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering under our existing shelf registration statement 
the notes mature in september and were issued at a interest rate 
the notes have an effective interest rate of approximately  including the effect of the interest rate hedge discussed above and offering costs 
in november  we repaid  principal amount of unsecured notes pursuant to their scheduled maturity 
in december  we issued  principal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering under our existing shelf registration statement 
the notes mature in march and were issued at a interest rate 
the notes have an effective interest rate of  including the effect of offering costs 
the following table details debt maturities for the next five years  excluding our credit facility and amounts outstanding related to communities classified as held for sale  for debt outstanding at december  dollars in thousands

table of contents future financing and capital needs portfolio and other activity as discussed in this form k  we have entered into a purchase agreement to acquire certain of archstone net assets 
see discussion under contractual obligations 
as of december   we had wholly owned communities under construction  for which a total estimated cost of  remained to be invested 
we also had five wholly owned communities under reconstruction  for which a total estimated cost of  remained to be invested 
substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction and fund development costs related to pursuing development rights will be funded from our  credit facility until it expires in cash currently on hand  invested in highly liquid overnight money market funds and repurchase agreements  and short term investment vehicles  retained operating cash  the net proceeds from sales of existing communities  the issuance of debt or equity securities  and or private equity funding  including joint venture activity 
before planned reconstruction activity  including reconstruction activity related to communities owned by the funds  or the construction of a development right begins  we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings  although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing 
in the event that financing cannot be obtained  we may have to abandon development rights  write off associated pre development costs that were capitalized and or forego reconstruction activity 
in such instances  we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such development rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred 
from time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets 
we generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity 
we may also use joint ventures related to mixed use land development opportunities where our partners bring specific development and operational expertise to the venture 
each joint venture or partnership agreement has been individually negotiated  and our ability to operate and or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement 
we cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures 
in evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets  we sell assets that do not meet our long term investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities 
because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets  the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income  but reduce future total revenues  total expenses and noi 
however  we believe that the absence of future cash flows from communities sold will have a minimal impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs

each mortgage loan provides that it is the obligation of the respective subsidiary only  except under exceptional circumstances such as fraud or misapplication of funds in which case the respective fund could also have obligations with respect to the mortgage loan 
in no event do the mortgage loans provide for recourse against investors in the funds  including against us or our wholly owned subsidiaries that invest in the funds 
a default by a fund or a fund subsidiary on any loan to it would not constitute a default under any of our loans or any loans of our other non fund subsidiaries or affiliates 
if a fund subsidiary or a fund were unable to meet its obligations under a loan  the value of our investment in that fund would likely decline and we might also be more likely to be obligated under the guarantee we provided to one of the fund partners in each fund as described above 
if a fund subsidiary or a fund were unable to meet its obligations under a loan  we and or the other investors might evaluate whether it was in our respective interests to voluntarily support the fund through additional equity contributions and or take other actions to avoid a default under a loan or the consequences of a default such as foreclosure of a fund asset 
in the future  in the event either of the funds were unable to meet their obligations under a loan  we cannot predict at this time whether we would provide any voluntary support  or take any other action  as any such action would depend on a variety of factors  including the amount of support required and the possibility that such support could enhance the return of either of the funds and or our returns by providing time for performance to improve

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  or different assumptions were made  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied  resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements 
below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain 
a discussion of our significant accounting policies  including further discussion of the accounting policies described below  can be found in note  organization and basis of presentation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents principles of consolidation we may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets 
we must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting 
we determine whether to consolidate certain entities based on our rights and obligations under the joint venture agreements  applying the applicable accounting guidance 
for investment interests that we do not consolidate  we evaluate the guidance to determine the accounting framework to apply 
the application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture is complex and requires substantial management judgment 
therefore  we believe the decision to choose an appropriate accounting framework is a critical accounting estimate 
if we were to consolidate the joint ventures that we accounted for using the equity method at december   our assets would have increased by  and our liabilities would have increased by  we would be required to consolidate those joint ventures currently not consolidated for financial reporting purposes if the facts and circumstances changed  including but not limited to the following reasons  none of which are currently expected to occur for entities not considered to be variable interest entities  the nature of the entity changed such that it would be considered a variable interest entity and if we were considered the primary beneficiary 
for entities in which we do not hold a controlling voting and or variable interest  the contractual arrangement changed resulting in our investment interest being either a controlling voting and or variable interest 
we evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs 
cost capitalization we capitalize costs during the development of assets beginning when we determine that development of a future asset is probable until the asset  or a portion of the asset  is delivered and is ready for its intended use 
for redevelopment efforts  we capitalize costs either i in advance of taking homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun until the redevelopment is completed  or ii when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident 
rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial lease up or post redevelopment lease up period are fully recognized as they accrue 
during the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct costs and indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities 
these costs include interest and related loan fees  property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs 
interest is capitalized for any project specific financing  as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects 
indirect project costs  which include personnel and office and administrative costs that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts  are also capitalized 
capitalized indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities are comprised primarily of compensation related costs for associates dedicated to our development and redevelopment efforts and total   and  for   and  respectively 
the estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment and  as such  we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate 

table of contents there may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to our levels of development or redevelopment activity 
if changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs  there may be an increase in our operating expenses 
for example  if in our development activities decreased by  and there were no corresponding decrease in our indirect project costs  our operating expenses would have increased by  we capitalize pre development costs incurred in pursuit of development rights 
these costs include legal fees  design fees and related overhead costs 
future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors  including zoning and regulatory approval  rental market conditions  construction costs and availability of capital 
pre development costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred 
in addition  if the status of a development right changes  making future development no longer probable  any capitalized pre development costs are written off with a charge to expense 
due to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the development of an apartment community  and therefore should be capitalized  the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate 
if we had determined that of our capitalized pursuit costs were associated with development rights that were no longer probable of occurring  net income for the year ended december  would have decreased by  abandoned pursuit costs asset impairment we evaluate our real estate and other long lived assets for impairment when potential indicators of impairment exist 
such assets are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization  unless the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable 
if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable  we assess its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the property to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
if the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows  we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property 
based on periodic tests of recoverability of long lived assets  for the years ended december   and  we did not record any impairment losses for wholly owned operating real estate assets 
we expensed costs related to abandoned pursuits  which includes the abandonment of development rights and disposition pursuits  in the amounts of  in   in and  in these costs are included in operating expenses  excluding property taxes on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income 
abandoned pursuit costs can vary greatly  and the costs incurred in any given period may be significantly different in future years 
we also assess land held for development for impairment if our intent changes with respect to the development of the land 
we did not recognize any impairment charges for land holdings in or during  we concluded that we would pursue the sale of two land parcels and  as a result  that the carrying bases of the two land parcels were not fully recoverable 
as a result  we recognized an aggregate charge of  for the impairment of these land parcels 
we had previously recognized an impairment loss of  in when we determined that we no longer intended to pursue development of the assets 
our change in intent to pursue disposition of these assets rather than holding for investment triggered the determination that a further impairment of the basis for the land parcels existed 
we looked to a combination of internal models and third party pricing estimates to determine the fair values for these impaired land parcels 
considering our knowledge of multifamily residential development  the fair values of parcels zoned for multifamily development were generated using an internal model 
land parcels zoned for other purposes were valued using third party estimates 
table of contents of fair value 
for the internally generated fair values  we used a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows for a multifamily rental community 
the cash flow analysis incorporated assumptions that market participants would make  including applying discount factors to the estimated future cash flows of the underlying asset  as well as potential disposition proceeds 
the third party values incorporated the use of estimated rates of return  investment time horizons and sales prices for land parcels considered to be market comparables  adjusted for known differences in critical areas including the existing entitlements such as zoning and state of infrastructure readiness 
both valuation methods included significant other unobservable inputs and are therefore classified as level prices in the fair value hierarchy 
we also evaluate our unconsolidated investments for impairment  considering both the carrying value of the investment  estimated to be the expected proceeds that it would receive if the entity were dissolved and the net assets were liquidated  as well as our proportionate share of any impairment of assets held by unconsolidated investments 
during  we concluded that because the market for for sale housing development had not improved as expected  the investment in an unconsolidated joint venture was impaired and that impairment was other than temporary 
as a result  we recognized a charge of  for the impairment of the investment in the unconsolidated joint venture 
there were no impairment losses recognized by any of our investments in unconsolidated entities during or our focus on value creation through real estate development presents an impairment risk in the event of a future deterioration of the real estate and or capital markets or a decision by us to reduce or cease development 
we cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed  or the likelihood of any future impairment charges  if any 
you should also review item a  risk factors of this form k 
reit status we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated  for federal income tax purposes  as a reit 
we elected to be taxed as a reit under the code for the year ended december  and have not revoked such election 
a corporate reit is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that it currently distribute at least of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income if we distribute of our taxable income to our stockholders over time periods allowed under the code 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and may not be able to elect to qualify as a reit for four subsequent taxable years 
for example  if we failed to qualify as a reit in  our net income would have decreased by approximately  our qualification as a reit requires management to exercise significant judgment and consideration with respect to operational matters and accounting treatment 
therefore  we believe our reit status is a critical accounting estimate 
acquisition of investments in real estate we account for our acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with the authoritative guidance for the initial measurement  which requires the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to be recognized at fair value 
typical assets and liabilities acquired include land  building  furniture  fixtures  and equipment  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above below market leases and in place leases 
in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price  we utilize various sources  including our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks from our financial instruments primarily from changes in market interest rates 
we do not have exposure to any other significant market risk 
we monitor interest rate risk as an integral part of our overall risk management  which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations 
our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates  primarily in short term libor and the sifma index as a result of borrowings under our credit facility and outstanding bonds with variable interest rates 
in addition  the fair value of our fixed rate unsecured and secured notes are impacted by changes in market interest rates 
the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our results of operations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results  such as rental rates and occupancy 
we currently use interest rate protection agreements consisting of interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements for our risk management objectives  as well as for compliance with the requirements of certain lenders  and not for trading or speculative purposes 
in the second quarter of  we entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the impact of future interest rate changes on our expected issuance of debt in future periods 
in addition  we have interest rate caps and interest rate swaps that serve to either convert floating rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings  or effectively limit the amount of interest rate expense we would incur on a floating rate borrowing 
further discussion of the financial instruments impacted and our exposure is presented below 
we had  and  in variable rate debt outstanding including fixed rate debt effectively swapped to variable rates through swap agreements  as of and  respectively 
if interest rates on the variable rate debt had been basis points higher throughout and  our annual interest costs would have increased by approximately  and  respectively  based on balances outstanding during the applicable years
