facilities our retail operations in the cayman islands produce potable water at four reverse osmosis seawater conversion plants in grand cayman located at our abel castillo water works acww  formerly governor s harbour  britannia and west bay sites 
we own the land for our acww and west bay plants and have entered into a lease for the land for our britannia plant until january  the current production capacity of the two plants located at acww is million gallons of water per day 
the production capacity of the britannia plant is  gallons of water per day 
the production capacity of the west bay plant is  gallons of water per day 
electricity to our plants is supplied by caribbean utilities co 
ltd  a publicly traded utility company 
at all of our four retail plant sites we maintain diesel driven  standby generators with sufficient capacity to operate our distribution pumps and other essential equipment during any temporary interruptions in electricity supply 
standby generation capacity is available at our west bay plant and acww plants to operate a portion of the water production capacity as well 
in the event of an emergency  our distribution system is connected to the distribution system of the water authority cayman 
in prior years we have purchased water from the water authority cayman for brief periods of time 
we have also sold potable water to the water authority cayman from our retail plants 
our pipeline system in the cayman islands covers the seven mile beach and west bay areas of grand cayman and consists of approximately miles of polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene pipeline 
we extend our distribution system periodically as demand warrants 
we have a main pipe loop covering the seven mile beach and west bay areas 
we place extensions of smaller diameter pipe off our main pipe to service new developments in our service area 
this system of building branches from the main pipe keeps construction costs low and allows us to provide service to new areas in a timely manner 
developers are responsible for laying the pipeline within their developments at their own cost  but in accordance with our specifications 
when a development is completed  the developer then transfers operation and maintenance of the pipeline to us 
customers we enter into contracts with hotels  condominiums  residential homes and other properties located in our existing licensed area to provide potable water 
in the seven mile beach area  our primary customers are the hotels and condominium complexes that serve the tourist industry 
in the west bay area  our primary customers are residential homes 
we bill our customers on a monthly basis based on metered consumption and bills are typically collected within to days after the billing date and receivables not collected within days subject the customer to disconnection from water service 
in  and  bad debts represented less than of our total annual retail sales 
in addition to their past due invoice balance  customers that have had their service disconnected must pay re connection charges 
historically  demand on our pipeline distribution has varied throughout the year 
demand depends upon the number of tourists visiting and the amount of rainfall during any particular time of the year 
in general  the majority of tourists come from the united states during the winter months 
prospective retail operations during the latter half of  we commenced  through our newly formed owned subsidiary  cw bali  the construction of a seawater reverse osmosis plant in nusa dua  one of the primary tourist areas of bali  indonesia 
we believe the water demands of the tourist resorts in nusa dua will soon exceed the water supplies that can be provided to the area by the local public water utility  and that other areas of bali will also eventually experience fresh water shortages 
however  as seawater reverse osmosis has not been employed to any meaningful extent in bali  we have concluded that to obtain customers in bali we must first demonstrate the viability of seawater reverse osmosis as well as our capabilities and expertise 
consequently  we have elected to commence this plant s construction before obtaining contracts for its full production 
we believe we will be able to sell of the plant s initial capacity once it becomes operational  although we cannot assure that we will be able to do so 
the initial capital investment for this plant is estimated at approximately million  which will fund the first phase of production capacity of approximately  gallons per day 
as of december  we had expended approximately million in construction costs for this phase 
this plant has been designed for expansion in subsequent phases to a total production capacity of million gallons per day should sufficient customer demand exist 
bulk water operations for fiscal years  and  our bulk water operations accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues and are comprised of businesses in the cayman islands  the bahamas and belize 
these businesses produce potable water from seawater and sell this water to governments and private customers 
bulk water operations in the cayman islands we sell bulk water in the cayman islands through our wholly owned subsidiary oc cayman 
facilities we operate and sell water to the water authority cayman wac from reverse osmosis seawater conversion plants in grand cayman that are owned by the wac three of these plants  the red gate  north sound and north side water works plants  which have production capacities of approximately million  million and million gallons of water per day  respectively  are presently operated by us 
the north side water works plant was commissioned in june the red gate plant was temporarily de commissioned in december in order to carry out extensive rehabilitative and upgrade work to the plant as part of a new seven year operating contract with the wac 
the refurbished red gate plant was re commissioned in july we also operated and sold water from the lower valley plant  which is owned by the wac and has a production capacity of million gallons per day  through the january expiration date of our operating contract for that plant 
the wac has now assumed the operations of the lower valley plant 
the plants that we operate for the wac are located on land owned by the wac 
customers we provide bulk water on a take or pay basis to the wac  a government owned utility and regulatory agency  under various licenses and agreements 
the wac in turn distributes that water to properties in the parts of grand cayman that are outside of our retail license area

the base price of water supplied  and adjustments thereto  are determined by the terms of the contract  which provides for annual adjustments based upon the movement in the government price indices specified in the contract  as well as monthly adjustments for changes in the cost of diesel fuel and electricity 
demand is less cyclical than in our other locations due to a higher proportion of residential to tourist demand 
we have an exclusive year contract with bwsl to supply a minimum of million gallons of water per week  or upon demand up to million gallons per week  on a take or pay basis 
this contract expires on march  bwsl has the right  with six months advance notice before the expiration date  to renew the contract for a further year period on the same terms and conditions

reverse osmosis technology the conversion of seawater to potable water is called desalination 
the two primary forms of desalination are distillation and reverse osmosis 
both methods are used throughout the world and technologies are improving to lower the costs of production 
reverse osmosis is a fluid separation process in which the saline water is pressurized and the fresh water is separated from the saline water by passing through a semi permeable membrane which rejects the salts 
the saline water ie seawater is first passed through a pretreatment system  which generally consists of fine filtration and treatment chemicals  if required 
pre treatment removes suspended solids and organics which could cause fouling of the membrane surface 
next  a high pressure pump pressurizes the saline water thus enabling approximately conversion of the saline water to fresh water as it passes through the membrane  while more than of the dissolved salts are rejected and remain in the now concentrated saline water 
this remaining feed water which has now been concentrated is discharged without passing through the membrane 
the remaining hydraulic energy in the concentrated feed water is transferred to the initial saline feed water with an energy recovery device thus reducing the total energy requirement for the reverse osmosis system 
the final step is post treatment  which consists of stabilizing the produced fresh water thereby removing undesirable dissolved gases  adjusting the ph and providing chlorination to prepare it for distribution 
we currently use reverse osmosis technology to convert seawater to potable water at all of the plants we construct and operate 
we believe that this technology is the most effective and efficient conversion process for our market 
however  we are always seeking ways to maximize efficiencies in our current processes and investigating new  more efficient processes to convert seawater to potable water 
the equipment at our plants is among the most energy efficient available and we monitor and maintain the equipment in an efficient manner 
as a result of our decades of experience in seawater desalination  we believe that we have the expertise and know how in the development and operation of desalination plants that is easily transferable to locations outside of our current operating areas 
raw materials and sources of supply all materials  parts and supplies essential to our business operations are obtained from multiple sources and we use the latest industry technology 
we do not manufacture any parts or components for equipment essential to our business 
our access to seawater for processing into potable water is granted through our licenses and contracts with governments of the various jurisdictions in which we have our operations 
seasonal variations in our business our operations are affected by the levels of tourism and are subject to seasonal variations in our service areas 
demand for our water in the cayman islands  belize  and the bahamas is affected by variations in the level of tourism and local weather  primarily rainfall 
tourism in our service areas is affected by the economies of the tourists home countries  primarily the united states and europe  terrorist activity and perceived threats thereof  and increased costs of fuel and airfares 
we normally sell more water during the first and second quarters  when the number of tourists is greater and local rainfall is less  than in the third and fourth quarters 
government regulations  custom duties and taxes our operations and activities are subject to the governmental regulations and taxes of the countries in which we operate 
the following summary of regulatory developments and legislation does not purport to describe all present and proposed regulation and legislation that may affect our businesses 
legislative or regulatory requirements currently applicable to our businesses may change in the future 
any such changes could impose new obligations on us that may adversely affect our businesses and operating results

market and service area although we currently operate in the cayman islands  belize  the british virgin islands  and the bahamas  we believe that our potential market consists of any location where there is a need for potable water 
the desalination of seawater  either through distillation or reverse osmosis  is the most widely used process for producing potable water in areas with an insufficient natural supply 
we believe our experience in the development and operation of reverse osmosis desalination plants provides us with a significant opportunity to successfully expand our operations beyond the markets in which we currently operate 
cayman islands 
the cayman islands government  through the water authority cayman  supplies water to parts of grand cayman  which are not within our licensed area  as well as to cayman brac 
we operate all but one of the reverse osmosis desalination plants owned by the water authority cayman on grand cayman and supply water under licenses and supply agreements held by oc cayman with the water authority cayman 
according to the most recent information published by the economics and statistics office of the cayman islands government  the population of the cayman islands was estimated in december to be approximately  according to the figures published by the department of tourism statistics information center  during the year ended december   tourist air arrivals increased by and tourist cruise ship arrivals increased by compared to total visitors for the year increased from million in to million in we believe that our water sales in the cayman islands are more positively impacted by stay over tourists that arrive by air than by those arriving by cruise ship  since cruise ship tourists generally only visit the island for one day or less and do not remain on the island overnight 
belize 
our current operations in belize are located on ambergris caye  which consists of residential  commercial and tourist properties in the town of san pedro 
this town is located on the southern end of ambergris caye  one of many islands located east of the belize mainland and off the southeastern tip of the yucatan peninsula 
ambergris caye is approximately miles long and  according to the central statistical office belize national census overview  has a population of about  residents 
we provide bulk potable water to bwsl  which distributes this water to this market 
bwsl currently has no other source of potable water on ambergris caye 
our contract with bwsl makes us their exclusive producer of desalinated water on ambergris caye through a mile long barrier reef  which is the largest barrier reef in the western hemisphere  is situated just offshore of ambergris caye 
this natural attraction is a choice destination for scuba divers and tourists 
according to information published by the belize trade and investment development service  tourism is belize s second largest source of foreign income  next to agriculture

competition cayman islands 
pursuant to our license granted by the cayman islands government  we have the exclusive right to provide potable  piped water within our licensed service area on grand cayman 
at the present time  we are the only non government owned public water utility on grand cayman 
the cayman islands government  through the water authority cayman  supplies water to parts of grand cayman located outside of our licensed service area 
although we have no competition within our exclusive retail license service area  our ability to expand our service area is at the discretion of the cayman island government 
private residences and commercial multi unit dwellings up to four units may install water making equipment for their own use 
water plants on premises within our license area and serving only their premises in existence prior to can be maintained but not replaced or expanded 
we are aware of only one such plant currently in operation 
the cayman islands government  through the water authority cayman  supplies water to parts of grand cayman outside of our licensed service area 
we have competed with such companies as ge water  veolia  and ide for bulk water supply contracts with the water authority cayman 
belize 
on ambergris caye in belize  our water supply contract with belize water services limited is exclusive  and belize water services limited can no longer seek contracts with other water suppliers  or produce water themselves  to meet their future needs in san pedro  ambergris caye  belize 
the bahamas 
on south bimini island in the bahamas  we supply water to a private developer and do not have competitors 
ge water operates a seawater desalination plant on north bimini island and other small islands 
we competed with companies such as ge water  veolia  ide  ohl inima and biwater for the new contract with the bahamian government to build and operate a seawater desalination plant at blue hills  new providence  bahamas 
we expect to compete with these companies and others for future water supply contracts in the bahamas 
british virgin islands 
in the british virgin islands  ge water operates seawater desalination plants in west end and sea cows bay  tortola  and on virgin gorda and generally bids against oc bvi for projects 
in  biwater plc was awarded a year contract to construct and operate a million gallon per day desalination plant in tortola for the british virgin islands government which has not yet commenced operations 
to implement our growth strategy outside our existing operating areas  we will have to compete with some of the same companies we competed with for the blue hills project in nassau  bahamas such as ge water  veolia  ide technologies  ohl inima  and biwater as well as other smaller companies 
some of these companies currently operate in areas in which we would like to expand our operations and already maintain worldwide operations having greater financial  managerial and other resources than our company 
we believe that our low overhead costs  knowledge of local markets and conditions and our efficient manner of operating desalinated water production and distribution equipment provide us with the capabilities to effectively compete for new projects in the caribbean basin and other select markets

our exclusive license to provide water to retail customers in the cayman islands may not be renewed in the future 
in the cayman islands  we provide water to retail customers under a license issued to us in july by the cayman islands government that grants us the exclusive right to provide water to retail customers within our licensed service area 
our service area is comprised of an area on grand cayman that includes the seven mile beach and west bay areas  two of the three most populated areas in the cayman islands 
for the year ended december   we generated approximately of our consolidated revenues and of our consolidated gross profits from the retail water operations conducted pursuant to our exclusive license 
if we are not in default of any terms of the license  we have a right of first refusal to renew the license on terms that are no less favorable than those that the government offers to any third party 
this license was set to expire on july   however  we and the cayman islands government have extended the license several times in order to provide sufficient time to negotiate the terms of a new license agreement 
the most recent extension of our license expires march  in february  the water production and supply law  which replaces the water production and supply law revision under which the company is licensed and the water authority amendment law  the new laws were published and are now in full force and effect 
under the new laws  the water authority cayman wac would issue any new license which could include a rate of return on invested capital model described below 
we have been advised in correspondence from the cayman islands government and the wac that i the wac is now the principal negotiator  and not the cayman islands government  in these license negotiations  and ii the wac has determined that a rate of return on invested capital model rcam is in the best interest of the public and the company s customers 
rcam is the rate model currently utilized in the electricity transmission and distribution license granted by the cayman islands government to the caribbean utilities company  ltd 
in july  in an effort to resolve several issues relating to our retail license renewal negotiations  we filed an application for leave to apply for judicial review the application with the grand court of the cayman islands the court  stating that i certain provisions of the water authority law  and the water production and supply law   appear to be incompatible  ii the wac s roles as the principal license negotiator  statutory regulator and our competitor put the wac in a position of hopeless conflict  and iii the wac s decision to replace the rate structure under our current exclusive license with rcam was predetermined and unreasonable 
throughout the course of the retail license renewal negotiations  we have objected to the use of rcam on the basis that we believe such a model would not promote the efficient operation of our water utility and could ultimately increase water rates to our customers 
in october  we were notified that the court agreed to consider the issues raised in the application 
as a result  our company  the cayman islands government and the wac will have the opportunity to present their positions to the court in a trial proceeding 
if we do not ultimately enter into a new license agreement and no other party is awarded a license  we expect to be permitted to continue to supply water to our service area 
the cayman islands government could offer a third party a license to service some or all of our present service area 
in such event  we may assume the license offered to the third party by exercising our right of first refusal 
however  the terms of any new license agreement may not be as favorable to us as the terms under which we are presently operating and could materially reduce the operating income and cash flows that we have historically generated from our retail license and could require us to record an impairment loss to further reduce the  carrying value of our goodwill 
such impairment loss could be material to our results of operations 
we rely on fixed term water supply agreements with our bulk customers in the cayman islands  belize and the bahamas  which may not be renewed or may be renewed on terms less favorable to us 
all of our bulk water supply agreements are for fixed terms ranging originally from seven to years and with a range of less than one to years remaining 
upon expiration  these agreements may not be renewed or may be renewed on terms less favorable to us 
in addition  certain of these agreements for plants not owned by us provide for our customers to take over the operations of the plant upon expiration of the contract term 
if this occurs  we may no longer generate income from such plants 
in instances where we own the plant that produces the water under an agreement that is not renewed or renewed with lower production quantities  we may not be able to find a new customer for the plant s excess production capacity 
if our fixed term agreements are not renewed or are renewed on terms less favorable to us  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we have spent almost million to fund the development costs for a possible project in mexico and expect to expend significant additional funds in and to continue to pursue this project 
however  we may not be successful in completing this project 
in may  we acquired  through our wholly owned netherlands subsidiary  consolidated water cooperatief  ua  a interest in nsc agua  nsc de nsc  nsc a mexican company  and have since acquired the voting rights for  and an option to purchase  an additional interest in this company 
nsc has been formed to pursue a project encompassing the construction  ownership and operation of a million gallon per day seawater reverse osmosis desalination plant to be located in northern baja california  mexico and an accompanying pipeline to deliver water to a mexican potable water system and the us border 
we believe such a project can be successful due to what we anticipate will be a growing need for a new potable water supply for the areas of northern baja california  mexico and southern california  united states 
to complete this project  we have engaged two engineering groups with extensive regional and or technical experience and have partnered with doosan heavy industries and construction dhic  a global leader in the engineering  procurement and construction of large seawater desalination plants 
once completed  one of our subsidiaries would operate the plant and we would retain a minority position in its ownership 
nsc is in the development stage  and is presently involved in i purchasing additional land on which to build the plant  ii seeking contracts for the electric power and feed water sources for the plant s proposed operations  and iii conducting under a memorandum of understanding with dhic an equipment piloting plant and water quality data collection program at the proposed feed water source 
in addition to completing these activities  nsc will be required to complete various other steps before it can commence construction of the plant and pipeline including  but not limited to  obtaining approvals and permits from various governmental agencies in mexico and the united states  securing contracts with its proposed customers to sell water in sufficient quantities and at prices that make the project financially viable  and obtaining equity and debt financing for the project 
nsc s potential customers will also be required to obtain various governmental permits and approvals in order to purchase water from nsc 
for our interest in nsc  we provided the initial funding of million in the form of equity for nsc s development activities and have also provided all subsequent funding for nsc 
because we exercise effective financial control over nsc and our partners in nsc have not participated in nsc s funding  we consolidate nsc s results of operations 
included in our consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and are approximately million  million and million  respectively  in general and administrative expenses from nsc  consisting of organizational  legal  accounting  engineering  consulting and other costs relating to its project development activities 
the assets and liabilities of nsc included in our consolidated balance sheet amounted to approximately  and  respectively  as of december  and approximately  and  respectively  as of december  in february  we acquired an option  exercisable through february   to purchase the shares of one of the other shareholders of nsc along with an immediate power of attorney to vote those shares 
as a result  we now have effective control of nsc 
in july  nsc obtained an extension of the purchase contract for a portion of the land on which the proposed plant would be constructed 
in exchange for additional prepayments of i  paid at signing of the extension and ii a further  payable on may   nsc was granted an extension of the purchase agreement until may  nsc is currently negotiating a purchase agreement for an additional parcel of land 
in august  nsc and dhic extended their memorandum of understanding for months from august   pursuant to which dhic provided and installed and is operating an equipment piloting plant and collecting water quality data from the proposed feed water source site in rosarito beach  baja california  mexico 
this amended memorandum of understanding requires that nsc negotiate exclusively with dhic for the construction of the million gallon per day seawater reverse osmosis desalination plant and further requires payment by nsc to dhic of up to  as compensation for the operation and maintenance of the equipment piloting plant should nsc not award the engineering  procurement and construction contract for the project to dhic 
we estimate that it will take at least through the second quarter of for nsc to complete all of the development activities which include completing the site piloting plant activities  purchasing the land for the plant  securing feed water and power supplies  completing the engineering and feasibility studies  negotiating customer contracts  obtaining required regulatory permits and arranging the project financing necessary to commence construction of the plant 
during  we expect to incur an additional million in expenses for these project development activities and to pay an additional million in deposits for the parcels of land for the project 
we expect to incur additional development expenses for this project in however  nsc may ultimately be unable to complete all of the activities necessary to begin construction of the project 
we do not have voting control over our affiliate  oc bvi 
should our interests and the interests of oc bvi s other voting shareholder diverge  the operations of oc bvi could be adversely affected which could decrease the value of our investment in oc bvi 
we own of the equity and of the voting shares of oc bvi 
we and sage  which owns the remaining of the voting shares  are each entitled to appoint three of the six directors of oc bvi 
if a tie vote of the directors occurs on any matter  the president of the caribbean water and wastewater association  a regional trade association comprised primarily of government representatives  is entitled to appoint a temporary director to cast the deciding vote 
as a result  although we provide operating management and engineering services to oc bvi  we share the overall management of oc bvi with sage and do not fully control its operations 
a divergence of our interests and the interests of sage could adversely affect the operations of oc bvi and in turn decrease the value of our investment in oc bvi  in which case we could be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of our investment in oc bvi 
such an impairment charge would reduce our earnings and could have a significant adverse impact on our result of operations and financial condition 
the profitability of our plants is dependent upon our ability to accurately estimate the costs of their construction and operation 
the cost estimates we prepare in connection with the construction and operation of our plants are subject to inherent uncertainties 
additionally  the terms of our supply contracts may require us to guarantee the price of water on a per unit basis  subject to certain annual inflation and monthly energy cost adjustments  and to assume the risk that the costs associated with producing this water may be greater than anticipated 
because we base our contracted price of water in part on our estimation of future construction and operating costs  the profitability of our plants is dependent on our ability to estimate these costs accurately 
the cost of materials and services and the cost of the delivery of such services may increase significantly after we submit our bid for a plant  which could cause the gross profit and net return on investment for a plant to be less than we anticipated when the bid was made 
the profit margins we initially expect to generate from a plant could be further reduced if future operating costs for that plant exceed our estimates of such costs 
these future operating costs could be affected by a variety of factors  including lower than anticipated production efficiencies and hydrological conditions at the plant site that differ materially from those we believe would exist at the time we submitted our bid 
any construction and operating costs for our plants that significantly exceed our initial estimates could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we could be required to record an impairment charge to further reduce the carrying value of our goodwill should we experience further weakness in the market price of our common shares 
at times during the past two years the carrying value of our stockholders equity has exceeded our market capitalization 
a decline in the market price of a company s common stock below its book value is one indication under us generally accepted accounting principles that the carrying value of a company s goodwill may exceed its implied fair value 
we recorded an impairment charge of  against our goodwill for the year ended december  our remaining goodwill amounted to  as of december  should the market price of our common stock decline significantly in the future or should our common stock continue to trade at market prices lower than its book value  we may be required to record additional impairment charges for a portion or all of this goodwill 
such impairment charges could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
a significant portion of our consolidated revenues are derived from two customers 
a loss of  or a less favorable relationship with  either of these customers could adversely affect us 
our top two bulk water customers  the water authority cayman and the water and sewerage corporation of the bahamas  accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december  if either of these customers terminate or decide not to renew their contracts with us  or renew such contracts on terms that are less favorable to us  or become unable for financial or other reasons to comply with the terms of our contracts with them  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected

possible future regulatory oversight and control could adversely impact our belize operations 
by statutory instrument no 
of  the minister of public utilities of the government of belize published an order  the public utility provider class declaration order  the order  which as of may  designated cw belize as a public utility provider under the laws of belize 
with this designation  the public utilities commission of belize the puc has the authority to set the rates charged by cw belize and to otherwise regulate its activities 
on november   cw belize received a formal complaint from the puc alleging that cw belize was operating without a license under the terms of the water industry act 
cw belize applied for this license in december on july   the puc issued the san pedro public water supply quality and security complaint order the second order which among other things requires that i cw belize and its customer jointly make a submission to the responsible minister requesting that the area surrounding cw belize s seawater abstraction wells be designated a forest reserve or national park and be designated a controlled area under section of the water industry act  ii cw belize submit an operations manual for cw belize s desalination plant to the puc for approval  iii cw belize and its customer modify the water supply agreement between the parties to a include new water quality parameters included in the order and b cap the current exclusive water supply arrangement in the agreement at a maximum of  gallons per day  iv cw belize keep a minimum number of replacement seawater ro membranes in stock at all times and v cw belize take possession of and reimburse the puc for certain equipment which the puc purchased from a third party in late cw belize has applied for declaratory judgment and has been granted a temporary injunction to stay the enforcement of the second order by the puc until such time as the matter could be heard by the belize courts 
the initial hearing on this matter was conducted on october and  with an additional hearing on november  the ruling on this case is pending 
an unfavorable ruling on the order or the second order could have an adverse impact on our results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
our operations are affected by tourism and are subject to seasonal fluctuations which could affect the demand for our water 
our operations are affected by the levels of tourism and are subject to seasonal variations in our service areas 
demand for our water in the cayman islands  belize  bimini and the bahamas is affected by variations in the level of tourism and local weather  primarily rainfall 
tourism in our service areas is affected by the economies of the tourists home countries  primarily the united states and europe  terrorist activity and perceived threats thereof  and increased costs of fuel and airfares 
we normally sell more water during the first and second quarters  when the number of tourists is greater and local rainfall is less  than in the third and fourth quarters 
a downturn in tourism or greater than expected rainfall in the locations we serve could adversely affect our revenues  cash flows and results of operations 
we may have difficulty accomplishing our growth strategy within and outside of our current operating areas 
our expansion both within our current operating areas and into new areas involves significant risks  including  but not limited to  the following regulatory risks  including government relations difficulties  local regulations  currency controls and fluctuations in currency exchange rates  receiving and maintaining necessary permits  licenses and approvals  political instability  reliance on local economies  environmental problems  shortages of materials  immigration restrictions and limited skilled labor  risks related to development of new operations  including inaccurate assessment of the demand for water  engineering difficulties and inability to begin operations as scheduled  and risks relating to greater competition in these new territories  including the ability of our competitors to gain or retain market share by reducing prices 
even if we successfully expand our operations  we may have difficulty managing our growth 
we cannot assure you that any new operations within or outside of our current operating areas will attain or maintain profitability or that the results from these new operations will not adversely impact our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
production shortfalls under any of our bulk supply contracts could result in penalties or cancellation of the contract 
our bulk water supply contracts require us to deliver specified minimum volumes of water 
membrane fouling or other technical problems could occur at any of our plants  and if we are unable to meet the production minimums due to such operating issues  we could be in technical default of the supply contract and subject to various adverse consequences  including financial penalties or cancellation of the contract 
our operations could be harmed by hurricanes or tropical storms 
a hurricane or tropical storm could cause major damage to our equipment and properties and the properties of our customers  including the large tourist properties in our areas of operation 
for example  in september hurricane ivan caused significant damage to our plants and our customers properties  which adversely affected our revenues 
any future damage could cause us to lose use of our equipment and properties and incur additional repair costs 
damage to our customers properties and the adverse impact on tourism could result in a decrease in water demand 
a hurricane or tropical storm could also disrupt the delivery of equipment and supplies  including electricity  necessary to our operations 
these and other possible effects of hurricanes or tropical storms could have an adverse impact on our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
contamination of our processed water may cause disruption in our services and adversely affect our revenues 
our processed water may become contaminated by natural occurrences and by inadvertent or intentional human interference  including acts of terrorism 
in the event that a portion of our processed water is contaminated  we may have to interrupt the supply of water until we are able to install treatment equipment or substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water production source 
in addition  we may incur significant costs in order to treat a contaminated source of plant feed water through expansion of our current treatment facilities  or development of new treatment methods 
an inability by us to substitute processed water from an uncontaminated water source or to adequately treat the contaminated plant feed water in a cost effective manner may have an adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
potential government decisions  actions and regulations could negatively affect our operations 
we are subject to the local regulations of the cayman islands  belize  the british virgin islands  and the bahamas  all of which are subject to change 
any government that regulates our operations may issue legislation or adopt new regulations  including but not limited to restricting foreign ownership by us  providing for the expropriation of our assets by the government  providing for nationalization of public utilities by the government  providing for different water quality standards  unilaterally changing or renegotiating our licenses and agreements  restricting the transfer of us currency  or causing currency exchange fluctuations devaluations or making changes in tax laws 
as new laws and regulations are issued  we may be required to modify our operations and business strategy  which we may be unable to do in a cost effective manner 
failure by us to comply with applicable regulations could result in the loss of our licenses or authorizations to operate  the assessment of penalties or fines  or otherwise may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the rates we charge our retail customers in the cayman islands are subject to regulation 
if we are unable to obtain government approval of our requests for rate increases  or if approved rate increases are untimely or inadequate to cover our projected expenses  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
under our exclusive retail license in the cayman islands  with the exception of annual inflation related and monthly energy related adjustments  we cannot increase the base rates we charge our retail customers without prior approval from the cayman islands government 
however  the expenses we incur in supplying water under this license may increase due to circumstances that were unforeseen at the time we entered into the license 
we may incur additional costs in attempting to obtain government approval of any rate increase  which may be granted on a delayed basis  if at all 
failure to obtain timely and adequate rate increases could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
we rely on the efforts of key employees 
our failure to retain these employees could adversely affect our results of operations 
our success depends upon the abilities of our executive officers 
in particular  the loss of the services of fredrick w 
mctaggart  our president and chief executive officer  could be detrimental to our operations and our continued success 
mr 
mctaggart has an employment agreement expiring on december  each year  the term of this agreement may be extended for an additional year 
however  we cannot guarantee that mr 
mctaggart will continue to work for us during the term of his agreement or will enter into any extensions thereof 
we are exposed to credit risk through our relationships with several customers 
we are subject to credit risk posed by possible defaults in payment by our bulk water customers in the cayman islands  belize  the british virgin islands and the bahamas and by possible defaults in payment by the water authority cayman on their loans payable to us 
adverse economic conditions affecting  or financial difficulties of  those parties could impair their ability to pay us or cause them to delay payment 
we depend on these parties to pay us on a timely basis 
our outstanding accounts receivable are not covered by collateral or credit insurance 
any delay or default in payment could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows  and financial condition 
we are exposed to the risk of variations in currency exchange rates 
although we report our results in united states dollars  the majority of our revenues are earned in other currencies 
although many of these of the currencies have been fixed to the united states dollar for more than years others the mexico peso  indonesian rupiah and the euro are not 
we do not employ hedging strategies against the foreign current exchange rate risk associated with conducting business in foreign currencies while reporting in united states dollars 
if any of the fixed exchange rates becomes a floating exchange rate  or the other currencies in which we conduct business depreciate significantly against the united state dollar  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we may enter new markets in the future in which we do not have a contractual commitment for our products or existing customers 
our strategy contemplates potential entry into new markets such as mexico  indonesia and other countries where we believe a demand for potable water exists beyond the current supply of potable water in those markets 
we may incur significant business development expenses in the pursuit of new markets prior to obtaining a contract for services in these markets  and such expenses could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
we may decide to enter such markets by building new reverse osmosis desalination plants before we have obtained a contract for the sale of water produced by the new plant or before we have established a customer base for the water produced by the new plant 
if after completing such plant we are unable to obtain a contract or sufficient number of customers for the plant  we may be unable to recover the cost of our investment in the plant  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
we may not pay dividends in the future 
if dividends are paid  they may be in lesser amounts than past dividends 
our shareholders may receive dividends out of legally available funds if  and when  they are declared by our board of directors 
we have paid dividends in the past  but may cease to do so at any time 
we may incur increased operating or development expenses or capital requirements or additional indebtedness in the future that may restrict our ability to declare and pay dividends 
we may also be restricted from paying dividends in the future due to restrictions imposed by applicable corporate laws  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition  covenants contained in our financing agreements  and other factors considered by our board of directors 
we may not continue to pay dividends in the future or  if dividends are paid  they may not be in amounts similar to past dividends 
service of process and enforcement of legal proceedings commenced against us in the united states may be difficult to obtain 
we are incorporated under the laws of the cayman islands and most of our assets are located outside of the united states 
in addition  of our directors and executive officers reside outside the united states 
as a result  it may be difficult for investors to affect service of process within the united states upon us and such other persons  or to enforce judgments obtained against such persons in united states courts  and bring any action  including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the united states securities laws 
in addition  it may be difficult for investors to enforce  in original actions brought in courts or jurisdictions located outside of the united states  rights predicated upon the united states securities laws 
based on the advice of our cayman islands legal counsel  we believe there is no reciprocal statutory enforcement of foreign judgments between the united states and the cayman islands  and that foreign judgments originating from the united states are not directly enforceable in the cayman islands 
a prevailing party in a united states proceeding against us or our officers or directors would have to initiate a new proceeding in the cayman islands using the united states judgment as evidence of the party s claim 
a prevailing party could rely on the summary judgment procedures available in the cayman islands  subject to available defenses in the cayman islands courts  including  but not limited to  the lack of competent jurisdiction in the united states courts  lack of due service of process in the united states proceeding and the possibility that enforcement or recognition of the united states judgment would be contrary to the public policy of the cayman islands 
depending on the nature of damages awarded  civil liabilities under the securities act of  as amended or the securities act  or the securities exchange act of  as amended or the exchange act  for original actions instituted outside the cayman islands may or may not be enforceable 
for example  a united states judgment awarding remedies unobtainable in any legal action in the courts of the cayman islands  such as treble damages  would likely not be enforceable under any circumstances 
low trading volume of our stock may limit your ability to sell your shares at or above the price you pay for them 
during the year ended december   the average daily trading volume of our common shares was approximately  shares  a much lower trading volume than the stock of many other companies listed on the nasdaq global select market 
a public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth  liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the market of willing buyers and sellers of our common shares at any given time 
this presence in turn depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control 
as a consequence of the limited volume of trading in our common shares  an investor in our stock may have difficulty selling a large number of our common shares in the manner or at the price that might be attainable if our common shares were more actively traded 
in addition  as a result of our low trading volume  the market price of our common shares may not accurately reflect their value 
we are subject to anti takeover measures that may discourage  delay or prevent a change of control of our company 
classified board of directors 
we have a classified board of directors that consists of three groups 
only one group of directors is elected each year 
our classified board may increase the length of time necessary for an acquirer to change the composition of a majority of directors in order to gain control of our board 
option deed 
our board of directors has adopted an option deed that is intended to improve the bargaining position of our board of directors in the event of an unsolicited offer to acquire our outstanding stock 
under the terms of the option deed  a stock purchase right is attached to each of our current or future outstanding common shares issued prior to the time the purchase rights become exercisable  are redeemed or expire 
the purchase rights will become exercisable only if an individual or group has acquired  or obtained the right to acquire  or announced a tender or exchange offer that if consummated would result in such individual or group acquiring beneficial ownership of or more of our outstanding common shares 
upon the occurrence of a triggering event  the rights will entitle every holder of our common shares  other than the acquirer  to purchase our shares or shares of our successor on terms that would likely be economically dilutive to the acquirer 
under certain circumstances  instead of common shares  our board of directors may issue cash or debt securities 
our board of directors  however  has the power to amend the option deed so that it does not apply to a particular acquisition proposal or to redeem the rights for a nominal value before they become exercisable 
these features will likely encourage an acquirer to negotiate with our board of directors before commencing a tender offer or to condition a tender offer on our board of directors taking action to prevent the purchase rights from becoming exercisable 
in march  our board extended the expiration date of the option deed through july as a result of these anti takeover measures  we could deter efforts to make changes to  or exercise control over  current management 
in addition  our shareholders may not have an opportunity to sell their common shares to a potential acquirer at the acquirer s offering price  which is typically at a premium to market price 
restrictive covenants in our credit facilities and trust deeds could adversely affect our business by limiting our flexibility  our failure to comply with these covenants could cause foreclosure on our assets 
our credit facilities and the trust deeds governing the terms of our debt securities contain restrictive covenants 
these covenants and requirements limit our ability  without approval of the lender or trustee  to take various actions  including incurring additional debt  making capital expenditures  guaranteeing indebtedness  engaging in various types of transactions  including mergers and sales of assets  and paying dividends and making distributions or other restricted payments 
these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors which may not be required to operate under these or similar restrictions 
further  these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing  acquisition or investment opportunities 
a material breach of any of these covenants would constitute a default under our credit facilities or trust deeds 
in the event of default  the lender or trustee may accelerate repayment of our outstanding indebtedness 
if we are unable to repay the amounts accelerated  the lender or trustee has the right to foreclose on substantially all of our assets  which we have pledged to secure that indebtedness 
foreclosure upon our assets would have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows  financial condition and ability to continue operations

of  the minister of public utilities of the government of belize published an order  the public utility provider class declaration order  the order  which as of may  designated cw belize as a public utility provider under the laws of belize 
with this designation  the public utilities commission of belize the puc has the authority to set the rates charged by cw belize and to otherwise regulate its activities 
on november   cw belize received a formal complaint from the puc alleging that cw belize was operating without a license under the terms of the water industry act 
cw belize applied for this license in december on july   the puc issued the san pedro public water supply quality and security complaint order the second order which among other things requires that i cw belize and its customer jointly make a submission to the responsible minister requesting that the area surrounding cw belize s seawater abstraction wells be designated a forest reserve or national park and be designated a controlled area under section of the water industry act  ii cw belize submit an operations manual for cw belize s desalination plant to the puc for approval  iii cw belize and its customer modify the water supply agreement between the parties to a include new water quality parameters included in the order and b cap the current exclusive water supply arrangement in the agreement at a maximum of  gallons per day  iv cw belize keep a minimum number of replacement seawater ro membranes in stock at all times and v cw belize take possession of and reimburse the puc for certain equipment which the puc purchased from a third party in late cw belize has applied for declaratory judgment and has been granted a temporary injunction to stay the enforcement of the second order by the puc until such time as the matter could be heard by the belize courts 
the initial hearing on this matter was conducted on october and  with an additional hearing on november  the ruling on this case is pending 
we are presently unable to determine what impact the order and the second order will have on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in july  in an effort to resolve several issues relating to our retail license renewal negotiations  we filed an application for leave to apply for judicial review the application with the grand court of the cayman islands the court  stating that i certain provisions of the water authority law  and the water production and supply law   appear to be incompatible  ii the water authority cayman s roles as the principal license negotiator  statutory regulator and our competitor put the wac in a position of hopeless conflict  and iii the wac s decision to replace the rate structure under our current exclusive license with rcam was predetermined and unreasonable 
throughout the course of the retail license renewal negotiations  we have objected to the use of rcam on the basis that we believe such a model would not promote the efficient operation of our water utility and could ultimately increase water rates to our customers 
in october  we were notified that the court agreed to consider the issues raised in the application 
as a result  our company  the cayman islands government and the wac will have the opportunity to present their positions to the court in a trial proceeding

we intend to increase revenues by developing new business opportunities both within our current service areas and in new areas 
we expect to maintain operating efficiencies by continuing to focus on our successful business model and by properly executing our equipment maintenance and water loss mitigation programs 
we believe that many water scarce countries in the caribbean basin  and other select markets present opportunities for our business model 
our operations and activities  and those of our affiliate oc bvi  are presently conducted at plants in four countries the cayman islands  the bahamas  belize and the british virgin islands

operated one plant in bermuda through the expiration of the agreement on june  cayman islands we have been operating our business on grand cayman island since and have been using reverse osmosis technology to convert seawater to potable water since the cayman islands have a limited natural supply of fresh water 
we currently have an exclusive license from the cayman islands government to process potable water from seawater and then sell and distribute that water by pipeline to seven mile beach and west bay  grand cayman 
our operations consist of eight reverse osmosis seawater conversion plants which provide water to approximately  retail residential and commercial customers within a government licensed area and bulk water sales to the water authority cayman wac 
our pipeline system in the cayman islands covers the seven mile beach and west bay areas of grand cayman and consists of approximately miles of polyvinyl chloride and high density polyethylene pipe 
our exclusive license from the cayman islands government was set to expire on july   however we and the cayman islands government have extended the license several times in order to provide sufficient time to negotiate the terms of a new license 
the most recent extension of our license expires march  in the cayman islands government enacted new water regulation laws pursuant to which the wac will issue any new retail license 
we have been informed during our retail license negotiations that the cayman islands government seeks to restructure the terms of our license to employ a rate of return on invested capital model  the implementation of which could significantly reduce the operating income and cash flows we have historically generated from our retail license

bahamas cw bahamas produces potable water from three reverse osmosis seawater conversion plants 
two of these plants  the windsor plant and the blue hills plant  are located in new providence and have a total installed capacity of million gallons per day 
cw bahamas supplies water from these plants on a take or pay basis to the water and sewerage corporation of the bahamas wsc under long term build  own and operate supply agreements 
during  we supplied approximately billion gallons billion gallons of water to the wsc from these plants 
the windsor water supply agreement expires the later of march or the date we deliver the total amount of water required under the agreement 
we estimate we will deliver this total amount in may cw bahamas third plant is located in bimini  has a capacity of  gallons per day  and provides potable water to the bimini sands resort and to the bimini beach hotel 
we have also sold water intermittently to the wsc from our bimini plant when their regular supply was unavailable 
from time to time  cw bahamas has experienced delays in collecting its accounts receivable due to financial difficulties experienced by the wsc 
cw bahamas was due approximately million from the wsc as of december  representatives of the bahamas government have informed us that the delay in paying our accounts receivables is due to operating issues within the wsc  that the delay does not reflect any type of dispute with us with respect to the amounts owed  and that the amounts will ultimately be paid in full 
we believe that the accounts receivable from the wsc are fully collectible and therefore have not provided any allowance for possible non payment of these receivables as of december  belize cw belize was acquired on july   and consists of one reverse osmosis seawater conversion plant on ambergris caye  belize  central america capable of producing  gallons per day 
we sell water to one customer  belize water services limited  which then distributes the water through its own distribution system to residential  commercial and tourist properties on ambergris caye 
in  the minister of public utilities of the government of belize published a declaratory order designating cw belize as a public utility provider 
with this order the public utilities commission of belize puc has the authority to regulate cw belize s activities 
in  the puc issued a second order that requires cw belize to take various actions mandated by the puc that would be significant to its operations 
hearings on this matter have been conducted in a belize court and the ruling on the matter is pending

risk factors 
bermuda in january  our affiliate  consolidated water bermuda limited cw bermuda entered into a design  build  sale and operating agreement with the government of bermuda for a desalination plant to be built in two phases at tynes bay along the northern coast of bermuda 
under the agreement  cw bermuda constructed and operated the plant from the second quarter of through the expiration of the agreement on june  we entered into a management services agreement with cw bermuda for the design  construction and operation of the tynes bay plant  under which we received fees for direct services  purchasing activities and proprietary technology 
although we own only of the common shares of cw bermuda  we consolidate its results in our consolidated financial statements as we are its primary financial beneficiary 
as a result of the expiration of its agreement with the bermuda government  we do not expect to receive any future fees or revenues from cw bermuda 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results could differ significantly from such estimates and assumptions 
certain of our accounting estimates or assumptions constitute critical accounting estimates for us due to the fact that the nature of these estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition and results of operations is material 
our critical accounting estimates relate to i the valuation of our equity investment in our affiliate  oc bvi  ii goodwill and intangible assets  and iii plant construction revenues and costs 
valuation of equity investment in oc bvi 
we account for our investment in oc bvi under the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
this method requires recognition of a loss on an equity investment that is other than temporary  and indicates that a current fair value of an equity investment that is less than its carrying amount may indicate a loss in the value of the investment 
oc bvi s dispute and resulting litigation with the bvi government relating to the baughers bay plant have resulted in a fair value of our investment in oc bvi that was at one time less than our carrying value for this investment  as discussed in the paragraphs that follow 
as a quoted market price for oc bvi s stock is not available  to test for possible impairment of our investment in oc bvi we estimate its fair value through use of the discounted cash flow method  which relies upon seven year discrete projections of oc bvi s operating results  working capital and capital expenditures 
the use of this method requires us to estimate the cash flows from oc bvi s contract with the bvi government to supply water from its bar bay plant 
for the year ended december  and prior years  the use of this method also required us to estimate the cash flows oc bvi expected to obtain from the resolution of its dispute and resulting litigation with the bvi government over the ownership and operation of the baughers bay plant by i identifying various possible outcomes of the baughers bay litigation and estimating the cash flows associated with each possible outcome  and ii assigning a probability to each baughers bay outcome and associated expected cash flows based upon discussions held by oc bvi s management with the bvi government and oc bvi s legal counsel 
the resulting probability weighted sum represented the expected cash flows  and our best estimate of future cash flows  to be derived by oc bvi from the baughers bay litigation 
this sum was then added to oc bvi s estimated cash flows from its bar bay plant and the total was present valued to estimate oc bvi s fair value 
the identification of the possible outcomes for the baughers bay dispute  the projections of cash flows for each outcome  and the assignment of relative probabilities to each outcome all represented significant estimates made by us 
while we used our best judgment to identify the possible outcomes and expected cash flows for these outcomes and assign relative probabilities to each outcome  these estimates were by their nature highly subjective and were also subject to material change by our management over time based upon additional information from oc bvi s management and legal counsel  and a change in the status of oc bvi s litigation with the bvi government 
after considering the september and october rulings of the eastern caribbean supreme court the court relating to the baughers bay litigation and an announcement by the bvi government in february that it had signed a contract with another company to construct and operate a plant to provide potable water to the greater tortola area served by the baughers bay plant  we determined that the carrying value of our investment in oc bvi exceeded the estimated fair value for our investment in oc bvi and therefore recognized impairment losses aggregating approximately million for the year ended december  the remaining carrying value of our investment in oc bvi of million as of december  assumed that the bvi government would ultimately pay oc bvi the full amount awarded by the court in its rulings and fulfill its obligations to purchase water under the bar bay plant agreement 
in june  the eastern caribbean court of appeals issued the final ruling with respect to the baughers bay litigation 
this ruling dismissed the bvi government s appeal against the previous judgment of the court awarding million for the water supplied  and also awarded oc bvi compensation for improvements made to the plant in the amount equal to the difference between i the value of the baughers bay plant at the date oc bvi transferred possession of the plant to the bvi government and ii million the purchase price for the baughers bay plant under the agreement 
oc bvi was also awarded all of its court costs at the trial level and two thirds of such costs incurred on appeal 
prior to the final ruling the bvi government had paid only of the original million  and the remaining million amount due had increased to approximately million by the fourth quarter of due to the court costs awarded by the appellate court and the accrued interest due on the aggregate unpaid balance 
the bvi government paid oc bvi million of this amount during the fourth quarter of and the remaining million in january the remaining carrying value of our investment in oc bvi of million as of december  assumes that the bvi government will honor its obligations under bar bay plant water supply agreement 
if the bvi government fails to honor the terms of this agreement  the actual cash flows from oc bvi could vary materially from the expected cash flows we used in determining oc bvi s fair value as of december   and we would be required to record an additional loss to reduce the carrying value of our investment in oc bvi 
such impairment loss would reduce our earnings and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess cost over the fair value of the assets of an acquired business 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination accounted for as a purchase and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but are tested for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed periodically for impairment 
we evaluate the possible impairment of goodwill annually as part of our reporting process for the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
management identifies our reporting units and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units 
we determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare the fair value to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  we are required to perform the second step of the impairment test  as this is an indication that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired 
in this step  we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
if the implied fair value is less than its carrying amount  the impairment loss is recorded 
for the years in the three year period ended december  we estimated the fair value of our reporting units by applying the discounted cash flow method  the subject company stock price method  the guideline public company method  the mergers and acquisitions method and  on an exception basis and where necessary and appropriate  the net asset value method 
the discounted cash flow method relied upon seven year discrete projections of operating results  working capital and capital expenditures  along with a terminal value subsequent to the discrete period 
these seven year projections were based upon historical and anticipated future results  general economic and market conditions  and considered the impact of planned business and operational strategies 
the discount rates for the calculations represented the estimated cost of capital for market participants at the time of each analysis 
in preparing these seven year projections for for our retail unit we i identified various possible outcomes of our on going negotiations with the cayman islands government for the renewal of our retail license  ii estimated the cash flows associated with each possible outcome  and iii assigned a probability to each outcome and associated estimated cash flows 
the weighted average estimated cash flows were then summed to determine the overall fair value of the retail unit under this method 
the possible outcomes used for the discounted cash flow method for the retail unit included the implementation of a rate of return on invested capital model  the methodology proposed by cayman islands government representatives for the new retail license 
we also estimated the fair value of each of our reporting units for each of the years in the three year period ended december  through reference to the quoted market prices for our company and guideline companies and the market multiples implied by guideline merger and acquisition transactions 
for the year ended december  we also relied upon net asset values to estimate the fair value of our services unit 
we weighted the fair values estimated for each of our reporting units under each method and summed such weighted fair values to estimate the overall fair value for each reporting unit 
in recognition of the fact that our common stock has traded at prices less than its book value per share during the past two years we changed the relative weightings for from those used for to increase the weightings applied to those methods that resulted in more conservative estimates of fair value 
the respective weightings we applied to each method for the years ended december  and are as follows method retail bulk services retail bulk services discounted cash flow subject company stock price guideline public company mergers and acquisitions net asset value the fair values we estimated for our retail  bulk and services units exceeded their carrying amounts for the year ended december  the fair values we estimated for our retail and bulk units exceeded their carrying amounts by and  respectively  for the year ended december  the fair value we estimated for our services unit for the year ended december  was less than its carrying amount 
as a result of this estimate and our subsequent step analysis of the implied fair value of the goodwill recorded for our services unit  we recorded an impairment charge for the services unit goodwill of  for the year ended december  based upon the discounted cash flows and market approach methodologies employed in our analyses  no other impairment charges were required for our goodwill for any of the years in the three year period ended december  we also performed an analysis reconciling the conclusions of value for our reporting units to our market capitalization at october  this reconciliation resulted in an implied control premium for our company of 
plant construction revenue and cost of plant construction revenue 
we recognize revenue and related costs as work progresses on fixed price contracts for the construction of desalination plants to be sold to third parties using the percentage of completion method  which relies on contract revenue and estimates of total expected costs 
we follow this method since we can make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract 
under the percentage of completion method  we record revenue and recognize profit or loss as work on the contract progresses 
our engineering personnel estimate total project costs and profit to be earned on each long term  fixed price contract prior to commencement of work on the contract and update these estimates as work on the contract progresses 
the cumulative amount of revenue recorded on a contract at a specified point in time is that percentage of total estimated revenue that incurred costs to date comprise of estimated total contract costs 
as work progresses  if the actual contract costs exceed estimates  the profit recognized on revenue from that contract decreases 
we recognize the full amount of any estimated loss on a contract at the time the estimates indicate such a loss 
to date we have not experienced a material adverse variation from our cost estimates for plants constructed for sale to third parties 
we assume the risk that the costs associated with constructing the plant may be greater than we anticipated in preparing our bid 
however  the terms of each of the sales contracts with our customers require us to guarantee the sales price for the plant at the bid amount 
because we base our contracted sales price in part on our estimation of future construction costs  the profitability of our plant sales is dependent on our ability to estimate these costs accurately 
the cost estimates we prepare in connection with the construction of plants to be sold to third parties are subject to inherent uncertainties 
the cost of materials and construction may increase significantly after we submit our bid for a plant due to factors beyond our control  which could cause the gross margin for a plant to be less than we anticipated when the bid was made 
the gross profit we initially expect to generate from a plant sale could be further affected by other factors  such as hydro geologic conditions at the plant site that differ materially from those we believe exist and relied upon when we submitted our bid
