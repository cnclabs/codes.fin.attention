item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth under risk factors included in part i  item a or in other parts of this annual report on form k 
overview we have pioneered the next generation of network security with our innovative platform that allows enterprises  service providers  and government entities to secure their networks and safely enable the increasingly complex and rapidly growing number of applications running on their networks 
the core of our platform is our next generation firewall  which delivers application  user  and content visibility and control as well as protection against cyber threats integrated within the firewall through our proprietary hardware and software architecture 
our products and services can address a broad range of our end customers network security requirements  from the data center to the network perimeter  as well as the distributed enterprise  which includes branch offices and a growing number of mobile devices 
we derive revenue from sales of our products and services  which together comprise our platform 
product revenue is primarily generated from sales of our next generation firewall which is available in hardware and virtualized platforms 
all of our products incorporate our proprietary pan os operating system  which provides a consistent set of capabilities across our entire product line 
these capabilities include application visibility and control app id  user identification user id  site to site vpn  remote access ssl vpn  and quality of service qos 
our products are designed for different performance requirements throughout an organization which range from the pa  which is designed for enterprise remote offices  to the pa  which is designed for high speed data centers 
the same firewall functionality that is delivered in the hardware platforms is also available in the vm series virtual firewalls which secure virtualized and cloud based computing environments 
multiple firewalls can leverage the wildfire appliance  wf  which identifies  analyzes  and blocks known and unknown malware in a private cloud based environment 
our platform can be centrally managed in both virtualized and hardware platforms across an organization with our panorama product 
services revenue includes sales of subscriptions and support and maintenance 
our threat prevention  url filtering  globalprotect  and wildfire subscriptions provide our end customers with real time access to the latest antivirus  intrusion prevention  web filtering  and modern malware prevention capabilities across fixed and mobile devices 
when end customers purchase a product  they typically purchase one or more of our subscriptions for additional functionality  as well as support and maintenance in order to receive ongoing security updates  upgrades  bug fixes  and repairs 
sales of these services increase our deferred revenue balance and contribute significantly to our positive cash flow provided by operating activities 
we maintain a field sales force that works closely with our channel partners in developing sales opportunities 
we use a two tier  indirect fulfillment model whereby we sell our products and services to our global distributor channel partners  which  in turn  sell our products and services to our reseller network  which then sell to our end customers 
our channel partners purchase our products and services at a discount to our list prices before reselling them to our end customers 
our channel partners generally receive an order from an end customer prior to placing an order with us and generally do not stock appliances 
for the fiscal year  we added more than  new customers  including leading government organizations  large healthcare organizations  technology leaders and some of the largest fortune companies in the world 
we had more than  end customers in over countries as of july  our end customers represent a broad range of industries including education  energy  financial services  healthcare  internet and media  manufacturing  public sector  and telecommunications 
during fiscal  of our revenue was generated from the americas  from europe  the middle east  and africa emea  and from asia pacific and japan apac 
as of july   we had  employees 
we have experienced rapid growth in recent periods 
for fiscal   and  revenues were million  million  and million  respectively  representing year over year growth of for fiscal and for fiscal  despite continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment  in particular  weakness in emea and a slowdown in spending by the us government 
these macroeconomic factors may continue to impact overall spending in information technology it by our customers  which could adversely affect our revenues and operating results 
we continue to invest in innovation and strengthening our product portfolio  which resulted in several new product offerings during fiscal these new product offerings include the vm series  an all software virtualized next generation firewall platform that brings next generation network security into the virtualized data center environment  the paid subscription service for 
table of contents wildfire  our cloud based modern malware prevention service platform  the wf appliance which provides the ability to deploy wildfire in a customer private cloud  the pa series firewalls that provide mid range appliance options for enterprise customers  and lastly  the m management appliance  which offers an easy to deploy  high performance  dedicated appliance for our panorama management system 
fiscal financial highlights we added over  new end customers during fiscal and we had more than  end customers in over countries as of july  total revenue increased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal revenue increased in americas  in emea and in apac during fiscal compared to fiscal service revenue increased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal service revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased to during fiscal from during fiscal  which reflected the increasing recurring revenue in the business model and the rapid adoption of higher margin subscriptions services in our customer base 
as of july   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  and investments 
cash flow provided by operating activities increased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal deferred revenue increased to million as of july  from million as july  reflected the increased adoption of our support and maintenance and all our subscriptions services 
we completed the reorganization of our corporate structure and intercompany relationships to more closely align with the international nature of our business activities 
through changes in international procurement and sales operations  our corporate structure may cause short term volatility but is expected to reduce our overall effective tax rate over the long term 
we believe that the growth of our business and our short and long term success are dependent upon many factors  including our ability to extend our technology leadership  grow our base of end customers  expand deployment of our platform within existing end customers  and focus on end customer satisfaction 
while these areas present significant opportunities for us  they also pose challenges and risks that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results 
to manage any future growth effectively  we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure  our operating and administrative systems and controls  and our ability to manage headcount  capital  and processes in an efficient manner 
additionally  we face intense competition in our market  and to succeed  we need to innovate and offer products that are differentiated from existing infrastructure products  as well as effectively hire  retain  train  and motivate qualified personnel and senior management 
if we are unable to successfully address these challenges  our business  operating results  and prospects could be adversely affected 
key financial metrics we monitor the key financial metrics set forth below to help us evaluate growth trends  establish budgets  measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts  and assess operational efficiencies 
we discuss revenue  gross margin  and the components of operating income loss and margin below under financial overview and results of operations 
deferred revenue  cash flow provided by operating activities  and free cash flow non gaap are discussed immediately below the following table 
july  in thousands total deferred revenue cash  cash equivalents  and investments 
table of contents year ended july  dollars in thousands total revenue year over year percentage increase gross margin percentage operating income loss operating margin percentage cash flow provided by operating activities free cash flow non gaap deferred revenue 
our deferred revenue consists of amounts that have been invoiced but that have not yet been recognized as revenue as of the period end 
the majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of subscription and support and maintenance revenue that is recognized ratably over the contractual service period 
we monitor our deferred revenue balance because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods 
cash flow provided by operating activities 
we monitor cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of our overall business performance 
our cash flow provided by operating activities is driven in large part by sales of our products and from up front payments for both subscriptions and support and maintenance 
monitoring cash flow provided by operating activities enables us to analyze our financial performance without the non cash effects of certain items such as depreciation  amortization  and share based compensation costs  thereby allowing us to better understand and manage the cash needs of our business 
free cash flow non gaap 
we define free cash flow  a non gaap financial measure  as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property  equipment  and other assets 
we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that  after the purchases of property  equipment  and other assets  can be used for strategic opportunities  including investing in our business  making strategic acquisitions  and strengthening the balance sheet 
year ended july  in thousands cash flow cash flow provided by operating activities less purchase of property  equipment  and other assets free cash flow non gaap net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities financial overview revenue we derive revenue from sales of our products and services 
as discussed further in critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition below  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
our total revenue is comprised of the following product revenue 
the substantial majority of our product revenue is derived from sales of our appliances 
product revenue also includes revenue derived from software licenses of panorama  virtual systems upgrades  and the vm series 
we recognize product revenue at the time of shipment  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
as a percentage of total revenue  we expect our product revenue to vary from quarter to quarter based on seasonal and cyclical factors 

table of contents services revenue 
services revenue is derived primarily from threat prevention  url filtering  globalprotect  and wildfire subscriptions and support and maintenance 
our subscriptions are priced as a percentage of the appliance s list price 
our contractual subscription and support and maintenance terms are typically one to five years 
we recognize revenue from subscriptions and support and maintenance over the contractual service period 
as a percentage of total revenue  we expect our services revenue to remain at consistent levels or increase over the long term as we introduce new subscriptions  renew existing services contracts  and expand our end customer base 
cost of revenue our total cost of revenue consists of cost of product revenue and cost of services revenue 
our cost of revenue includes personnel costs  which consist of salaries  bonuses  and share based compensation associated with our operations and global customer support organizations

cost of product revenue 
cost of product revenue primarily includes costs paid to our third party contract manufacturer 
our cost of product revenue also includes product testing costs  allocated costs  warranty costs  shipping costs  and personnel costs associated with logistics and quality control 
we expect our cost of product revenue to increase as our product revenue increases 
cost of services revenue 
cost of services revenue includes personnel costs for our global customer support organization  allocated costs  and url filtering database service fees 
we expect our cost of services revenue to increase as our end customer base grows 
gross margin gross margin  or gross profit as a percentage of revenue  has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including the average sales price of our products  manufacturing costs  the mix of products sold  and the mix of revenue between products and services 
for sales of our products  our higher throughput firewall products generally have higher gross margins than our lower throughput firewall products within each product series 
for sales of our services  our subscriptions typically have higher gross margins than our support and maintenance 
we expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time depending on the factors described above 
operating expenses our operating expenses consist of research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expense 
personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries  benefits  bonuses  share based compensation  allocated costs  and with regard to sales and marketing expense  sales commissions 
we expect operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars  although they may fluctuate as a percentage of revenue from period to period  as we continue to grow in response to demand for our products and services 
as of july   we expect to recognize approximately million of share based compensation expense over a weighted average period of three years  excluding additional share based compensation expense related to any future grants of share based awards 
share based compensation expense  net of forfeitures  is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs 
research and development expense also includes prototype related expenses and allocated costs 
we expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our future products and services  although our research and development expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue

sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs including commission costs 
we expense commission costs as incurred

general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists of personnel costs as well as professional services 
general and administrative personnel include our executive  finance  human resources  and legal organizations 
professional services consist primarily of legal  auditing  accounting  and other consulting costs 
we 
table of contents expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars due to additional legal costs related to ongoing ip litigation  and additional costs associated with accounting  compliance  insurance  investor relations  and other costs associated with being a public company  although our general and administrative expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue 
refer to the discussion under legal proceedings included in part i  item of this annual report on form k for information related to pending litigation 
interest income interest income consists of income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and investments 
we expect interest income will increase as we grow our cash and investments portfolio depending on our average investment balances during the period  types and mix of investments  and market interest rates 
other expense  net other expense  net consists primarily of foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses  foreign currency transaction gains and losses  and the change in the fair value of our convertible preferred stock warrant liability 
convertible preferred stock warrants were classified as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets and remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date with the corresponding change recorded as other expense 
these warrants were exercised during the second quarter of fiscal  and therefore  no charges related to these warrants were incurred after that date 
we expect other expense to fluctuate depending on foreign exchange rate movements 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes consists primarily of federal and state income taxes in the united states  income taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business  and foreign withholding taxes 
we maintain a full valuation allowance for domestic deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carryforwards and research and development and other tax credits 
we expect the provision for income taxes to increase in absolute dollars in future years 
we have reorganized our corporate structure and intercompany relationships to more closely align with the international nature of our business activities 
this corporate structure may cause volatility to our overall effective tax rate in the short term but is expected to reduce our overall effective tax rate over the long term through changes in international procurement and sales operations

we believe that our cash flow from operations with existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate  the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  the introduction of new and enhanced products and services offerings  the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity  and the continuing market acceptance of our products 
in the event that additional financing is required from outside sources  we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses  and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results  our future financial statements will be affected 
the critical accounting policies requiring estimates  assumptions  and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below 
revenue recognition we generate revenue from the sales of hardware and software products  subscriptions  support and maintenance  and other services primarily through a direct sales force and indirect relationships with channel partners  and  to a lesser extent  directly to end customers 
revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met 
table of contents persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
we rely upon non cancelable sales agreements and purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement 
delivery has occurred 
we use shipping documents or transmissions of product or service contract registration codes to determine delivery 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
collectability is reasonably assured 
we assess collectability based on credit analysis and payment history 
we recognize product revenue at the time of shipment provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
our partners generally receive an order from an end customer prior to placing an order with us 
in addition  payment from our partners is not contingent on the partner s success in sales to end customers 
our partners generally do not stock appliances and only have limited stock rotation rights and no price protection rights 
when necessary  we make certain estimates and maintain allowances for sales returns and other programs based on our historical experience 
these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and management s judgment 
if actual results deviate significantly from our estimates  our revenue could be adversely affected 
we recognize services revenue from subscriptions and support and maintenance ratably over the contractual service period  which is typically one to five years 
other services revenue is recognized as the services are rendered and has not been significant to date 
most of our arrangements  other than renewals of subscriptions and support and maintenance  are multiple element arrangements with a combination of hardware  software  subscriptions  support and maintenance  and other services 
products and services generally qualify as separate units of accounting 
our hardware deliverables typically include proprietary operating system software  which together deliver the essential functionality of our products 
for multiple element arrangements  we allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on an estimated selling price at the arrangement inception 
the estimated selling price for each element is based upon the following hierarchy vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price  if available  third party evidence tpe of selling price  if vsoe of selling price is not available  or best estimate of selling price besp  if neither vsoe of selling price nor tpe of selling price are available 
the total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting using the relative estimated selling prices of each unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy 
we limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or meeting any specified performance conditions 
to determine the estimated selling price in multiple element arrangements  we establish vsoe of selling price using the prices charged for a deliverable when sold separately 
if vsoe of selling price cannot be established for a deliverable  we establish tpe of selling price by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated partners 
however  as our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and offer substantially different features and functionality from our competitors  we are unable to obtain comparable pricing of our competitors products with similar functionality on a standalone basis 
therefore  we have not been able to obtain reliable evidence of tpe of selling price 
if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price can be established for a deliverable  we establish besp primarily based on historical transaction pricing 
historical transactions are segregated based on our pricing model and our go to market strategy  which include factors such as type of sales channel reseller  distributor  or end customer  the geographies in which our products and services were sold domestic or international  offering type products or services  and whether or not the opportunity was identified by our sales force or by our partners 
in analyzing historical transaction pricing  we evaluate whether a majority of the prices charged for a product or service  as represented by a percentage of list price  fall within a reasonable range 
to further support the best estimate of selling price as determined by the historical transaction pricing or when such information is unavailable  such as when there are limited sales of a new product or service  we consider the same factors we have established through our pricing model and go to market strategy 
the determination of besp is made through consultation with and approval by our management 
in determining besp  we rely on certain assumptions and apply significant judgment 
as our business offerings evolve over time  we may be required to modify our estimated selling prices in subsequent periods  and our revenue could be adversely affected 
in multiple element arrangements where software deliverables are included  revenue is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the non software deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative estimated selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the aforementioned estimated selling price hierarchy 
the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is then allocated to each software deliverable using the residual method when vsoe of fair value of the undelivered items exists 
under the residual method  the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements 
in determining vsoe of fair value  we evaluate whether a substantial majority of the historical prices charged for a product or service sold on a standalone basis  as represented by a percentage of list price  fall within a reasonably narrow range 
if vsoe of fair value of one or more undelivered items does not exist  revenue from the entire arrangement is deferred and 
table of contents recognized at the earlier of i delivery of those elements or ii when fair value can be established unless support and maintenance is the only undelivered element  in which case  the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the contractual service period 
share based compensation compensation expense related to share based transactions  including employee and non employee director awards  is measured and recognized in the financial statements based on fair value 
the fair value of option awards and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan espp is estimated on the grant date 
the fair value of restricted stock units rsus is based on the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
the share based compensation expense  net of forfeitures  is recognized using a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards 
we estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the share based compensation expense for our awards 
our forfeiture rate is based on an analysis of our actual historical forfeitures 
the fair value of options and shares sold through our espp is determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
our option pricing model requires the input of the fair value of our common stock and other subjective assumptions  including the expected term of the award  the expected volatility of the price of our common stock  risk free interest rates  and the expected dividend yield of our common stock 
the assumptions used in our option pricing model represent management s best estimates 
these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
if factors change and different assumptions are used  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition to assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model  we must also estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the share based compensation expense for our awards 
quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant impact on our share based compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate  an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the share based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements 
if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate  an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the share based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements 
we will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our share based compensation expense on a prospective basis 
as we continue to accumulate additional data  we may have refinements to our estimates  which could materially impact our future share based compensation expense 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
in addition  deferred tax assets are recorded for the future benefit of utilizing net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards 
valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence  including past operating results  estimates of future taxable income  and the feasibility of tax planning strategies 
in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized  we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
we apply the authoritative accounting guidance prescribing a threshold and measurement attribute for the financial recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax liability as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
significant judgment is also required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
although we believe our reserves are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences may impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

table of contents estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans 
assumptions represent management s best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
should actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of our tax expense and liabilities could be materially impacted 
contract manufacturer liabilities we outsource most of our manufacturing  repair  and supply chain management operations to our independent contract manufacturer and payments to it are a significant portion of our product cost of revenues 
we have employees in our manufacturing and operations organization who manage our relationship with our independent contract manufacturer  manage our supply chain  and monitor product testing and quality 
although we could be contractually obligated to purchase manufactured products  we generally do not own the manufactured products 
product title transfers from our independent contract manufacturer to us and immediately to our partners upon shipment 
our independent contract manufacturer assembles our products using design specifications  quality assurance programs  and standards that we establish  and it procures components and assembles our products based on our demand forecasts 
these forecasts represent our estimates of future demand for our products based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions 
if the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecast  which may be caused by factors outside of our control  we accrue for costs for manufacturing commitments in excess of our forecasted demand including costs for excess components or for carrying costs incurred by our contract manufacturer  which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability 
to date  we have not accrued significant costs associated with this exposure 
loss contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset  or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss  in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
if we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined  then we disclose the range of the possible loss 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether an accrual is required  an accrual should be adjusted or a range of possible loss should be disclosed 
from time to time  we are involved in disputes  litigation  and other legal actions 
we are vigorously defending our current litigation matters 
however  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation  and these actions or other third party claims against us may cause us to incur substantial settlement charges  which are inherently difficult to estimate and could adversely affect our results of operations 
the actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses 
refer to the discussion under commitments and contingencies litigation in note to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k for information related to pending litigation 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long lived assets  including property and equipment  may not be recoverable 
when such events or changes in circumstances occur  we assess the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether or not the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the total of the future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset  we record an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the asset 
through july   our impairment write down of long lived assets was not material 
warranties we generally provide a one year warranty on hardware and a three month warranty on software 
we are indemnified by our contract manufacturer for product liability claims arising out of manufacturing defects 
we accrue for potential warranty claims as a component of cost of product revenues based on historical experience and other data 
accrued warranty is recorded in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and is reviewed periodically for adequacy 
if we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience  or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected  our gross margin could be adversely affected 
to date  we have not accrued any significant costs associated with our warranty

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars 
a portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside the united states and are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the euro  british pound  and japanese yen 
additionally  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statement of operations 
the effect of an immediate adverse change in foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities at july  would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations 
to date  foreign currency transaction gains and losses and exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to our financial statements  and we have not engaged in any foreign currency hedging transactions 
as our international operations grow  our risks associated with fluctuation in currency rates will become greater  and we will continue to reassess our approach to managing this risk 
in addition  currency fluctuations or a weakening us dollar can increase the costs of our international expansion 
interest rate risk the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal  provide liquidity  and maximize income without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities we invest in are subject to interest risk 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  us government and agency securities  and corporate debt securities 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a movement of in market interest rates would not have a material impact on our operating results and the total value of the portfolio 
the effect of an immediate change in interest rates at july  would not have been material to our financial statements assuming consistent investment levels
