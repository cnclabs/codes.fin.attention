radian group s five year cds spread was at december  radian group s five year cds spread is an illustration of the market s view of our non performance risk 
the cds spread used in the valuation of specific derivatives typically is based on the remaining term of the instrument 
the non performance risk is commonly measured by default probability  which lowers as the spread tightens 
radian group s five year cds spread at december  implies a market view that there is a probability that radian group will default in the next five years  as compared to an implied probability of default at december  although the cds spreads reflect the market view of our non performance risk  this magnitude of tightening should not be interpreted as a proportional decrease in our non performance risk
