during  digital media web properties attracted million visits and billion page views 
with the acquisition of ign entertainment  inc on february  see note subsequent events  the digital media business now attracts more than million global monthly unique visitors 
critical accounting policies and estimates in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenues 
business cloud services the company business cloud services revenues substantially consist of monthly recurring subscription and usage based fees  which are primarily paid in advance by credit card 
in accordance with gaap  the company defers the portions of monthly  quarterly  semi annually and annually recurring subscription and usage based fees collected in advance and recognizes them in the period earned 
additionally  the company defers and recognizes subscriber activation fees and related direct incremental costs over a subscriber estimated useful life 
j global business cloud services also include patent license revenues generated under license agreements that provide for the payment of contractually determined fully paid up or royalty bearing license fees to j global in exchange for the grant of non exclusive  retroactive and future licenses to our patented technology 
patent revenues may also consist of revenues generated from the sale of patents 
patent license revenues are recognized when earned over the term of the license agreements 
with regard to fully paid up license arrangements  the company generally recognizes as revenue in the period the license agreement is executed the portion of the payment attributable to past use of the patented technology and amortize the remaining portion of such payments on a straight line basis over the life of the licensed patent s 
with regard to royalty bearing license arrangements  the company recognizes revenues of license fees earned during the applicable period 
with regard to patent sales  the company recognizes as revenue in the period of the sale the amount of the purchase price over the carrying value of the patent s sold 
the business cloud services business also generates revenues by licensing certain technology to third parties 
these licensing revenues are recognized when earned in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreement 
generally  revenue is recognized as the third party uses the licensed technology over the period 
digital media the company digital media revenues primarily consist of revenue generated from the sale of advertising campaigns that are targeted to our proprietary websites 
revenue for these advertising campaigns is recognized as earned either when an ad is placed for viewing by a visitor to the appropriate web page or when the customer clicks through on the ad  depending upon the terms with the individual advertiser 
revenue for digital media business to business operations consists of lead generation campaigns for it vendors and is recognized as earned when the company delivers the qualified leads to the customer 
j global also generates digital media revenues through the license of certain assets to clients  for the clients use in their own promotional materials or otherwise 
such assets may include logos  editorial reviews  or other copyrighted material 
revenue under such license agreements is recognized when the assets are delivered to the client 
the digital media business also generates other types of revenue  including business listing fees  subscriptions to online publications  and from other sources 
such other revenues are recognized as earned 
investments 
we account for our investments in debt and equity securities in accordance with fasb asc topic no 
 investments debt and equity securities asc 
asc requires that certain debt and equity securities be classified into one of three categories trading  available for sale or held to maturity securities 
our investments are comprised primarily of readily marketable corporate and governmental debt securities  money market accounts and time deposits 
we determine the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of acquisition and reevaluate such determination at each balance sheet date 
held to maturity securities are those investments that we have the ability and intent to hold until maturity 
held to maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost 
available for sale securities are recorded at fair value  with unrealized gains or losses recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity until realized 
trading securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses included in interest and other income on our consolidated statement of income 
all securities are accounted for on a specific identification basis 
we assess whether an other than temporary impairment loss on an investment has occurred due to declines in fair value or other market conditions see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
share based compensation expense 
we comply with the provisions of fasb asc topic no 
 compensation stock compensation asc 
accordingly  we measure share based compensation expense at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and recognize the expense over the employee requisite service period using the straight line method 
the measurement of share based compensation expense is based on several criteria including  but not limited to  the valuation model used and associated input factors  such as expected term of the award  stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  dividend rate and award cancellation rate 
these inputs are subjective and are determined using management judgment 
if differences arise between the assumptions used in determining share based compensation expense and the actual factors  which become known over time  we may change the input factors used in determining future share based compensation expense 
any such changes could materially impact our results of operations in the period in which the changes are made and in periods thereafter 
we elected to adopt the alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of share based compensation and continue to use the simplified method in developing the expected term used for our valuation of share based compensation in accordance with asc long lived and intangible assets 
we account for long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc topic no 
 property  plant  and equipment asc  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could individually or in combination trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
if we determined that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we would record an impairment equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value 
we have assessed whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that potentially indicate the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable and noted no indicators of potential impairment for the years ended december   and  respectively 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
we evaluate our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment pursuant to fasb asc topic no 
 intangibles goodwill and other asc  which provides that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment 
in connection with the annual impairment test for goodwill  we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if we determine that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then we perform the impairment test upon goodwill 
in connection with the annual impairment test for intangible assets  we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of is less than its carrying amount  then we perform the impairment test upon intangible assets 
the impairment test is comprised of two steps a reporting unit fair value is compared to its carrying value  if the fair value is less than its carrying value  impairment is indicated  and if impairment is indicated in the first step  it is measured by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill and intangible assets to their carrying value at the reporting unit level 
we completed the required impairment review at the end of  and and noted no impairment 
consequently  no impairment charges were recorded 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb asc topic no 
 income taxes asc  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
asc also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our valuation allowance is reviewed quarterly based upon the facts and circumstances known at the time 
in assessing this valuation allowance  we review historical and future expected operating results and other factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are realizable 
income tax contingencies 
we calculate current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the following year 
adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified in the subsequent year 
asc provides guidance on the minimum threshold that an uncertain income tax position is required to meet before it can be recognized in the financial statements and applies to all tax positions taken by a company 
asc contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the income tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
if it is not more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on its technical merits  no benefit will be recorded 
uncertain income tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold 
we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions in income tax expense on our consolidated statement of income 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate uncertain income tax positions and establish or release reserves as appropriate under gaap 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions  and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions 
our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management assessment of relevant risks  facts and circumstances existing at that time 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially to reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
in addition  we may be subject to examination of our tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other domestic and foreign tax authorities 
we are currently under audit by the california ftb for tax years through the ftb has also issued information document requests regarding the tax year  although no formal notice of audit for has been provided 
we are also under income tax audits by the irs for tax years and and by the canada revenue agency cra for tax years through it is possible that one or more of these audits may conclude in the next months and that the unrecognized tax benefits we have recorded in relation to these tax years may change compared to the liabilities recorded for the periods 
however  it is not possible to estimate the amount  if any  of such change 
we establish reserves for these tax contingencies when we believe that certain tax positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax positions are fully supportable 
we adjust these reserves when changing events and circumstances arise 
non income tax contingencies 
we are currently under audit by various federal  state and local taxing authorities for non income related taxes  including the canada revenue agency regarding an audit for goods and services tax for tax years through in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc topic no 
 contingencies asc we make judgments regarding the future outcome of contingent events and record loss contingency amounts that are probable and reasonably estimable based upon available information 
the amounts recorded may differ from the actual income or expense that occurs when the uncertainty is resolved 
the estimates that we make in accounting for contingencies and the gains and losses that we record upon the ultimate resolution of these uncertainties could have a significant effect on the liabilities and expenses in our financial statements 
as of december   we had million of non income tax related contingent liabilities 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we reserve for receivables we may not be able to collect 
these reserves are typically driven by the volume of credit card declines and past due invoices and are based on historical experience as well as an evaluation of current market conditions 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates the adequacy of these reserves

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion of the market risks we face contains forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which reflect management s opinions only as of the date hereof 
j global undertakes no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward looking statements  except as required by law 
readers should carefully review the risk factors described in this document as well as in other documents we file from time to time with the sec  including the quarterly reports on form q and any current reports on form k filed or to be filed by us in interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve our principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve these objectives  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a mix of instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy 
our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments 
as of december   the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value 
our return on these investments is subject to interest rate fluctuations 
our short and long term investments are comprised primarily of readily marketable corporate and governmental debt securities and certificates of deposits 
investments in fixed rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us and foreign countries interest rates 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had investments in debt securities with effective maturities greater than one year of approximately million 
such investments had a weighted average yield of approximately 
as of december  and december   we had cash and cash equivalent investments in time deposits and money market funds with maturities of three months or less of million and million  respectively 
based on our cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investment holdings as of december   an immediate basis point decline in interest rates would decrease our annual interest income to approximately zero 
we are parties to the credit agreement with the lender  as amended 
if we were to borrow under the credit agreement we would be subject to the prevailing interest rates and could be exposed to interest rate fluctuations 
we cannot ensure that future interest rate movements will not have a material adverse effect on our future business  prospects  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
to date  we have not entered into interest rate hedging transactions to control or minimize certain of these risks 
foreign currency risk we conduct business in certain foreign markets  primarily in canada  australia and the european union 
our principal exposure to foreign currency risk relates to investment and inter company debt in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in functional currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the canadian dollar  euro  british pound sterling  australian dollar and japanese yen 
if we are unable to settle our short term intercompany debts in a timely manner  we remain exposed to foreign currency fluctuations 
as we expand our international presence  we become further exposed to foreign currency risk by entering new markets with additional foreign currencies 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements is often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of the international businesses into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
historically  we have not hedged translation risks because cash flows from international operations were generally reinvested locally  however  we may do so in the future 
our objective in managing foreign exchange risk is to minimize the potential exposure to changes that exchange rates might have on earnings  cash flows and financial position 
foreign exchange gains and losses were not material to our earnings in  or for the years ended december   and  net foreign currency transaction gain loss amounted to million  zero and million  respectively 
during the year ended december  and  cumulative translation adjustments included in other comprehensive income amounted to million and million  respectively 
we currently do not have derivative financial instruments for hedging  speculative or trading purposes and therefore are not subject to such hedging risk 
however  we may in the future engage in hedging transactions to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
