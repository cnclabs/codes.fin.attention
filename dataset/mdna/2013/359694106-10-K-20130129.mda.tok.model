see item business and note to the consolidated financial statements 
total company when reviewing our financial statements  it is important to understand how certain external factors impact us 
these factors include changes in the prices of our raw materials that are primarily derived from refining crude oil and natural gas global supply of and demand for raw materials economic growth rates  and currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar we purchase thousands of raw materials  the majority of which are petroleum natural gas derivatives 
with over percent of our cost of sales accounted for by raw materials  our financial results are extremely sensitive to changing costs in this area 
in addition to the impact from feedstock prices  the supply of and demand for raw materials also have a significant impact on our costs 
as demand increases in high growth areas  such as the asia pacific region  the supply of key raw materials may tighten  resulting in certain materials being put on allocation 
natural disasters  such as hurricanes  also can have an impact as key raw material producers are shut down for extended periods of time 
we continually monitor capacity utilization figures  market supply and demand conditions  feedstock costs and inventory levels  as well as derivative and intermediate prices  which affect our raw materials 
in  we generated percent of our net revenue in the us and percent in eimea 
the pace of economic growth in these areas directly impacts certain industries to which we supply products 
for example  adhesives related revenues from durable goods customers in areas such as appliances  furniture and other woodworking applications tend to fluctuate with the overall economic activity 
in business components such as construction products and insulating glass  revenues tend to move with more specific economic indicators such as housing starts and other construction related activity 
the movement of foreign currency exchange rates as compared to the us dollar impacts the translation of the foreign entities financial statements into us dollars 
as foreign currencies strengthen against the dollar  our 
table of contents revenues and costs increase as the foreign currency denominated financial statements translate into more dollars 
the fluctuations of the euro against the us dollar have the largest impact on our financial results as compared to all other currencies 
in  the currency fluctuations had a negative impact on net revenue of million as compared to key financial results and transactions for included the following net revenue increased percent from primarily driven by the acquired business 
gross profit margin decreased to percent from percent in and percent in mostly due to lower gross profit margins of the acquired business 
cash flow generated from operating activities was million in as compared to million in and million in acquired the global industrial adhesives and synthetic polymers business of forbo holding ag for million swiss francs or million 
inclusion of the acquired business increased net revenue by million 
divested our central america paints business for cash proceeds of million 
as part of this transaction  we recorded an after tax gain of million 
acquired engent  inc on september  for million 
the global economic conditions showed little or no improvement in our total year organic sales growth  which we define as the combined variances from product pricing and sales volume  was percent for compared to the inclusion of a rd week in negatively impacted organic sales growth by approximately percent 
lower gross profit margins of the acquired business contributed to a decrease in gross profit margin compared to in our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was per share compared to per share in and per share in the most significant factors affecting results were the percent increase in net revenue  the acquisition of the acquired business and special charges  net of million for costs related to the business integration project 
on an after tax basis  the special charges  net resulted in a million negative impact on net income and a negative effect on diluted earnings per share 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
in we had special charges  net of million related to the pending acquisition of the acquired business 
on an after tax basis  this was a negative million impact on net income and a negative effect on diluted earnings per share 
in we had exit costs and impairment charges to exit our european polysulfide based insulating glass product line  which resulted in a pre tax loss of million 
on an after tax basis  this was a negative million impact on net income and a negative effect on diluted earnings per share 
outlook for  we expect to achieve modest organic revenue growth from our key focus markets of hygiene  packaging and durable assembly and by taking advantage of higher growth opportunities in emerging economies where consumer spending is growing at a higher rate than the overall global economy 
in addition  we expect some margin expansion as we realize more of the synergy benefits from the business integration project that began after the purchase of the acquired business 
we expect our cost of raw materials in to be similar to despite the continued high cost of raw materials  our gross margin should improve as we continue to manage pricing actions  reformulations and product substitutions 
we also expect operating expenses to be leveraged to enhance our operating margin in 
table of contents our capital spending plans for are much higher than actual spending in previous years as a significant portion of the investment for the business integration project is completed 
this reflects our confidence in our business and the opportunities we see to improve the productivity of our business and our prospects for growth 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates management s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe the critical accounting policies and areas that require the most significant judgments and estimates to be used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are pension and other postretirement plan assumptions  goodwill impairment assessment  long lived assets recoverability  product  environmental and other litigation liabilities  and income tax accounting 
pension and other postretirement plan assumptions we sponsor defined benefit pension plans in both the us and us entities 
also in the us we sponsor other postretirement plans for health care and life insurance benefits 
expenses and liabilities for the pension plans and other postretirement plans are actuarially calculated 
these calculations are based on our assumptions related to the discount rate  expected return on assets  projected salary increases and health care cost trend rates 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of assumptions employed in these measurements for both the non us and non us plans 
the discount rate assumption is determined using an actuarial yield curve approach  which enables us to select a discount rate that reflects the characteristics of the plan 
the approach identifies a broad universe of corporate bonds that meet the quality and size criteria for the particular plan 
we use this approach rather than a specific index that has a certain set of bonds that may or may not be representative of the characteristics of our particular plan 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of the pension obligations 
the discount rate for the us pension plan was percent at december   as compared to percent at december  and percent at november  net periodic pension cost for a given fiscal year is based on assumptions developed at the end of the previous fiscal year 
a discount rate reduction of percentage points at december  would increase us pension and other postretirement plan expense approximately million pre tax in fiscal discount rates for non us plans are determined in a manner consistent with the us plan 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption for the us pension plan was percent in compared to percent for and for our expected long term rate of return on us plan assets was based on our target asset allocation assumption of percent equities and percent fixed income 
management  in conjunction with our external financial advisors  determines the expected long term rate of return on plan assets by considering the expected future returns and volatility levels for each asset class that are based on historical returns and forward looking observations 
for the expected long term rate of return on the target equities allocation was percent and the expected long term rate of return on the target fixed income allocation was percent 
the total plan rate of return assumption included an estimate of the impact of diversification and the plan expense 
for  the expected long term rate of return on assets will be percent with an expected long term rate of return on the target equities allocation of percent and an expected long term rate of return on target fixed income allocation of percent 
a change of percentage points for the expected return on assets assumption would impact us net pension and other postretirement plan expense by approximately million pre tax 
management  in conjunction with our external financial advisors  uses the actual historical rates of return of the asset categories to assess the reasonableness of the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the most 
table of contents recent year and year historical equity returns are shown in the table below 
our expected rate of return on our total portfolio is consistent with the historical patterns observed over longer time frames 
us pension plan historical actual rates of return total portfolio equities fixed income year period year period beginning in  our target allocation migrated from percent equities to our current allocation of percent equities and percent fixed income 
the historical actual rate of return for the fixed income of percent is since inception years 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption for non us pension plans was a weighted average of percent in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption used in each non us plan is determined on a plan by plan basis for each local jurisdiction and is based on expected future returns for the investment mix of assets currently in the portfolio for that plan 
management  in conjunction with our external financial advisors  develops expected rates of return for each plan  considers expected long term returns for each asset category in the plan  reviews expectations for inflation for each local jurisdiction  and estimates the impact of active management of the plan s assets 
our largest non us pension plans are in germany and the united kingdom respectively 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets for germany was percent and the historical rate of return since inception years for the total asset portfolio in germany was percent 
the expected rate of return on our german portfolio of percent assumes that market returns will improve in the future to be more in line with historical market patterns observed over longer time frames 
in addition  we have modified our investment strategy for the german plan to include a more diversified pool of equity and fixed income investments and  therefore  we currently expect the performance of the plan assets to improve going forward 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets for the united kingdom was percent and the historical rate of return since inception years for the total asset portfolio in the united kingdom was percent 
management  in conjunction with our external financial advisors  uses actual historical returns of the asset portfolio to assess the reasonableness of the expected rate of return for each plan 
since both of these non us plans have been in existence for less than years  the historical rate of return for each plan has been affected by a period of very poor market conditions by any longer term standards 
the rates of return that have been earned by these plans over this shorter time is not what management or our external advisors expect in more normal economic times and over the long period these assets will be invested 
during  we announced significant changes to our us pension plan the plan 
the changes included benefits under the plan were locked in using service and salary as of may   participants no longer earn benefits for future service and salary as they had in the past  affected participants receive a three percent increase to the locked in benefit for every year they continue to work for us and we are making a retirement contribution of three percent of eligible compensation to the k plan for those participants 
these changes to the plan represented a plan curtailment as there is no longer a service cost component in the net periodic pension cost as all participants are considered inactive in the plan 
the projected salary increase assumption is based on historic trends and comparisons to the external market 
higher rates of increase result in higher pension expenses 
as this rate is also a long term expected rate  it is less likely to change on an annual basis 
in the us  we have used the rate of percent for  percent for and percent for goodwill goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a purchase business combination 
goodwill is assigned to reporting units at the date the goodwill is initially recorded 
once goodwill has been assigned to a reporting unit  it no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition  and all the activities within a reporting unit are available to support the value of goodwill 
accounting standards require us to test goodwill for impairment annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the estimated fair value 

table of contents the goodwill impairment analysis is a two step process 
the first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 
we use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
our judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model 
these assumptions include revenue growth rates  profit margin percentages  discount rates  perpetuity growth rates  future capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is considered to not be impaired 
if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value  there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment 
the second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination  by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one  over the estimated fair values of the individual assets  liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit  there is no impairment 
if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 
an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit  and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill 
subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted 
in the fourth quarter of  we conducted the required annual test of goodwill for impairment 
we performed the goodwill impairment analysis on our reporting units by using a discount rate at the high end of our range 
there were no indications of impairment in any of our reporting units 
of the goodwill balance of million as of december   million is allocated to the eimea reporting unit and million is allocated to the north america adhesives reporting unit 
in both of these reporting units  the calculated fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value of the net assets 
the construction products reporting unit had a goodwill balance of million as of december  the calculated fair value of this reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately percent 
the goodwill balance in the latin america adhesives reporting unit is million as of december  and the calculated fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately percent 
the goodwill balance in the asia pacific reporting unit is million as of december  the calculated fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately percent 
in all three of these reporting units  the calculated fair value exceeded the carrying value by a reasonable margin 
the construction products reporting unit continues to be the reporting unit with the least amount of excess fair value over carrying value 
the residential construction market in the us stabilized in and in our construction products reporting unit had net revenue growth of percent over  mainly due to increased sales volume 
projected cash flows used in the fair value calculation in the fourth quarter of were based on continued growth in of percent 
for years beyond  net revenue projections assume continued growth in the mid single digits through with a leveling off in the low single digits for the remaining years 
operating income for the construction products reporting unit is projected to grow primarily due to revenue growing at a higher rate than selling  general and administrative sg a expenses thereby providing better leverage in earnings in future years and manufacturing capacity efficiency improvements in and beyond 
although we believe the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the construction products reporting unit are realistic  another slowdown or decline in the us residential construction industry could have an adverse impact on construction products future cash flows 
the latin america adhesives reporting unit had net revenue growth of percent in compared to projected cash flows used in the fair value calculation in the fourth quarter of were based on continued growth in of percent 
for years beyond  net revenue projections assume continued growth in the low single digits for the remaining years 
operating earnings for the latin america adhesives reporting unit are projected to grow primarily due to revenue growing at a higher rate than sg a expenses 

table of contents the asia pacific reporting unit had net revenue growth of percent in compared to projected cash flows used in the fair value calculation in the fourth quarter of were based on continued growth in of percent 
for years beyond  net revenue projections assume continued growth in the low double digits through with a leveling off in the mid single digits for the remaining years 
operating earnings for the asia pacific reporting unit are projected to grow primarily due to revenue growing at a higher rate than sg a expenses 
if the economy or business environment falter and we are unable to achieve our assumed revenue growth rates or profit margin percentages  our projections used would need to be remeasured  which could impact the carrying value of our goodwill in one or more of our reporting units 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
recoverability of long lived assets the assessment of the recoverability of long lived assets reflects our assumptions and estimates 
factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume  prices  inflation  currency exchange rates  tax rates and capital spending 
significant judgment is involved in estimating these factors  and they include inherent uncertainties 
the measurement of the recoverability of these assets is dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions used in making these estimates and how the estimates compare to the eventual future operating performance of the specific businesses to which the assets are attributed 
judgments made by us include the expected useful lives of long lived assets 
the ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets is affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets  changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
in we exited our polysulfide based insulating glass product line in europe 
in accordance with accounting standards  we determined that the carrying amount of this asset group was not recoverable and was therefore impaired 
we calculated the fair value of the asset group using a discounted cash flow approach 
as a result of this analysis  we recorded pre tax asset impairment charges of million to write down the value of amortizable intangible assets 
product  environmental and other litigation liabilities as disclosed in item and in note and note to the consolidated financial statements  we are subject to various claims  lawsuits and other legal proceedings 
reserves for loss contingencies associated with these matters are established when it is determined that a liability is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the assessment of the probable liabilities is based on the facts and circumstances known at the time that the financial statements are being prepared 
for cases in which it is determined that a liability is probable but only a range for the potential loss exists  the minimum amount of the range is recorded and subsequently adjusted as better information becomes available 
for cases in which insurance coverage is available  the gross amount of the estimated liabilities is accrued  and a receivable is recorded for any probable estimated insurance recoveries 
as of december   we have accrued million for potential liabilities and million for potential insurance recoveries related to asbestos litigation 
we also have recorded million for environmental investigation and remediation liabilities  including million for environmental remediation and monitoring activities at our sorocaba  brazil facility as of december  a discussion of environmental  product and other litigation liabilities is disclosed in item and note to the consolidated financial statements 
based upon currently available facts  we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of any pending legal proceeding  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our long term financial condition 
however  adverse developments and or periodic settlements could negatively affect our results of operations or cash flows in one or more future quarters 
income tax accounting as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the process involves 
table of contents estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
increases in the valuation allowance result in additional expense to be reflected within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of income 
as of december   the valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets totaled million 
we recognize tax benefits for tax positions for which it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained by the applicable tax authority at the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we do not recognize a financial statement benefit for a tax position that does not meet the more likely than not threshold 
we believe that our liabilities for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome 
it is difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution of any particular tax position 
future changes in judgment related to the resolution of tax positions will impact earnings in the quarter of such change 
we adjust our income tax liabilities related to tax positions in light of changing facts and circumstances 
settlement with respect to a tax position would usually require cash 
based upon our analysis of tax positions taken on prior year returns and expected tax positions to be taken for the current year tax returns  we have identified gross uncertain tax positions of million as of december  we have not recorded us deferred income taxes for certain of our non us subsidiaries undistributed earnings as such amounts are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the us should we change our business strategies related to these non us subsidiaries  additional us tax liabilities could be incurred 
it is not practical to estimate the amount of these additional tax liabilities

the net revenue was million or percent higher than the net revenue of  million in we review variances in net revenue in terms of changes related to product pricing  sales volume  changes in foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions 
the following table shows the net revenue variance analysis for the past two years vs vs product pricing sales volume currency acquisitions organic sales growth  which we define as the combined variances from product pricing and sales volume  increased percent in as compared to the inclusion of a rd week in negatively impacted organic sales growth by approximately percent 
the percent organic sales growth in was led by percent growth in construction products  percent growth in eimea  percent growth in latin america adhesives and percent growth in north america adhesives 
substantially all of the negative

the acquired business increased net revenue by million 
organic sales growth increased percent positive percent from selling prices and percent from sales volume in as compared to the sales volume included approximately percent in incremental net revenue related to the rd week 
four of our five operating segments had double digit organic sales growth in compared to the percent organic sales growth was driven by percent growth in latin america adhesives  percent growth in asia pacific  percent growth in eimea  percent growth in construction products and percent growth in north america adhesives 
the net revenue variance from acquisitions was mainly due to the revertex finewaters acquisition in the third quarter of cost of sales in millions vs vs raw materials other manufacturing costs cost of sales percent of net revenue cost of sales increased percent in compared to the increase in raw materials is primarily attributed to the incremental volume of the acquired business combined with a slight increase in raw material costs 
raw material cost as a percentage of net revenue increased basis points as the inclusion of the acquired business that generates lower margins relative to the legacy business more than offset the benefit of higher average sales prices on this ratio 
cost of sales as a percent of net revenue increased by basis points in the cost of sales increased percent in compared to the increase was driven primarily by the increases in raw material cost due to supply shortages 
each of our five operating segments was impacted by the rising raw material costs 
the shortages were driven by refineries reducing the supply of the by products that are used as raw materials in the production of adhesives and increased demand in adjacent industries 
the cost of sales included million of charges related to the exit of the window polysulfide based product line in our eimea operating segment 
cost of sales as a percent of net revenue increased to percent in compared to percent in gross profit in millions vs vs gross profit percent of net revenue gross profit increased by million compared to  however  gross profit margin decreased by basis points 
the inclusion of the acquired business which generates lower margins relative to the legacy business was the primary reason for both the increase in gross profit and the lower margin percentage 
our gross profit margin decreased to percent in from percent in the lower gross profit margin for as compared to was due to the increases in raw material costs which were not completely offset by our price increases implemented in 
table of contents selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in millions vs vs sg a percent of net revenue our sg a expenses increased million or percent compared to this increase is primarily attributable to the addition of the acquired business

in addition  in july of we announced our intentions to take a series of actions in our existing eimea operating segment to improve the profitability and future growth prospects of this operating segment 
we have combined these two initiatives into a single project which we refer to as the business integration project 
during the years ended december  and december   we incurred special charges  net of million and million respectively  for costs related to the business integration project 
acquisition and transformation related costs of million for the year ended december  include costs related to organization consulting  investment advisory  financial advisory  legal and valuation services necessary to acquire and integrate the acquired business into our existing operating segments 
for the year ended december   we also incurred other costs related to the acquisition including an expense of million to make a bridge loan available if needed and an expense of million related to the purchase of a foreign currency option to hedge a portion of the acquisition purchase price 
for the year ended december   we incurred acquisition and transformation related costs of million for investment advisory  financial advisory  legal and valuation services necessary to acquire the acquired business and an expense of million related to the purchase of a foreign currency option to hedge a portion of the acquisition purchase price 

table of contents during the first quarter of  we entered into forward currency contracts maturing on march  to purchase million swiss francs at a blended forward rate of usd chf 
our objective was to economically hedge the purchase price for the pending acquisition of the global industrial adhesives business of forbo group after the price was established 
the currency contracts were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
when the acquisition closed on march   the forward currency contracts were settled at a rate of usd chf 
for the year ended december   the net gain on the forward currency contracts was million which partially offset other acquisition and transformation related costs 
for the year ended december   we incurred workforce reduction costs of million  facility exit costs of million and other costs of million related to the business integration project 
the business integration project is a broad based transformation plan involving all major processes in three of our existing operating segments 
the integration strategy and execution plan is unique for each operating segment reflecting the differences within the legacy operating segments as well as differences within the acquired business in each geographic region 
in the north america adhesives operating segment  the integration work is essentially a consolidation of two similar businesses 
the customer facing portion of the two businesses sales  marketing and technical has been combined into a new  streamlined organization that is designed to be more efficient and more responsive to customer needs 
the production capacity of the two organizations is being optimized mostly by transferring volume from the acquired business to existing facilities within the legacy north america adhesives operating segment 
since capacity already exists within the receiving facilities  the capital investment required to transfer this production and the time required to affect these transfers will be minimized 
in the eimea operating segment  the business integration project impacts more aspects of the business and is more complex 
the two businesses being combined have similar inefficiencies and opportunities for improved productivity  generally due to excess complexity within the core processes of each of the businesses 
similar to the north america adhesives project  the customer facing organizations have been optimized by combining the two organizations into one new  streamlined organization that is more efficient and more responsive to the unique customer groups we serve 
in addition  the support and administrative functions of both businesses are in the process of being reorganized and in many cases relocated to create more efficient functions 
the integration of the production assets will be more complicated in eimea because both the legacy business manufacturing network and the acquired business manufacturing network are inefficient and in need of upgrades 
in this region the restructuring of the production footprint will be more extensive with several existing plants closed and new  enhanced production facilities constructed to provide greater operating efficiencies and a solid foundation for future growth 
this portion of the project will require more capital investment  higher restructuring and severance costs and a longer time frame when compared to the north america adhesives portion of the project 
in the asia pacific operating segment  the business integration project is less complex because the acquired business in that region was relatively small 
the focus of the integration work in this region is to build a solid foundation for growth in the commercial and technical areas and  over time  create a more efficient production network in china 
the benefits of the business integration project are expected to be substantial 
we have plans to create annual cash cost savings and other cash pre tax profit improvement benefits aggregating to million when the various integration activities are completed in by  the business integration project activities are expected to improve the ebitda margin of the global business from just under percent in to a target level of percent 
the project incorporates many different work streams each of which has a specific timeline for completion and delivery of benefits 
some of the initiatives  such as raw material cost reductions  have delivered immediate benefits while other initiatives  such as facility closures  will take longer to implement and the related cost savings will be achieved later in the project 
taking the expected impact of all initiatives into account  the profit improvement benefits from the project and the resulting improvement in ebitda margin should occur in generally equal increments over the eight quarters commencing in the third quarter of through the second quarter of 
table of contents the total costs  excluding capital expenditures  to achieve these benefits are expected to be approximately million of which million have been expensed since inception of the business integration project in the remaining expected costs of approximately million will occur over the next several quarters through the end of the following table provides detail of costs incurred and future expected costs of the business integration project as of december  in millions costs incurred inception to date expected costs remaining total expected costs acquisition and transformation related costs other related costs work force reduction costs cash facility exit costs non cash facility exit costs business integration project the remaining expected business integration project costs of million will be incurred over several quarters as the measures are implemented  and will total approximately million in fiscal year and approximately million in fiscal year the costs associated with the acquisition integration and the cash costs of the restructuring are incremental cash outlays that will be funded with existing cash and cash generated from operations 
non cash costs are primarily related to accelerated depreciation of long lived assets 
the capital expenditures related to the business integration project will be significant 
our initial estimates made at the time of the acquisition  were that annual capital expenditures would increase to approximately million for fiscal years  and  a significant increment above our normal spending rate of approximately million 
in we spent less than million in capital expenditures 
as the project has progressed and the scope of the various projects are more fully defined  we have changed our forecasts 
going forward  we expect capital expenditures to reach million in and the aggregate of spending in the years and is expected to be million 
this updated capital spending forecast for all projects including the business integration project is consistent with our original forecast  only modified to reflect better estimates of the timing of capital expenditures 
this capital spending program will be funded from the operating cash flows of the business and if necessary  from available cash and short term borrowing 
going forward  we plan to report our progress on achieving our profit improvement initiatives each quarter 
we will focus on three key metrics which capture the bulk of the business integration project objectives cost savings achieved through workforce reductions  cost reductions achieved through facility closures and consolidation  and the ebitda margin of the business relative to our expected trend over the timeframe of the project 
in addition  the costs to achieve these benefits will be reported relative to the million total expected cost estimate in each reporting period 
for the year ended december   we achieved cost savings of million related to workforce reductions and million related to facility closures and consolidations 
the above cost savings represent benefits from selected activities included in the business integration project 
ebitda margin for the fourth quarter of percent exceeded our plan 
the specific work streams of the business integration project which have been approved by management and recorded in our results of operations are as follows in january  we initiated a facility closure and transfer plan as part of our previously announced actions in our existing eimea operating segment  including the closure of facilities in wels  austria and borgolavezzaro  
table of contents italy and the transfer of shared services functions to a single location in mindelo  portugal 
we expected to incur total exit costs of approximately million related to these actions 
in may  we announced an additional plan for the integration of the acquired business in our eimea operating segment  including the closure of three additional production facilities located in chatteris  united kingdom  pirmasens  germany and vigo  spain 
we expect to incur additional exit costs of approximately million related to these actions 
the total exit costs of million for this portion of the business integration project include expenditures of approximately million primarily for severance and employee related costs  approximately million for other associated cash costs primarily related to facility shut downs and non cash charges of approximately million  primarily related to accelerated depreciation of long lived assets 
this portion of the business integration project began in the first quarter and is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year in april  we approved a plan for the integration of the acquired business in our north america adhesives operating segment  including the closure of six production facilities located in pointe claire  quebec  morris  illinois  kansas city  kansas  eugene  oregon  jackson  tennessee and dallas  texas 
we expect to incur exit costs of approximately million related to these actions 
the exit costs for this portion of the business integration project include expenditures of approximately million for severance and related employee costs and approximately million for other associated cash costs  primarily related to facility shutdowns 
this portion of the business integration project began in the second quarter and is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year in october of  we approved a plan for the integration of the acquired business in our asia pacific operating segment  including the closure of two production facilities located in shanghai and guangzhou  china

total return is calculated using trailing month information 
total invested capital is defined as the sum of notes payable  current maturities of long term debt  long term debt  redeemable non controlling interest and total equity 
roic was introduced because we believe it provides a true measure of return on capital invested 
we believe it is an effective way to internally measure performance and it is focused on the long term

these plans and expectations are based upon certain underlying assumptions  including those mentioned with the specific statements 
such assumptions are in turn based upon internal estimates and analyses of current market conditions and trends  our 
table of contents plans and strategies  economic conditions and other factors 
these plans and expectations and the assumptions underlying them are necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in projecting future conditions and results 
actual results could differ materially from expectations expressed in the forward looking statements if one or more of the underlying assumptions and expectations proves to be inaccurate or is unrealized 
in addition to the factors described in this report  item a

in order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor  we have identified these important factors which could affect our financial performance and could cause our actual results for future periods to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward looking statements 
these factors should be considered  together with any similar risk factors or other cautionary language that may be made elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the list of important factors in item a

this disclosure  including that under forward looking statements and risk factors  and other forward looking statements and related disclosures made by us in this report and elsewhere from time to time  represents our best judgment as of the date the information is given 
we do not undertake responsibility for updating any of such information  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise  except as required by law 
investors are advised  however  to consult any further public company disclosures such as in filings with the sec or in our press releases on related subjects 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency rates and prices of raw materials 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
our financial performance has been  and may continue to be  negatively affected by unfavorable economic conditions 
continued or further recessionary economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our sales volumes  pricing levels and profitability 
as domestic and international economic conditions change  trends in discretionary consumer spending also become unpredictable and subject to reductions due to uncertainties about the future 
a general reduction in consumer discretionary spending due to a recession in the domestic and international economies  or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
interest rate risk exposure to changes in interest rates results primarily from borrowing activities used to fund operations 
committed floating rate credit facilities are used to fund a portion of operations 
we believe that probable near term changes in interest rates would not materially affect financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the annual impact on interest expense of a one percentage point interest rate change on the outstanding balance of our variable rate debt as of december  would be approximately million or per diluted share 
foreign exchange risk as a result of being a global enterprise  there is exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect operating results and financial condition 
approximately percent of net revenue was generated outside of the united states in principal foreign currency exposures relate to the euro  british pound sterling  canadian dollar  chinese renminbi  japanese yen  australian dollar  swiss franc  argentine peso  brazilian real  colombian peso  mexican peso  turkish lira  egyptian pound  indian rupee  and malaysian ringgit 
our objective is to balance  where possible  local currency denominated assets to local currency denominated liabilities to have a natural hedge and minimize foreign exchange impacts 
we enter into cross border transactions through importing and exporting goods to and from different countries and locations 
these transactions generate foreign exchange risk as they create assets  liabilities and cash flows in currencies other 
table of contents than the local currency 
this also applies to services provided and other cross border agreements among subsidiaries 
we take steps to minimize risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through normal operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative instruments 
we do not enter into any speculative positions with regard to derivative instruments 
from a sensitivity analysis viewpoint  based on financial results and foreign currency balance sheet positions as of december   a hypothetical overall percent change in the us dollar would have resulted in a change in net income of approximately million or per diluted share 
raw materials the principal raw materials used to manufacture products include resins  polymers  synthetic rubbers  vinyl acetate monomer and plasticizers 
we generally avoid sole source supplier arrangements for raw materials 
while alternate supplies of most key raw materials are available  unplanned supplier production outages may lead to strained supply demand situations for several key raw materials such as ethylene and propylene  several polymers and other petroleum derivatives such as waxes 
the purchase of raw materials is our largest expenditure 
our objective is to purchase raw materials that meet both our quality standards and production needs at the lowest total cost 
most raw materials are purchased on the open market or under contracts that limit the frequency but not the magnitude of price increases 
in some cases  however  the risk of raw material price changes is managed by strategic sourcing agreements which limit price increases to increases in supplier feedstock costs  while requiring decreases as feedstock costs decline 
the leverage of having substitute raw materials approved for use wherever possible is used to minimize the impact of possible price increases
