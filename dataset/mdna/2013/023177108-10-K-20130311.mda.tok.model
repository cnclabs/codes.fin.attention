item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a cautionary discussion regarding forward looking statements 
deterioration of and extreme volatility in general economic conditions and consumer spending conditions could result in a decline in the number of people willing to purchase our premium travel products 
demand for our products and services may be significantly affected by the general level of economic activity  level of discretionary spending and employment levels in the united states and key international markets 
therefore  global economic downturns or a recession could have a material adverse effect on our business  cash flows and our results of operations 
the united states and other markets continue to face these conditions which have impacted demand in the travel industry  the markets in which we operate and our profitability 
we expect these conditions will continue to impact our operations and profitability for the foreseeable future 
a decline in the travel industry could adversely affect our results of operations 
our results of operations depend upon factors affecting the travel industry in general 
our earnings are especially sensitive to events that affect domestic and international air travel and availability of lodging and transportation 
a number of factors  including a rise in fuel prices or other travel costs  which if passed along later in our travel season could decrease our ability to pass these costs onto our participants  reduction of airline capacity causing prices to increase  excessive inflation  currency fluctuations within the global market  the strength of the dollar  foreign taxation changes  extreme weather conditions and concerns about passenger safety could result in a temporary or longer term overall decline in demand for our programs 
if we are ineffective in our marketing efforts or are unable to obtain quality leads or prospects  our future growth and profitability could be impacted 
performance in our travel programs is substantially reliant on our ability to attract and retain travelers through our direct and indirect marketing efforts 
the effectiveness of marketing efforts is highly dependent on our ability to identify and obtain productive lead sources  execute direct mail strategies  secure attendance and conversion at our local informational meetings  increase our digital presence  including the number of website visitors and unique users  and develop our brands 
failure or underperformance of our marketing efforts  including changes in the direct mail environment and the company s reputation with teachers and potential participants could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
such changes in the direct mail environment could include  but are not limited to  new or different regulatory schemes or changes in costs or services by the united states postal service 
business interruption due to natural occurrences  international political or terrorist activities and threats thereof  and other world events or incidents affecting the health  safety  security and or program satisfaction of individuals without adequate insurance coverage or preparedness could have an adverse effect on our profitability 
our operations are subject to unique risks inherent in doing business internationally  as most of our travel programs are conducted outside of the united states 
demand for our travel programs may be adversely affected by natural occurrences such as hurricanes  tsunamis  earthquakes  extreme flooding  and epidemics or other disease outbreaks such as influenza in geographic regions in which we conduct travel programs 
in the event potential risks  such as war  us military deployments  international and domestic terrorism  civil disturbances  political instability  governmental activities and deprivation of contract rights occur  they may impact our customers willingness to travel to these destinations or our ability to deliver planned programs 

table of contents the consequences of these types of events are unpredictable and the occurrence of any of the events described above  or other unforeseen developments in one or more of the regions in which we travel  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to acquire  retain  and or travel enrollments  which would substantially impact profitability  cash flows  and results of operations 
historically  we have experienced increased cancellations for our travel programs during such times and if these business interruptions occur during the peak travel season  the impact can be magnified 
we depend on our ability to attract and retain our key personnel with industry specific knowledge 
our performance is dependent on the continued services and performance of our senior management and certain other key personnel that have experience pertinent to success in the educational travel industry 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could have an adverse effect on our business operations  along with our ability to grow our business  generate innovative ideas  remain strategic  and recruit and maintain highly functional teams 
our future success also depends on our ability to identify  attract  hire  train  retain and motivate other highly skilled managerial  sales  marketing and customer service personnel 
our inability to do so could have an adverse effect on our business  cash flows and results of operations 
on february   jeffrey d 
thomas resigned as our president  chief executive officer and director and margaret m 
thomas resigned as our executive vice president and as president and chief operating officer of our subsidiary  ambassador programs  inc our chief financial officer  anthony f 
dombrowik  is currently serving as our interim president and chief executive officer 
although we are in the process of seeking qualified candidates to replace mr 
thomas and or ms 
thomas  we may not be successful in identifying  hiring and or retaining executives with suitable skills and experience to fill these positions on a timely basis  on favorable terms  or at all 
as a result  the loss of services of mr 
thomas and ms 
thomas could have an adverse effect on our business 
if we are unable to use our established brands such as the people to people name  or if the value of our name  image or brand diminishes  our ability in attracting future travelers could be significantly impacted and our business would be harmed 
our brand names and trademarks are integral to our marketing efforts 
we have registered or applied for a variety of service and trademarks including  but not limited to  the names people to people ambassador programs  people to people student ambassador programs  people to people sports ambassador programs  people to people citizen ambassador programs  people to people leadership programs  bookrags and society for global citizens 
in addition  we have the right  subject to certain exceptions  to use the people to people and discovery education service  trademarks and logos for use in our marketing 
our agreements with people to people international  currently scheduled to expire in  give us the exclusive right to develop and conduct programs for grade school through high school students using the people to people name  and the non exclusive right to develop and conduct programs for professionals  college students and athletes using the people to people name 
if our agreement with people to people international were terminated or if we were unable to use the branded name to market new programs or destinations  this could have a material adverse effect on our ability to acquire participants for our programs and consequently affect our results of operations 
similarly  if our relationship with people to people international is disrupted or is adversely impacted because people to people international experiences interruption  delay or ceases operations in the future for any reason  our business could be harmed 
in addition  our ability to attract and enroll new delegates to travel with us is dependent on the value of the brands we associate with and our reputation with potential customers 
if negative news coverage or other negative public relation matters occur in the student travel industry or specifically related to our company  our business could experience adverse effects impacting our volume and profitability 

table of contents the travel industry and specifically the educational segment within the travel industry are highly competitive 
if we are unable to compete effectively in these markets  our financial condition and results of operations could be affected 
the travel industry in general and the educational segment of the travel industry are highly competitive and have relatively low barriers to entry 
we compete with other companies that provide similar educational travel programs  professional travel and adult continuing education programs  activity camps and summer camps  as well as independent programs organized and sponsored by local teachers with the assistance of local travel agents 
people to people  under the terms of its agreement with us  reserves the right to offer programs to college students for studies abroad and to grant to other individuals or entities the right to use the people to people name in connection with people to people s professional education and sports programs 
in the event companies with similar operations to us are granted the right to use the people to people name  our operations and competitive position in the industry could be significantly and adversely impacted 
certain organizations engaged in the travel business could have substantially greater brand name recognition and financial  marketing and sales resources than we do  and may offer an educational travel experience at a lower price 
there can be no assurance that our present or future competitors will not exert significant competitive pressures on us in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
our dependence on travel suppliers could delay the delivery of our products and services  which would impact our reputation and could reduce our profitability 
we are dependent upon travel suppliers for access to their products and services 
travel suppliers include airlines  hotels  bus lines  overseas coordinators and other participants in the travel industry 
consistent with industry practices  we currently have no long term agreements with travel suppliers that obligate such suppliers to sell services or products through us on an ongoing basis 
therefore  the travel suppliers generally can cancel or modify their agreements with us upon relatively short notice 
in addition  any decline in the quality of travel products and services provided by these suppliers  or a perception by our participants of such a decline  could adversely affect our reputation and profitability 
in addition  the loss of contracts  changes in our pricing agreements or commission arrangements  more restricted access to travel suppliers products and services  less favorable public opinion of certain travel suppliers  or loss of deposits with travel suppliers that could go bankrupt  could all have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect the amount we pay for services received from foreign vendors and could positively or negatively affect our gross margin results 
the majority of our travel programs are internationally based and many of our arrangements with our foreign based suppliers require payment to be made in foreign currencies 
increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar in relation to foreign currencies have the effect of impacting the cost of the services to be provided 
we generally enter into forward contracts and other financial instruments with less than two years maturity to help manage program costs and hedge against foreign currency valuation changes 
while the ability to utilize forward contracts for the delivery of foreign currencies can mitigate the effect on program costs and foreign currency exchange fluctuations  there can be no assurance that program costs will not be significantly impacted in future periods 
there can also be no assurance our hedging strategy will mitigate longer term foreign exchange valuation trends 
depending on the strength of the us dollar at the time the forward contracts or other financial instruments are entered into  its strength throughout the contracted period  and the accuracy of our projected enrollment volume  we could experience over hedged positions  which may result in a gain or loss that must be recognized immediately in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents we are exposed to impairment risk of goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets 
financial and credit market volatility directly impacts fair value measurement through our company s estimated weighted average cost of capital used to determine discount rate  and through our common stock price that is used to determine market capitalization 
during times of volatility  significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit or stock price changes are a short term swing or a longer term trend 
the assessment for possible impairment requires us to make judgments including estimating future cash flows that are dependent upon internal forecasts  estimating the long term rate of growth for our business  and estimating the useful life over which our cash flows will occur 
while we have not previously recorded any impairment losses for goodwill or intangible assets  continued adverse market conditions could impact the fair value of our reporting units that could result in impairments of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets 
changes in our estimates and assumptions as they relate to valuation of goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets could affect  potentially materially  our financial condition or results of operations in the future 
the online research and advertising market is intensely competitive and changes rapidly 
if we are unable to project trends and develop new sales opportunities to effectively compete in this space  our ability to maintain historical growth trends could be impacted 
we face significant competition from a wide variety of content and media web properties with companies throughout the world 
the internet content and advertising industry is intensely competitive and has been rapidly evolving with converging technologies 
we compete with many larger web properties that have larger staff dedicated towards selling and advertising and have more traffic to offer potential advertisers 
we believe that the internet offers a more attractive and measurable advertising option than traditional off line media including television  radio  billboard  magazine  and newspaper  and anticipate that this competition will increase over time as online usage continues to grow 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully  and the failure to compete successfully may have a significant adverse effect on our ability for future growth as well as on our results of operations and future cash flows 
litigation or other claims of liability may subject us to significant costs  judgments  fines and penalties that may not be covered by or may be in excess of available insurance coverage  may divert management s attention and resources from our business  and may result in adverse publicity 
due to the nature of our business and being a publicly held company  we may be subject to liability claims arising out of perceived wrong doing related to management s decisions  securities claims  governmental investigations  business operations  accidents or disasters causing injury to delegates on our programs  including claims for serious personal injury or death 
we maintain adequate liability insurance coverage for risks arising from the normal course of our business  including  but not limited to  professional and general liability insurance 
there is no assurance that the insurance maintained by us will be sufficient to cover one or more large claims  that such insurance will cover a claim or loss  continue to be available in the future  or that the applicable insurer will be solvent at the time of any covered loss 
further  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain insurance coverage at acceptable levels and cost in the future 
successful assertion against us of one or a series of large uninsured claims  or of one or a series of claims exceeding any insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and cash flows 
in addition to impact on profitability  liability claims asserted against us can also divert management s attention and company resources to participation in the litigation process and defense of these asserted claims 
lastly  claims asserted against us could adversely affect the public s perception of us 
see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for a description of the recent claims that have been made against us 
government regulation and taxation may adversely affect the travel industry generally and or our business specifically and thus increases our operating expenses 
many travel suppliers  particularly airlines  are subject to extensive regulation by federal  state and foreign governments 
in addition  the travel industry is subject to certain seller of travel laws and special taxes by federal  state  local and foreign governments  including but not limited to hotel bed taxes  car rental taxes  airline excise taxes  airport taxes and fees and income and business taxes 
new or different regulatory schemes  increasing regulatory scrutiny on third party marketing and licensing arrangements  more rigorous privacy laws  or changes in tax policy could have an adverse impact on key parts of our business or the travel industry in general and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

table of contents significant fluctuations in financial results from quarter to quarter related to the seasonality of our business and the timing differences of marketing expenses as compared to corresponding revenue could impact investor confidence and cause potential share price volatility 
our business is highly seasonal and we anticipate that this trend will continue for the foreseeable future 
the majority of our travel programs and the associated revenues are delivered in june and july of each year 
a small number of travel programs are delivered throughout the rest of the year as well as the majority of our internet research and advertising sales that occur primarily during the traditional school year 
sales and marketing costs are highest in the third and fourth quarters and typically occur nine to twelve months in advance of the associated revenue  mostly recognized during the second and third quarters 
although historically revenue recognized has offset the operating losses incurred during the rest of the year  the long lead time for this revenue  creates a situation where individual quarter or annual operating results may not match expectations of public market analysts and investors 
depending on their understanding of this aspect of our business  history with our company  and confidence in forthcoming business plans  our share price could be materially and adversely affected 
the market price of our common stock could also be subject to significant fluctuations due to specific market changes  such as speculation in the press or investment community  actions by institutional shareholders  general market conditions  and limited shares of common stock available for trading 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  we may lose a competitive advantage or incur substantial litigation costs to protect our rights 
substantially all of our publications in the bookrags segment are protected by copyright  held either in our name  in the name of the author of the work  or in the name of the sponsoring professional society 
such copyrights protect our exclusive right to publish the work in the united states and in many countries abroad for specified periods 
our ability to obtain and continue to obtain access to existing and new content  as well as our ability to continue to achieve expected results depends  in part  upon our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 
our results may be adversely affected by lack of adequate legal or technological protections for our intellectual property in some jurisdictions and markets that we operate in 
we are exposed to concentration of credit risk that could affect our results of operations 
a large percentage of our balance sheet consists of cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities which are exposed to concentrations of credit risk 
although we place our cash and temporary cash investments with high credit quality institutions  at times  such balances may be in excess of the federal depository insurance limit or may be on deposit at institutions which are not covered by this insurance 
if such institutions were to become insolvent while holding our cash  cash equivalents or available for sale securities in excess of the insurance limit  we could suffer losses or it could be necessary to obtain credit financing to operate our travel programs 
there is no assurance that we could respond timely enough to avoid losses and a swift  material change in these markets could have an adverse effect on our cash flow 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue paying dividends at the current rate 
based on current circumstances  we plan to continue our current dividend practices 
however  you should be aware that these practices are subject to change due to a variety of factors  including the following i we may not have enough cash to pay such dividends due to changes in our cash requirements  capital spending plans  cash flows or financial position  ii decisions on whether  when and in which amounts to make any future distributions will remain at all times entirely at the discretion of our board of directors  which reserves the right to change our dividend practices at any time and for any reason  iii the effects of changes to laws or regulations which impact our ability to pay dividends  iv the amount of dividends that we may distribute to our stockholders may be limited by the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur  and v the effects of downturns in the domestic and global economies 
our stockholders should be aware that they have no contractual or other legal right to dividends 
if we do not pay dividends  our common stock may be less valuable because a return on an investment in our common stock will only occur if our stock price appreciates 

table of contents failure to comply with the applicable rules and regulatory standards or maintain the security of internal or customer data  including payment card industry pci data  could adversely affect our reputation and subject us to substantial fines and penalties 
our businesses require collection and retention of large volumes of internal and customer data  including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information of our customers  that are processed  summarized and reported by our various information systems and those of our service providers 
we also maintain personally identifiable information about our employees 
the integrity and protection of all customer  employee  and company data is critical to us 
we devote substantial time and incur additional costs to ensure proper compliance and safe guarding of such data 
our customers and employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal information  and comply with the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy which is increasingly demanding 
a theft  loss or fraudulent use of customer personal or credit card information  employee  or company data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant remedial and other costs  fines and litigation 
we could be negatively impacted by a security breach  through cyber attack  cyber intrusion or otherwise 
we face the risk of a security breach  whether through cyber attack or cyber intrusion over the internet  malware  computer viruses  attachments to e mails  persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization  or other significant disruption of our it networks and related systems 
although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of information and it networks and related systems  and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption  there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging 
a security breach or other significant disruption involving our it networks and related systems could disrupt the proper functioning of these networks and systems and therefore our operations  result in the unauthorized access to  and destruction  loss  theft  misappropriation or release of proprietary  confidential  sensitive or otherwise valuable information  which others could use to compete against us  require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result  subject us to claims for contract breach and damages  or damage our reputation  any or all of which could have a negative impact on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
our business could be negatively affected as a result the actions of activist shareholders or other proxy related matters 
we face the risk that one of our stockholders could seek to have its own director candidates elected at our annual meeting of stockholders and a proxy contest could ensue  which could adversely affect our business because responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can disrupt our operations  be costly and time consuming  and divert the attention of our management and employees  perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities  and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners  and if individuals are elected to our board of directors with a specific agenda  it may adversely affect our ability to effectively implement our business strategy and create additional value for our stockholders
