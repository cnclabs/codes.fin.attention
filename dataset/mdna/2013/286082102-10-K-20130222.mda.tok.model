overview key financial results for were as follows our results for the year ended december  reflect revenue growth  reduced operating expenses as a percentage of revenue  significant tax benefits  and improved profitability despite a decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue 
our revenue growth was primarily driven by the strength of our industrial inkjet operating segment and the benefits of the acquisition strategy in our productivity software operating segment  partially offset by delayed new product launches by the leading printer manufacturers in our fiery operating segment and weakness in the european economy 
we completed our acquisitions of cretaprint  metrics  ops  and technique in we completed our acquisitions of streamline  entrac  prism  and alphagraph in we completed our acquisition of radius in their results are included in our results of operations subsequent to their respective acquisition dates 
our consolidated revenue increased by approximately  or million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  consisting of increased industrial inkjet and productivity software revenue of and million  respectively  partially offset by decreased fiery revenue of million 
industrial inkjet revenue increased by primarily due to the acquisition of cretaprint  which closed during the first quarter of enabling our entry into the ceramic tile decoration market  and increased sales of super wide and wide format uv printers and uv ink 
we continue to experience growth resulting from the ongoing analog to digital and solvent to uv migration  strong demand for our gslx uv curing digital inkjet printer incorporating cool cure led technology  which was launched in  and acceptance of the qspro and qspro uv hybrid digital inkjet printers  which were launched in productivity software revenue increased by primarily due to our acquisition strategy in the productivity software operating segment  as well as increased revenue from monarch and pace products and professional services 
productivity software revenue benefited from our acquisition of prism  which closed during the third quarter of  alphagraph  which closed during the fourth quarter of  metrics  which closed during the second quarter of  and ops and technique  which closed during the fourth quarter of the acquisitions of ops  technique  prism  alphagraph  and radius have increased the international presence of our productivity software business and  specifically  the acquisition of metrics has increased our latin american presence 
our acquisitions have significantly increased our recurring maintenance revenue base 
fiery revenue decreased by primarily due to delayed new product launches by printer manufacturers  as well as the slow down in the european economy 
although end customer and reseller channel preference for fiery products drives demand  most fiery revenue relies on printer manufacturers to design  develop  and integrate fiery technology into their print engines 

table of contents the gross profit percentage decreased by percentage points from in to in  primarily due to the change in mix between our operating segments 
our lower margin industrial inkjet operating segment revenue increased from of consolidated revenue during the year ended december  to of consolidated revenue during the year ended december  meanwhile  our higher margin fiery operating segment revenue decreased from of consolidated revenue during the year ended december  to of consolidated revenue during the year ended december  the unfavorable impact of the change in mix was partially offset by our improved gross profit percentage in the industrial inkjet and productivity software segments 
operating expenses as a percent of revenue decreased from in to in operating expenses increased by million between and  but decreased as a percentage of revenue due to the increase in revenue during the corresponding periods 
the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by head count increases related to our business acquisitions  commission payments resulting from increased revenue  and increased trade show spending due to drupa  which is a european trade show that is held once every four years  partially offset by targeted head count reductions undertaken to lower our quarterly operating expense run rate in the fiery and productivity software operating segments 
interest and other income expense  net  decreased by million from a gain of million in to a gain of in this decrease is primarily due to the million gain on sale of a minority interest in a privately held company in the prior year  imputed interest expense of million related to the sale of building and land  and million decrease in interest income due to lower cash equivalent and investment balances earlier in  partially offset by a foreign currency fluctuation of million between the periods 
this foreign currency fluctuation was the result of a million foreign exchange gain resulting from the revaluation of our foreign currency denominated net assets mainly denominated in euros  british pounds sterling  brazilian reais  and indian rupees compared with a million foreign exchange loss in the prior year 
we recorded a tax benefit of million in on pre tax income of million compared to a tax provision of million in on pre tax income of million primarily due the million benefit related to the capital loss from the liquidation of a wholly owned subsidiary and the million benefit related to the operational restructuring in spain 
in  we also recognized million of previously unrecognized tax benefits as compared to million in the increased tax benefit in was partially offset by the impact of the increase in pre tax operating income in

the million increase in compared with consisted of increased industrial inkjet  productivity software  and fiery revenue of   and million  respectively 
industrial inkjet revenue industrial inkjet revenue increased by million  or  in compared with primarily due to the acquisition of cretaprint  which closed during the first quarter of enabling our entry into the ceramic tile decoration market  and increased sales of super wide and wide format uv printers and uv ink 
we continue to experience growth resulting from the ongoing analog to digital and solvent to uv migration 
our revenue benefited from strong demand for our gslx uv curing digital inkjet printer incorporating cool cure led technology  which was launched in  and acceptance of our qspro and qspro super wide format uv hybrid digital inkjet printers  which were launched in the qspro and qspro printers were re designed based on gs technology to replace the qs product line  thereby resulting in numerous operational efficiencies including interchangeability of components and consistent technology between the gs and qs product lines 
uv ink revenue increased as a result of the high utilization that our uv printers are experiencing in the field  partially offset by decreased solvent printer installed base demand measured by solvent ink usage 
industrial inkjet revenue increased by million  or  in compared with  across all of our industrial inkjet product lines encompassing increased printer  digital uv ink  and service part sales 
we 
table of contents continued to extend the gs product family in and with led technology on our hybrid gs  as well as a gs roll to roll version 
in addition  we launched new printing solutions including textile and entry level production uv hybrid printers 
productivity software revenue productivity software revenue increased by million  or  in compared with  primarily due to our acquisition strategy in the productivity software operating segment  as well as increased revenue from monarch and pace products and professional services 
productivity software revenue benefited from our acquisition of prism  which closed during the third quarter of  our acquisition of alphagraph  which closed during the fourth quarter of  our acquisition of metrics  which closed during the second quarter of  and our acquisitions of ops and technique  which closed during the fourth quarter of  as well as increased revenue from monarch and pace products and professional services 
the acquisitions of ops  technique  prism  alphagraph  and radius have increased the international presence of our productivity software business and  specifically  the acquisition of metrics has increased our latin american presence 
our acquisitions have significantly increased our recurring maintenance revenue base 
the economic downturn has benefited this operating segment  which focuses on the automation of printing business functions thereby improving productivity and cost reduction by our customers 
productivity software revenue increased by million  or  in compared with  primarily due to internally generated revenue increases with respect to the pace  monarch  radius  and web to print products 
productivity software revenue benefited from our acquisition of prism  which closed during the third quarter of and to a lesser extent  our acquisitions of streamline and alphagraph  which closed during the first and fourth quarters of  respectively 
productivity software recurring revenue includes subscription revenue and maintenance fees 
fiery revenue fiery revenue decreased by million  or  in compared with although end customer and reseller channel preference for fiery products drives demand  most fiery revenue relies on printer manufacturers to design  develop  and integrate fiery technology into their print engines 
the fiery revenue decline is primarily due to delayed new product launches by these printer manufacturers as well as the slowdown in the european economy 
fiery revenue increased by million  or  in compared with the fiery operating segment experienced strong demand in for current products from the leading printer manufacturers and increased revenue from stand alone and embedded servers and proofing software 
fiery revenue benefited to a lesser extent from the entrac business acquisition  which closed during the third quarter of revenue by geographic area our revenue by geographic area for the years ended december    and was as follows in thousands for the years ended december  change over over americas emea apac japan rest of world row total revenue 
table of contents compared with our consolidated revenue increase of million  or  in compared with  resulted from increased revenue in the americas  emea  and row  partially offset by decreased revenue in japan 
americas revenue increased by in compared with  primarily due to increased industrial inkjet and productivity software revenue  partially offset by decreased fiery revenue as follows industrial inkjet revenue increased primarily due to sales of super wide and wide format uv printers and uv ink 
productivity software revenue increased in the americas primarily due to revenue realized from our acquisitions of streamline and prism  as well as increased monarch  pace  and radius revenue 
fiery revenue decreased primarily as a consequence of delayed product launches by the leading printer manufacturers 
emea revenue increased by in compared with primarily due to increased industrial inkjet revenue resulting from increased label and packaging digital uv printer revenue  uv ink revenue  and the acquisition of cretaprint  which closed during the first quarter of  and increased productivity software revenue primarily due to our acquisitions of prism and alphagraph  supported by increased radius revenue  partially offset by decreased fiery revenue 
japan revenue decreased by in compared with primarily due to decreased fiery revenue resulting from the slow economy in japan and delayed product launches by the leading printer manufacturers 
row revenue increased by in compared with primarily due to the cretaprint acquisition  which closed during the first quarter of  our acquisition of prism  which closed during the third quarter of  and our acquisition of metrics  which closed during the second quarter of the shift of the ceramic tile industry from southern europe eg  spain and italy to the emerging markets china  india  brazil  and indonesia has accelerated revenue growth in this geographic region 
compared with our consolidated revenue increase of million  or  in compared with  resulted from double digit percentage growth in americas  emea  and row resulting from increased revenue in all three operating segments  partially offset by decreased revenue in japan 
the and fiery and industrial inkjet product launches mitigated the impact of the weak economic environment in the operating segment geographic breakdown in remained comparable to with the exception of the decrease in japan 
americas revenue increased by million  or  in compared with americas revenue increased due to double digit percentage revenue increases in all three of our operating segments 
emea revenue increased by million  or  in compared with  due to double digit percentage revenue growth in all three of our operating segments 
industrial inkjet revenue growth was primarily driven by increased sales of our super wide format printers  digital uv ink  and parts 
our productivity software customer base has increased significantly as a result of the alphagraph and prism acquisitions and benefited from an expanded international sales force acquired with the alphagraph  prism  and radius acquisitions 

table of contents fiery revenue increased due to strong demand for current products from the leading printer manufacturers and increased revenue from stand alone and embedded servers and proofing software 
japan revenue decreased by million  or  in compared with  primarily due to decreased industrial inkjet and fiery revenue resulting from the poor economy in japan and delayed sales and supply constraints resulting from the march earthquake and tsunami 
row revenue increased by million  or  in compared with  primarily due to increased demand for industrial inkjet and fiery products in china and the rest of asia 
we have expanded our international sales force as a result of the alphagraph  prism  and radius acquisitions 
revenue by geographic area by operating segment in compared with industrial inkjet revenue represented    and of revenue in the americas  emea  japan  and row  respectively  compared with    and of revenue 
productivity software revenue represented    and of revenue in the americas  emea  japan  and row  respectively  compared with    and of revenue 
fiery revenue represented    and of revenue in the americas  emea  japan  and row  respectively  compared with    and of revenue 
shipments to some of our significant printer manufacturer customers are made to centralized purchasing and manufacturing locations  which in turn ship to other locations  making it difficult to obtain accurate geographical shipment data 
accordingly  we believe that export sales of our products into each region may differ from what is reported 
we expect that sales outside of the us will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue 
although end customer and reseller channel preference for fiery products drives demand  most fiery revenue relies on printer manufacturers to design  develop  and integrate fiery technology into their print engines 
a significant portion of our revenue is  and has been  generated by sales of our fiery printer and copier related products to a relatively small number of leading printer manufacturers 
the printer manufacturers act as distributors and sell fiery products to end customers through reseller channels 
xerox provided of our revenue for the year ended december  xerox and ricoh each provided more than of our revenue individually and together accounted for of our revenue for the year ended december  xerox and canon each contributed over of our revenue and together accounted for approximately of our revenue for the year ended december  no assurance can be given that our relationships with these and other printer manufacturers will continue or that we will successfully increase the number of printer manufacturing customers or the size of our existing relationships 
we expect that if we continue to increase our revenue in the industrial inkjet and productivity software operating segments  the percentage of our revenue from printer manufacturing customers will decrease 
our reliance on revenue from the leading printer manufacturers decreased significantly during due to the change in mix between our operating segments 
in  of our revenue was from other sources as compared with from other sources in and over time  we expect our revenue from the leading printer manufacturers to continue to decline 
because sales of our printer and copier related products constitute a significant portion of our revenue and there are a limited number of printer manufacturers producing copiers and printers in sufficient volume to be attractive customers for us  we expect that we will continue to depend on a relatively small number of printer manufacturers for a significant portion of our fiery controller revenue in future periods 
accordingly  if we lose or experience reduced sales to one of these printer manufacturer distributors  we will have difficulty replacing that revenue with sales to new or existing customers and our fiery revenue will likely decline significantly 

table of contents we intend to continue to develop new products and technologies for each of our product lines including new generations of super wide and wide format printers  ceramic tile decoration  server and controller products  and other new product lines  and to distribute those new products to or through current and new printer manufacturers  distributors  and end users in and beyond 
no assurance can be given that the introduction or market acceptance of current or future products will be successful 
if sales of our products do not grow over time in absolute terms  or if we are not able to meet demand for higher unit volumes  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
there can be no assurance that products that we introduce in the future will successfully compete  be accepted by the market  or otherwise effectively replace the volume of revenue and or income from our older products 
market acceptance of our software products  products acquired through acquisitions  and other products cannot be assured 
in addition  we may experience potential loss of sales  unexpected costs  or adverse impact on relationships with customers or suppliers as a result of acquisitions 
in addition to the factors described above  price reductions for our products will affect revenue in the future 
we have previously reduced  and in the future will likely change  prices for our products 
depending on the price elasticity of demand for our products  the pricing and quality of competitive products  and other economic and competitive conditions  price changes have had  and may in the future have  an adverse impact on our revenue and profits 
gross profit gross profit by operating segment  excluding stock based compensation  for the years ended december    and was as follows in thousands for the years ended december  industrial inkjet revenue gross profit gross profit percentages productivity software revenue gross profit gross profit percentages fiery revenue gross profit gross profit percentages a reconciliation of operating segment gross profit to the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december    and is as follows in thousands for the years ended december  segment gross profit stock based compensation expense gross profit overview our gross profit percentages were   and for the years ended   and  respectively 
our gross profit percentage decreased by percentage points in  as compared with  
table of contents primarily due to the change in mix between our operating segments 
our lower margin industrial inkjet operating segment revenue increased from of consolidated revenue during the year ended december  to of consolidated revenue during the year ended december  meanwhile  our higher margin fiery operating segment revenue decreased from of consolidated revenue during the year ended december  to of consolidated revenue during the year ended december  the unfavorable impact of the change in mix was partially offset by our improved gross profit percentage in the industrial inkjet and productivity software operating segment 
our gross profit percentage improved by percentage points in  as compared with  primarily due to a percentage point increase in the industrial inkjet gross profit percentage  a percentage point increase in the productivity software gross profit percentage  and increased fiery revenue 
industrial inkjet gross profit the industrial inkjet gross profit percentage increased from in to in primarily due to targeted cost reduction initiatives  achieving post acquisition cost synergies in the cretaprint business  fixed manufacturing costs being spread over higher industrial inkjet revenue  higher selling prices for new products  favorable product mix shift toward higher margin printers  and reduced warranty exposure  partially offset by expenses related to engineering design modifications to improve quality 
the industrial inkjet gross profit percentage increased from in to in the improvement in the industrial inkjet gross profit percentage compared with the prior year is primarily due to fixed manufacturing costs being spread over higher industrial inkjet revenue and reduced warranty exposure  which resulted from improved product performance  partially offset by engineering design modifications to improve quality 
the industrial inkjet gross profit percentage also increased due to the million write off of excess solvent inventories and related end of life purchases during  as a result of the accelerating transition from solvent to uv technology 
productivity software gross profit the increase in the productivity software gross profit percentage from in to in was primarily due to efficiencies gained through increased revenue and the achievement of certain post acquisition cost synergies 
the increase in productivity software revenue aided the gross profit percentage due to the fixed component included within the productivity software cost of revenue 
the increase in the productivity software gross profit percentage from in to in was primarily due to efficiencies gained through increased revenue 
productivity software revenue increased from of total revenue in to of total revenue in fiery gross profit the fiery gross profit percentage of in was comparable to in primarily due to comparable product mix and stable pricing 
the fiery gross profit percentage of in was comparable to in the increase in fiery revenue dollars aided the consolidated gross profit percentage due to the fixed component included within the fiery cost of revenue 
if our product mix changes significantly  our gross profit will fluctuate 
in addition  gross profit can be impacted by a variety of other factors 
these factors include market prices achieved on our current and future products  availability and pricing of key components including memory subsystems  processors  and print heads  subcontractor manufacturing costs  product mix  distribution channel  geographic mix  product transition results  new product introductions  competition  business acquisitions  and general economic conditions in the us and 
table of contents abroad 
consequently  gross profit may fluctuate from period to period 
in addition  if we reduce prices  gross profit could be lower 
many of our products and sub assemblies are manufactured by subcontract manufacturers that purchase most of the necessary components 
if our subcontract manufacturers cannot obtain necessary components at favorable prices  we could experience increased product costs 
we purchase certain components directly  including processors  memory subsystems  certain asics  and software licensed from various sources  including adobe postscript software

stock based compensation stock based compensation expense for the years ended december    and were million  or of revenue  million  or of revenue  and million  or of revenue  respectively 
we account for stock based payment awards in accordance with asc  stock compensation  which requires stock based compensation expense to be recognized based on the fair value of such awards on the date of grant 
we amortize compensation cost on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period  after assessing the probability of achieving requisite performance criteria with respect to performance based awards 
stock based compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award as though the award were  in substance  multiple awards 
this has the impact of greater stock based compensation expense during the initial years of the vesting period 

table of contents stock based compensation expense decreased million  or  in as compared with due to fluctuations in the number of awards granted between the periods and a true up of estimated forfeitures 
stock based compensation expense increased million  or  in as compared with due to new equity awards granted with relatively higher fair value driven by the increase in the trading price of our stock and a true up of estimated forfeitures

deferred proceeds from property transaction on november   we sold the  square foot building located at velocity way in foster city  california  which serves as our corporate headquarters  along with approximately four acres of land and certain other assets related to the property  to gilead for million 
we will continue to use the facility for up to one year for which rent is not required to be paid 
we are accounting for this transaction as a financing transaction related to our continued use of the facility and a sublease receivable relative to gilead s use of a portion of the facility 
our use of the facility during the rent free period constitutes a form of continuing involvement that prevents gain recognition 
we will record interest expense on the financing obligation at our incremental borrowing rate and increase the financing obligation by the same amount 
at the same time  we will record sublease income at an implied market rate from gilead and record a sublease receivable for the same amount 
at that point  we will have no continuing involvement with the property and we will account for the transaction as a property sale  thereby recognizing a gain of approximately million on the sale of the property  which represents the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying value of the property and related assets as well as any direct incremental costs associated with the sale 
the assets subject to this sale of million as of december   include land  building  and improvements of million  and current assets of million 
the sold assets include the million facility  million of related land  and million of leasehold and land improvements  net of accumulated depreciation of million 
current assets include million of direct transaction costs  million of previously capitalized lease financing and other costs  and an imputed sublease receivable of million 
goodwill impairment we perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of each year according to the provisions of asc  goodwill subsequent measurement 
a two step impairment test of goodwill is required 
in the first step  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the fair value 
table of contents exceeds carrying value  goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required 
if the carrying value exceeds fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is required to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit  excluding goodwill  from the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in the first step 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then an impairment loss must be recorded equal to the difference 
our goodwill valuation analysis is based on our respective reporting units industrial inkjet  productivity software  and fiery  which are consistent with our operating segments identified in note segment information  geographic data  and major customers of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we determined the fair value of our reporting units as of december  by equally weighting the market and income approaches 
under the market approach  we estimated fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings of comparable companies 
under the income approach  we estimated fair value based on a projected cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
based on our valuation results  we have determined that the fair values of our reporting units exceed their carrying values 
industrial inkjet  productivity software  and fiery fair values are   and million  respectively  which exceed carrying value by   and  respectively 
since fair values were determined using a weighting of the market and income approaches  we reviewed the sensitivity of the market multiple and discount rate to evaluate the sensitivity of the industrial inkjet  productivity software  and fiery valuations 
the impact of a change in the market multiple of results in either an increase or decrease in industrial inkjet  productivity software  and fiery fair values of 
likewise  the impact of a change in the discount rate of one percentage point results in either an increase in the industrial inkjet  productivity software  and fiery fair values of   or  respectively  or a decrease of   or  respectively 
consequently  we have concluded that no reasonably possible changes would reduce the fair value of the reporting units to such a level that it would cause a failure in step one of the impairment analysis 
long lived asset impairment we evaluate potential impairment with respect to long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we recognized long lived asset impairment charges of million for the year ended december   consisting primarily of assets impaired related to an industrial inkjet facility closure and the impairment of the remaining book value of our equity method investees 
no asset impairment charges were recognized during the years ended december  and other investments  included within other assets  consist of equity and debt investments in privately held companies that develop products  markets  and services that are strategic to us 
in substance common stock investments in which we exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies  but do not have a majority voting interest  are accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
investments not meeting these requirements are accounted for using the cost method of accounting 
we previously assessed each investment s technology pipeline and market conditions in the industry and determined it is no longer probable that they will generate sufficient positive future cash flows to recover the full carrying amount of the investment 
as such  we recognized an impairment charge of million in during the second quarter of  we further assessed each remaining investment s ability to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment in accordance with asc  investments equity method and joint ventures subsequent measurement 
based on this assessment  we impaired the remaining carrying value of these investments of million 
in september  we received proceeds from the sale of one of these investments of million

provision for benefit from income taxes we recorded a tax benefit of million in on pre tax income of million  compared to a tax provision of million in on pre tax income of million  and a tax benefit of million in on a pre tax loss of million

primary differences between our recorded tax provision benefit rate and the us statutory rate of include tax benefits related to credits for research and development costs  lower taxes on permanently reinvested foreign earnings  and the tax effects of stock based compensation expense pursuant to asc  stock compensation income taxes  which are non deductible for tax purposes 
on january   the american taxpayer relief act of was signed  renewing the federal research and development credit retroactive to january  in accordance with asc  income taxes  requires that the effects of a change in tax law or rates be recognized in the period

one of the effects of this reorganization  in combination with other factors  was the recognition of a combined million federal and state tax benefit due to the realization of capital loss deductions related to the difference between a portion of our original acquisition price of vutek  inc  and its current fair market value 
in  we recorded an impairment charge related to the decreased value of our inkjet reporting unit for financial reporting purposes  which included vutek  inc  for which a limited tax benefit was recognized given the legal form of our original acquisition of vutek  inc and the nature of the impairment 
as a result of the sale of our foster city corporate headquarters building and related land in  we recognized taxable income of approximately million and have recorded a deferred tax asset of million 
while this gain is required to be reported in for income tax purposes it was also required to be deferred under gaap until we vacate the building 
we anticipate the reversal of this deferred tax asset in our fourth quarter of in the fourth quarter of  we entered into a business reorganization which merged our two operating subsidiaries in spain into one operating unit 
in addition to achieving operational synergies  one of the effects of this reorganization was the recognition of a tax benefit of million related to an increase in the value of intangible assets for spanish statutory and tax reporting purposes 

table of contents we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the us  which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions 
most of this income is earned in the netherlands  spain  and the cayman islands  which are jurisdictions with tax rates materially lower than the statutory us tax rate of 
subsequent to the acquisition of cretaprint in january  we realigned the ownership of its intellectual property to parallel efi s worldwide intellectual property ownership 
our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly and be adversely impacted if anticipated earnings in the netherlands  spain  and the cayman islands are proportionally lower than current projections and earnings in all other jurisdictions are proportionally higher than current projections 
while we currently do not foresee a need to repatriate the earnings of these operations  should we require more capital in the us than is generated by our us operations  we may elect to repatriate funds held in our foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the us through debt or equity issuances 
these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates  the cash payment of taxes  and or increased interest expense 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income by considering both positive and negative evidence relating to their recoverability 
if we believe that recovery of these deferred tax assets is not more likely than not  we establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we increase a valuation allowance  we will include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such determination is made 
significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we considered all available evidence  including recent operating results  projections of future taxable income  our ability to utilize loss and credit carryforwards  and the feasibility of tax planning strategies 
a significant piece of objective positive evidence evaluated was cumulative pre tax income during the three years ended december  in addition  we considered that loss and credit carryforwards have not expired unused and a majority of our loss and credit carryforwards will not expire prior to finally  we considered that our results from operations have improved each year since as a result of this evaluation  we have determined that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit related to our deferred tax assets  except for a valuation allowance on foreign tax credits resulting from the acquisition of best gmbh and compensation deductions potentially limited by us internal revenue code irc m 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable could be negatively impacted if sufficient taxable income is not generated in the carryforward period 
unaudited non gaap financial information use of non gaap financial information to supplement our consolidated financial results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we use non gaap measures of net income and earnings per diluted share that are gaap net income and gaap earnings per diluted share adjusted to exclude certain recurring and non recurring costs  expenses  and gains 
we believe that the presentation of non gaap net income and non gaap earnings per diluted share provides important supplemental information regarding non cash expenses and significant recurring and non recurring items that we believe are important to understanding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations 
non gaap net income and non gaap earnings per diluted share are among the primary indicators used by management as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods and by management and our board of directors to determine whether our operating performance has met specified targets and thresholds 
management uses non gaap net income and non gaap earnings per diluted share when evaluating operating performance because it believes the exclusion of the items described below  for which the amounts and or timing may vary significantly depending on the company s activities and other factors  
table of contents facilitates comparability of the company s operating performance from period to period 
we have chosen to provide this information to investors so they can analyze our operating results in the same way as management and use this information in their assessment of our business and the valuation of our company 
use and economic substance of non gaap financial measures we compute non gaap net income and non gaap earnings per diluted share by adjusting gaap net income and gaap earnings per diluted share to remove the impact of recurring amortization of acquisition related intangibles and stock based compensation expense  as well as restructuring related and non recurring charges and gains and the tax effect of these adjustments 
such non recurring charges and gains include acquisition related transaction expenses and the costs to integrate such acquisitions into our business  sale of a non strategic minority investment in a privately held company  changes in the fair value of contingent consideration 
end of life solvent inventory purchases and related obsolescence  and asset impairment 
these excluded items are described below recurring charges and gains  including amortization of acquisition related intangibles 
intangible assets acquired to date are being amortized on a straight line basis 
post acquisition non competition agreements are amortized over their term 
stock based compensation expense recognized in accordance with asc non recurring charges and gains  including provision for excess solvent inventories and related end of life purchases resulting from the accelerating transition from solvent based printing to uv curable based printing 
restructuring and other consists of restructuring charges incurred as we consolidate the number and size of our facilities and  as a result  reduce the size of our workforce 
acquisition related executive deferred compensation costs  which are dependent on the continuing employment of a former shareholder of an acquired company  are being amortized on a straight line basis 
expenses incurred to integrate businesses acquired during the periods reported 
acquisition related transaction costs associated with businesses acquired during the periods reported and anticipated transactions 
asset impairment costs consist primarily of equipment and non cancellable purchase orders relating to a facility closure and the impairment of a private minority investment 
changes in fair value of contingent consideration 
our management determined that we should analyze the total return provided by the investment when evaluating operating results of an acquired entity 
the total return consists of operating profit generated from the acquired entity compared to the purchase price paid  including the final amounts paid for contingent consideration without considering any post acquisition adjustments related to the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration 
because management believes the final purchase price paid for the acquisition reflects the accounting value assigned to both contingent consideration and to the intangible assets  we exclude the gaap impact of any adjustments to the fair value of acquisition related contingent consideration from the operating results of an acquisition in subsequent periods 
we believe this approach is useful in understanding the long term return provided by an acquisition and that investors benefit from a supplemental non gaap financial measure that excludes the impact of this adjustment 

table of contents imputed net expenses related to sale of building and land 
on november   we sold our  square foot building located at velocity way in foster city  california  which serves as our corporate headquarters  along with approximately four acres of land and certain other assets related to the property  to gilead for million 
we will continue to use the facility for up to one year for which rent is not required to be paid 
this constitutes a form of continuing involvement that prevents gain recognition 
until we vacate the building  the proceeds from the sale will be recognized as deferred proceeds from property transaction on our consolidated balance sheet  which is currently million  including imputed interest costs 
imputed interest expense and depreciation  net of accrued sublease income of million  has been accrued as of december  gain on sale of minority investment in a privately held company

we settled a dispute with the lessor of a facility in the uk for million in  which was partially offset by the receipt of an additional million in insurance proceeds in  net of legal fees and costs  related to our previously disclosed settlement of the shareholder derivative litigation concerning our historical stock option granting practices 
tax effect of non gaap adjustments as follows after excluding the items described above  we apply the principles of asc  to estimate the non gaap income tax provision in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
we have excluded a million benefit from our non gaap net income for the year ended december  due to a capital loss related to the liquidation of a wholly owned subsidiary 
we have excluded a million benefit from our non gaap net income for the year ended december  related to an increase in value of acquired intangibles for tax purposes due to an operational restructuring in spain 
we have excluded the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits of   and million from our non gaap net income for the years ended december    and  respectively  to facilitate comparability of our operating performance between the years 
these tax benefits primarily arose from the release of previously unrecognized tax benefits resulting from the expiration of us federal and state statutes of limitations 
we recognized a tax benefit of million resulting from the retroactive renewal of the us federal research and development tax credit on january  our tax benefit determined in accordance with gaap is based on tax rates and regulations enacted as of december  consequently  the research and development tax credit did not enter into the determination of our gaap net income for the year ended december  we have excluded interest accrued on prior year tax reserves of   and million from our non gaap net income for the years ended december    and  respectively 
usefulness of non gaap financial information to investors these non gaap measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to gaap and may be materially different from other non gaap measures  including similarly titled non gaap measures  used by other companies 
the presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation from  as a substitute for  or superior to  net income or earnings per diluted share prepared in accordance with gaap 
non gaap financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect certain items that may have a material impact on our reported financial results 
we expect to continue to incur expenses of a nature similar to the non

revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue primarily from product revenue  which includes hardware controllers  design licensed solutions including upgrades  digital industrial inkjet printers including components replaced under maintenance agreements  and ink  software licensing and development  and royalties 
we receive service revenue from software license maintenance agreements  customer support  training  and consulting 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
we recognize revenue on the sale of controllers  printers  and ink in accordance with the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition  and when applicable  asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements 
as such  revenue is generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
products generally must be shipped against written purchase orders 
we use either a binding purchase order or signed contract as evidence of an arrangement 
sales to some of the leading printer manufacturers are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with a binding purchase order 
sales to our resellers are also evidenced by binding purchase orders or signed contracts and do not generally contain rights of return or price protection 
our arrangements generally do not include product acceptance clauses 
when acceptance is required  revenue is recognized when the product is accepted by the customer 
delivery of hardware generally is complete when title and risk of loss is transferred at point of shipment from manufacturing facilities  or when the product is delivered to the customer s local common carrier 
we also sell products and services using sales arrangements with terms resulting in different timing for revenue recognition as follows if the title and or risk of loss is transferred at a location other than our manufacturing facility  revenue is recognized when title and or risk of loss transfers to the customer  per the terms of the agreement  if title is retained until payment is received  revenue is recognized when title is passed upon receipt of payment  if the sales arrangement is classified as an operating lease  revenue is recognized ratably over the lease term  if the sales arrangement is classified as a sales type lease  revenue is recognized upon shipment  if the sales arrangement is a fixed price for performance extending over a long period and our right to receive future payment depends on our future performance in accordance with these agreements  revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method 

table of contents we deferred an immaterial amount of revenue during the years ended december    and because a portion of the customer payment was contingent upon installation 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the terms of the contract or purchase order 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer  the creditworthiness of the customer  customer concentrations  current economic trends and macroeconomic conditions  changes in customer payment terms  the length of time receivables are past due  and significant one time events 
we may not request collateral from our customers  although down payments are generally required from industrial inkjet and productivity software customers as a means to ensure payment 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue when collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
we license our software primarily under perpetual licenses 
revenue from software consists of software licensing  post contract customer support  and professional consulting 
we apply the provisions of asc  software revenue recognition and  if applicable  sab and asc  to all transactions involving the sale of software products and hardware transactions where the software is not incidental 
we enter into contracts to sell our products and services  and  while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions  there are agreements that contain multiple elements or non standard terms and conditions 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and  if so  how the price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the delivered elements have standalone value  uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved  and there are no customer negotiated refund or return rights for the delivered elements 
if the arrangement includes a customer negotiated refund or right of return relative to the delivered item and the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in our control  the delivered element constitutes a separate unit of accounting 
we limit revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services  future performance obligations  or subject to customer specified return or refund privileges 
changes in the allocation of the sales price between elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition  but will not change the total revenue recognized on the contract 
multiple deliverable arrangements we adopted accounting standards update asu  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asc  and asu  certain revenue arrangements that include software elements asc as of the beginning of fiscal for new and materially modified transactions originating after january  asu eliminated the residual method of allocating revenue in multiple deliverable arrangements 
in accordance with asu  we recognize revenue in multiple element arrangements involving tangible products containing software and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality by applying the relative selling price method of allocation 
the selling price for each element is determined using vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the selling price vsoe  when available including post contract customer support  professional services  hosting  and training  or third party evidence of the selling price tpe is used 
if vsoe or tpe are not available  then the best estimate of the selling price besp is used when applying the relative selling price method for each unit of accounting 
when the arrangement includes software and non software elements  revenue is first allocated to the non software and software elements as a group based on their relative selling price in accordance with asc thereafter  the relative selling price allocated to the software elements as a group is further allocated to each unit of accounting in accordance with asc we then defer revenue with respect to the relative selling price that was allocated to any undelivered element 

table of contents we have calculated besp for software licenses and non software deliverables 
we considered several different methods of establishing besp including cost plus a reasonable margin and stand alone selling price of the same or similar products and  if available  targeted rate of return  list price less discount  and company published list prices to identify the most appropriate representation of the estimated selling price of our products 
due to the wide range of pricing offered to our customers  we determined that selling price of the same or similar products  list price less discount  and company published list prices were not appropriate methods to determine besp for our products 
cost plus a reasonable margin and targeted rate of return were eliminated due to the difficulty in determining the cost associated with the intangible elements of each product s cost structure 
as a result  management believes that the best estimate of the selling price of an element is based on the median sales price of deliverables sold in stand alone transactions and or separately priced deliverables contained in bundled arrangements 
elements sold as stand alone transactions and in bundled arrangements during the last three months of and first nine months of were included in the calculation of besp 
when historical data is unavailable to calculate and support the determination of besp on a newly launched or customized product  then besp of similar products is substituted for revenue allocation purposes 
we offer customization for some of our products 
customization does not have a significant impact on the discounting or pricing of our products 
asu determined that tangible products containing software and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality are not required to follow the software revenue recognition guidance in asc as long as the hardware components of the tangible product substantively contribute to its functionality 
in addition  hardware components of a tangible product containing software components shall always be excluded from the guidance in asc non software elements are accounted for in accordance with sab we have not changed our accounting policy with respect to multiple element arrangements that do not include the sale of tangible products 
the residual method requires that multiple element arrangements containing only software elements remain subject to the provisions of asc when several elements  including software licenses  post contract customer support  hosting  and professional services  are sold to a customer through a single contract  the revenue from such multiple element arrangements are allocated to each element using the residual method in accordance with asc revenue is allocated to the support elements and professional service elements of an agreement using vsoe and to the software license elements of the agreement using the residual method 
we have established vsoe for professional services and hosting based on the rates charged to our customers in stand alone orders 
we have also established vsoe for post contract customer support based on substantive renewal rates 
accordingly  software license fees are recognized under the residual method for arrangements in which the software was licensed with maintenance and or professional services  and where the maintenance and professional services were not essential to the functionality of the delivered software 
prior to adoption of asu and  tangible products containing software and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality were subject to the software revenue recognition guidance with respect to multiple element arrangements in asc we have insignificant transactions where tangible and software products are sold together in a bundled arrangement 
subscription arrangements we have subscription arrangements where the customer pays a fixed fee and receives services over a period of time 
we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the service period 
any up front setup fees associated with our subscription arrangements are recognized ratably  generally over one year 
any up front setup fees that are not associated with our subscription arrangements are recognized upon completion 

table of contents leasing arrangements if the sales arrangement is classified as a sales type lease  then revenue is recognized upon shipment 
leases that are not classified as sales type leases are accounted for as an operating lease with revenue recognized ratably over the lease term 
a lease is classified as a sales type lease with revenue recognized upon shipment if the lease is determined to be collectible with no significant uncertainties and if any of the following criteria are satisfied present value of all minimum lease payments is greater than or equal to of the fair value of the equipment at lease inception  noncancellable lease term is greater than or equal to of the economic life of the equipment  bargain purchase option that allows the lessee to purchase the equipment below fair value  or transfer of ownership to the lessee upon termination of the lease 
long term contracts involving substantial customization we previously followed the completed contract method of revenue recognition on long term contracts involving substantial customization 
during the quarter ended september   we established the ability to produce estimates sufficiently dependable to require adoption of the percentage of completion method with respect to certain fixed price contracts 
revenue on certain fixed price contracts where we provide information technology system development and implementation services is recognized over the contract term based on the percentage of development and implementation services that are provided during the period compared with the total estimated development and implementation services to be provided over the entire contract using guidance from asc  revenue recognition construction type and production type contracts 
these services require that we perform significant  extensive  and complex design  development  modification  or implementation activities of our customers systems 
performance will often extend over long periods  and our right to receive future payment depends on our future performance in accordance with these agreements 
the percentage of completion method involves recognizing probable and reasonably estimable revenue using the percentage of services completed based on the current cumulative cost as a percentage of the estimated total cost  using a reasonably consistent profit margin over the period 
due to the long term nature of these projects  developing the estimates of costs often requires significant judgment 
factors that must be considered in estimating the progress of work completed and ultimate cost of the projects include  but are not limited to  the availability of labor and labor productivity  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  and the impact of delayed performance 
if changes occur in delivery  productivity  or other factors used in developing the estimates of costs or revenue  we revise our cost and revenue estimates  which may result in increases or decreases in revenue and costs  and such revisions are reflected in income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision become known 
we recognize losses on long term fixed price contracts in the period that the contractual loss becomes probable and estimable 
we record amounts invoiced to customers in excess of revenue recognized as deferred revenue until the revenue recognition criteria are met 
we record revenue that is earned and recognized in excess of amounts invoiced on fixed price contracts as trade receivables 
deferred revenue deferred revenue represents amounts received in advance for product support contracts  software customer support contracts  consulting and integration projects  or product sales 
product support contracts include standalone product support packages  routine maintenance service contracts  and upgrades or extensions to 
table of contents standard product warranties 
we defer these amounts when we invoice the customer and then generally recognize revenue either ratably over the support contract life  upon performing the related services  in accordance with the percentage of completion method  or in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to ensure that trade receivables are not overstated due to uncollectibility 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns of million  as of december  to ensure that we have established an adequate allowance for doubtful accounts  management analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and macroeconomic conditions  changes in customer payment terms  the length of time receivables are past due  and significant one time events 
we record specific reserves for individual accounts when we become aware of specific customer circumstances  such as bankruptcy filings  deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  or potential unfavorable outcomes from disputes with customers or vendors 
inventory reserves 
management estimates potential future inventory obsolescence and purchase commitments to evaluate the need for inventory reserves 
current economic trends  changes in customer demand  product design changes  product life and demand  and the acceptance of our products are analyzed to evaluate the adequacy of such reserves 
significant management judgment and estimates must be made in connection with establishing inventory allowances and reserves in any accounting period 
material differences may result in changes in the amount and timing of our net income for any period  if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
our inventories were million  net of inventory reserves of million  as of december  warranty reserves 
our industrial inkjet printer and fiery controller products are generally accompanied by a month limited warranty from date of shipment  which covers both parts and labor 
in accordance with asc  loss contingencies  an accrual is established when the warranty liability is estimable and probable based upon historical experience 
a provision for estimated future warranty work is recorded in cost of revenue when revenue is recognized 
the warranty liability is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty estimates 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made in connection with establishing and updating warranty reserves including estimated potential inventory return rates and replacement or repair costs 
material differences may result in changes in the amount and timing of our income for any period  if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
warranty reserves were million as of december  litigation accruals 
we may be involved  from time to time  in a variety of claims  lawsuits  investigations  or proceedings relating to contractual disputes  securities laws  intellectual property rights  employment  or other matters that may arise in the normal course of business 
we assess our potential liability in each of these matters by using the information available to us 
we develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with inside and outside counsel  which involves a subjective analysis of potential results and various combinations of appropriate litigation and settlement strategies 
we accrue estimated losses from contingencies if a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the material assumptions used by management to estimate the required litigation accrual include communication with our external attorneys regarding the expected duration of the lawsuit  the potential outcome of the lawsuit  and the likelihood of settlement  our strategy regarding the lawsuit  deductible amounts under our insurance policies  and past experiences with similar lawsuits 

table of contents litigation is inherently unpredictable  and while we believe that we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us  our financial statements could be materially affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these contingencies or because of the diversion of management s attention and the incurrence of significant expenses 
restructuring reserves 
we have engaged  and may continue to engage  in restructuring actions  which require management to utilize significant estimates related to the timing and the expense for severance and other employee separation costs  realizable values of assets made obsolete  lease cancellation  facility downsizing  and other exit costs 
if actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted 
self insurance reserves 
we are partially self insured for certain losses related to employee medical and dental coverage  excluding employees covered by health maintenance organizations 
we generally have an individual stop loss deductible of thousand per enrollee unless specific exposures are separately insured 
we have accrued a contingent liability of and million as of december  and  respectively  which is not discounted 
significant management judgment is required to evaluate historical trends  our claims experience  industry claims experience  and related actuarial analyses and estimates 
the primary estimates used in the development of our accrual at december  and include total enrollment including employee contributions  population demographics  and historical claims costs incurred 
although we do not expect that we will ultimately pay claims significantly different from our estimates  self insurance reserves could be affected if future claims experience differs significantly from our historical trends and assumptions 
as part of this process  we engaged a third party actuarial firm to assist management in its analysis 
all estimates  key assumptions  and forecasts were either provided by or reviewed by us 
while we chose to utilize a third party actuary  the related valuation of our self insurance liability represents the conclusions of management and not the conclusions or statements of any third party 
while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available  if actual trends  including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation  differ from our estimates  our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows could be impacted 
fair value of financial instruments 
we invest our excess cash on deposit with major banks in money market  us treasury and government sponsored entity  foreign government  corporate debt  municipal  asset backed securities  and mortgage backed residential securities 
by policy  we invest primarily in high grade marketable securities 
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of default by the financial institutions or issuers of these investments to the extent of amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheets 
we consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents 
typically  the cost of these investments has approximated fair value 
marketable investments with a maturity greater than three months are classified as available for sale short term investments 
available for sale securities are stated at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity oci  adjusted for deferred income taxes 
the credit portion of any other than temporary impairment is included in net income 
realized gains and losses on sales of financial instruments are recognized upon sale of the investments using the specific identification method 
as a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements  asc establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy as more fully defined in note  investments and fair value measurements 
we utilize the market approach to measure fair value of our fixed income securities 
the market approach is a valuation technique that uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities 
the fair value of our fixed income securities are obtained using readily available market prices from a variety of industry standard data providers  large financial institutions  and other third party sources for the identical underlying securities 

table of contents as part of this process  we engaged pricing services to assist management in its analysis 
all estimates  key assumptions  and forecasts were either provided by or reviewed by us 
while we chose to utilize third party pricing services  the impairment analysis and related valuations represent the conclusions of management and not the conclusions or statements of any third party 
specifically  we obtain the fair value of our level financial instruments from third party asset managers  the custodian bank  and the accounting service providers 
independently  these service providers use professional pricing services to gather pricing data  which may include quoted market prices for identical or comparable instruments or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly 
the service providers then analyze their gathered pricing inputs and apply proprietary valuation techniques  including consensus pricing  weighted average pricing  distribution curve based algorithms  or pricing models such as discounted cash flow techniques to provide a fair value for each security 
the validation procedures performed by management include the following obtaining an understanding of the pricing service s valuation methodologies  including the timing and frequency  evaluating the type  nature  and complexity of our investments in financial instruments  evaluating the activity level in the market for the type of securities in which we have invested including the volatility of price movements requiring analysis  and validating the quoted market prices provided by our service providers by completing a three way reconciliation  comparing the assessment of the fair values provided by the asset manager  the custody bank and the accounting book of record provider for each portfolio 
obtaining an understanding of these valuation risks allows us to respond by developing internal controls that appropriately mitigate any risks identified 
if material discrepancies are noted when comparing the valuations on a security by security basis  then we conduct detailed pricing analysis  search alternative pricing sources  or require the service provider to provide an in depth price analysis prior to recording the fair value in our financial statements 
if we determine that a price provided by the third party pricing services is not reflective of the fair value of the security  we require the custodian bank or accounting service provider to update their price file accordingly 
at least annually  we review the pricing practices followed by the various entities involved in determining the fair value of our securities  including comparing their process and practices to those followed by other external third party pricing vendors 
also  at least annually  we review the internal controls provided in place at the custodian bank and the accounting service provider 
the fair value of our investments in certain money market funds is expected to maintain a net asset value of per share and  as such  is priced at the expected market price 
we review investments in debt securities for other than temporary impairment whenever the fair value is less than the amortized cost and evidence indicates the investment s carrying amount is not recoverable within a reasonable period of time 
we assess the fair value of individual securities as part of our ongoing portfolio management 
our other than temporary assessment includes reviewing the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than amortized cost  the seniority and durations of the securities  adverse conditions related to a security  industry  or sector  historical and projected issuer financial performance  credit ratings  issuer specific news  and other available relevant information 
to determine whether an impairment is other than temporary  we consider whether we have the intent to sell the impaired security or if it will be more likely than not that we will be required to sell the impaired security before a market price recovery and whether evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable outweighs evidence to the contrary 
we have determined that gross unrealized losses on short term investments at december  are temporary in nature because each investment meets our investment policy and credit quality requirements 
we have the ability and 
table of contents intent to hold these investments until they recover their unrealized losses  which may not be until maturity 
evidence that we will recover our investments outweighs evidence to the contrary 
in determining whether a credit loss existed  we used our best estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from each debt security 
for asset backed and mortgage backed securities  cash flow estimates including prepayment assumptions rely on data from widely accepted third party data sources or internal estimates 
in addition to prepayment assumptions  cash flow estimates vary based on assumptions regarding the underlying collateral including default rates  recoveries  and changes in value 
expected cash flows were discounted using the effective interest rate implicit in the securities 
accounting for stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with asc  which requires stock based compensation expense to be recognized based on the fair value of such awards on the date of grant 
we amortize stock based compensation expense on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period  after assessing the probability of achieving the requisite performance criteria with respect to performance based awards 
stock based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche as though the award were  in substance  multiple awards 
we apply an estimated forfeiture rate based on historical experience and management assessment to reflect what we believe will be our final stock based compensation expense 
we must use our judgment in determining and applying the assumptions needed for the valuation of employee stock options  rsus  restricted stock awards rsas  and issuance of common stock under our espp 
we use the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model to value stock based compensation for all equity awards  except market based awards 
market based awards are valued using a monte carlo valuation model 
option pricing models were developed to estimate the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable 
the bsm model determines the fair value of stock based payment awards based on the stock price on the date of grant and is affected by assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  expected term  interest rates  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behavior 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock over a preceding period commensurate with the expected term of the option 
the expected term is based on management s consideration of the historical life  vesting period  and contractual period of the options granted 
the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
expected dividend yield was not considered in the option pricing formula since we do not pay dividends and have no current plans to do so in the future 
accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required to determine our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
we estimate our actual current tax expense  including permanent charges and benefits  and temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue for tax and book accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income by considering both positive and negative evidence relating to their recoverability 
if we believe that recovery of these deferred tax assets is not more likely than not  we establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent that we increase a valuation allowance in a period  we include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such determination is made 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we considered all available evidence  including recent operating results  projections of future taxable income  our ability to utilize loss and credit carryforwards  and the feasibility of tax planning strategies 
a significant piece of objective positive evidence evaluated was cumulative pre tax income over the three years ended december  in addition  we considered that loss and credit 
table of contents carryforwards have not expired unused and a majority of our loss and credit carryforwards will not expire prior to finally  we have considered that our results from operations have improved each year since as a result of this evaluation  we have determined that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit related to our deferred tax assets  except for a valuation allowance on foreign tax credits resulting from the acquisition of best gmbh and compensation deductions potentially limited by irc m 
the realizability of deferred tax assets could be negatively impacted if sufficient taxable income in the carryforward period is not generated 
current and noncurrent deferred tax assets  net of current and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities  as of december  were million  net of valuation allowance of million 
in accordance with asc through  income taxes basic recognition threshold  we account for uncertainty in income taxes by recognizing a tax position only when it is more likely than not that the tax position  based on its technical merits  will be sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable tax authority 
the tax benefit to be recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the applicable tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
significant management judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions 
our gross unrecognized benefits are million as of december  our evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
if actual settlements differ from these estimates  or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to recognize additional tax benefits or charges that could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
as of december   we have permanently reinvested million of unremitted foreign earnings 
should these earnings be remitted to the us  the tax on these earnings would be million 
valuation analyses of goodwill and intangible assets 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of each year according to the provisions of asc a two step impairment test of goodwill is required 
in the first step  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the fair value exceeds carrying value  goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required 
if the carrying value exceeds fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is required to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit  excluding goodwill  from the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in the first step 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then an impairment loss must be recorded equal to the difference 
our goodwill valuation analysis is based on our respective reporting units industrial inkjet  productivity software  and fiery  which are consistent with our operating segments identified in note segment information  geographic data  and major customers of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we determined the fair value of our reporting units as of december  by equally weighting the market and income approaches 
under the market approach  we estimated fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings of comparable companies 
under the income approach  we estimated fair value based on a projected cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
based on our valuation results  we have determined that the fair values of our reporting units exceed their carrying values 
industrial inkjet  productivity software  and fiery fair values are   and million  respectively  which exceed carrying value by   and  respectively 

table of contents significant management judgments are required in order to assess goodwill impairment  including the following identification of comparable companies to benchmark under the market approach giving due consideration to the following factors financial condition and operating performance of the reporting unit being evaluated relative to companies operating in the same or similar businesses  economic  environmental  and political factors faced by such companies  and companies that are considered to be reasonable investment alternatives 
impact of goodwill impairments recognized in prior years  including especially the million impairment recognized in related to the industrial inkjet operating segment  susceptibility of our reporting unit to fair value fluctuations  reporting unit revenue  gross profit  and operating expense growth rates  five year financial forecasts  discount rate to apply to estimated cash flows  terminal values based on the gordon growth methodology  appropriate market comparables  estimated multiples of revenue and earnings before interest expense and taxes ebit that a willing buyer is likely to pay  estimated control premium a willing buyer is likely to pay  including consideration of the following the most similar transactions in relevant industries and determined the average premium indicated by the transactions deemed to be most similar to a hypothetical transaction involving our reporting units weighted average and median control premiums offered in relevant industries  industry specific control premiums  and specific transaction control premiums 
significant events or changes in circumstances including the following significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  our market capitalization relative to net book value  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets  significant changes in the strategy for our overall business  and our assessment of growth and profitability in each reporting unit over the coming years 
given the uncertainty of the economic environment and the potential impact on our business  there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions regarding the duration of the ongoing economic downturn  or the period or strength of recovery  made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing at december  will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
if our assumptions regarding forecasted revenue or gross profit rates are not achieved  we may be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods relating to any of our reporting units  whether in connection with the next annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of or prior to that  if any such change constitutes an interim triggering event 
it is not possible to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or  if it does  whether such charge would be material 

table of contents as part of this process  we engaged a third party valuation firm to assist management in its analysis 
all estimates  key assumptions  and forecasts were either provided by or reviewed by us 
while we chose to utilize a third party valuation firm  the impairment analysis and related valuations represent the conclusions of management and not the conclusions or statements of any third party 
business combinations 
we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  including ipr d  and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
the results of operations for each acquisition are included in our financial statements from the date of acquisition 
we account for business acquisitions as purchase business combinations in accordance with asc the fundamental requirement of asc is that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business combinations 
see note the company and its significant accounting policies of our notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of the requirements of this accounting pronouncement with respect to accounting for business combinations 
management estimates fair value based on assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include  but are not limited to future expected cash flows  acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop ipr d into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio  and discount rates 
we estimate the fair value of acquisition related contingent consideration based on the probability of realization of the performance targets 
this estimate is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market  which asc refers to as level inputs  reflecting our assessment of the assumptions market participants would use to value these liabilities 
the fair value of contingent consideration is measured at each reporting period  with any changes in the fair value recognized as a component of general and administrative expense 
other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions include severance costs and the costs to vacate or downsize facilities  including the future costs to operate and eventually abandon or relinquish duplicate facilities 
these costs are recognized as restructuring and other expenses and are based on management estimates and are subject to refinement 
estimated costs may change as additional information becomes available regarding assets acquired and liabilities assumed and as management continues its assessment of the pre merger operations 
acquisition related costs of   and million were expensed during the years ended december   and  respectively  associated with businesses acquired during the periods reported and anticipated transactions in see note acquisitions of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the business acquisitions completed during the years ended december    and our financial projections may ultimately prove to be inaccurate and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
as a result  these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable  assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur  which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or other actual results 
therefore  no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to establish the valuation for these acquired businesses will prove to be correct 
we typically engage a third party valuation firm to assist management in its analysis 
all estimates  key assumptions  and forecasts were either provided by or reviewed by us 
while we chose to utilize a third party valuation firm  the valuations represent the conclusions of management and not the conclusions or statements of any third party 

table of contents determining functional currencies for the purpose of consolidating our international operations 
we have a number of foreign subsidiaries  which together account for approximately of our net revenue  approximately of our total assets  and approximately of our total liabilities as of december  although the majority of our receivables are invoiced and collected in us dollars  we have exposure from non us dollar denominated sales consisting of the euro  british pound sterling  japanese yen  brazilian real  australian dollar  and new zealand dollar and operating expenses primarily the euro  indian rupee  british pound sterling  japanese yen  brazilian real  and australian dollar in foreign countries 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we must remeasure and translate balance sheet and income statement amounts into us dollars 
foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured from the transaction currency into the functional currency at current exchange rates  except for non monetary assets and capital accounts  which are remeasured at historical exchange rates 
revenue and expenses are remeasured at monthly exchange rates  which approximate average exchange rates in effect during each period 
gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income expense  net 
net gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions  including hedging gains and losses  are reported in other income expense  net  and were a gain loss of   and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
for those subsidiaries that operate in a local currency functional environment  all assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using current exchange rates  while revenue and expenses are translated using monthly exchange rates  which approximate the average exchange rates in effect during each period 
resulting translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of oci  adjusted for deferred income taxes 
the cumulative translation adjustment balance at december  was an unrealized gain of million 
based on our assessment of the salient economic indicators discussed in asc  foreign currency matters  we consider the us dollar to be the functional currency for each of our international subsidiaries except for our brazilian subsidiary  metrics  for which we consider the brazilian real to be the subsidiary s functional currency  our german subsidiaries  efi gmbh and alphagraph  for which we consider the euro to be the subsidiaries functional currency  our japanese subsidiary  electronics for imaging japan kk  for which we consider the japanese yen to be the subsidiary s functional currency  our spanish subsidiary  cretaprint  for which we consider the euro to be the subsidiary s functional currency  our new zealand subsidiary contains the prism operations in new zealand for which we consider the new zealand dollar to the functional currency  our australian subsidiary contains the prism and ops operations in australia for which we consider the australian dollar to the functional currency  our uk subsidiaries  electronics for imaging united kingdom limited  prism group holdings limited uk  and technique  for which we consider the british pound sterling to be the subsidiaries functional currency  and our subsidiary in the people s republic of china  which contains the operations of our cretaprint sales and support center for which we consider the renminbi to be the functional currency

if these funds are needed for our operations in the us  we would be required to accrue and pay us federal and state income taxes on some or all of these funds 
however  our intent is to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside of the us and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 
based on past performance and current expectations  we believe that our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and cash generated from operating activities will satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditure  investment requirements  business acquisitions  stock repurchases  commitments see note commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations through at least the next twelve months

the net change in operating assets and liabilities of million consists primarily of increases in inventories  accounts receivable  and other current assets of   and million  respectively  decreases in net taxes payable of million  partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million 
accounts receivable our primary source of operating cash flow is the collection of accounts receivable from our customers 
one measure of the effectiveness of our collection efforts is average days sales outstanding for accounts receivable dso 
dsos were   and days at december    and  respectively 
we calculate dso by dividing net accounts receivable at the end of the quarter by revenue recognized during the quarter  multiplied by the total days in the quarter 
dso improved in due to strong collections 
dsos increased during the year ended december  primarily due to cretaprint s less efficient cash conversion cycle  invoicing of annual productivity software maintenance billings  international mix shift  and the product mix shift between industrial inkjet and fiery revenue 
we expect dsos to vary from period to period because of changes in the mix of business between direct customers and end user demand driven through the leading printer manufacturers  the effectiveness of our collection efforts both domestically and overseas  and variations in the linearity of our sales 
as the percentage of industrial inkjet and productivity software related revenue increases  we expect dsos may trend higher 
our dsos related to the industrial inkjet and productivity software operating segments are traditionally higher than those related to the significant printer manufacturer customers distributors in our fiery operating segment as  historically  they have paid on a more timely basis 
we have facilities in spain that enable us to sell to third parties  on an ongoing basis  certain trade receivables without recourse 
the trade receivables sold without recourse are generally short term receivables with payment due dates of less than one year  which are secured by international letters of credit 
we also have facilities in the us that enable us to sell to third parties  on an ongoing basis  certain trade receivables with recourse 
the trade receivables sold with recourse are generally short term receivables with payment due dates of less than days  which are subject to a servicing obligation 
trade receivables sold under these facilities were and million on a recourse and nonrecourse basis  respectively  which approximates the cash received in we report collections from the sale of trade receivables to third parties as operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows  because such receivables are the result of an operating activity and the associated interest rate risk is de minimis 
inventories our inventories are procured primarily in support of the industrial inkjet and fiery operating segments 
our net inventories increased by million from million in to million in primarily due to inventories acquired in the cretaprint acquisition  industrial inkjet inventory build to support new product launches in the fourth quarter of and in anticipation of product launches scheduled for the upcoming quarter  and the mix shift between industrial inkjet and fiery revenue 
the majority of our industrial inkjet products are manufactured internally  while fiery production is primarily outsourced 
this results in lower inventory turnover for industrial inkjet inventories compared with fiery inventories 
inventory turnover declined from turns during the quarter ended december  to turns during the quarter ended december  we calculate inventory turnover by dividing annualized current quarter cost of revenue by ending inventories

our property and equipment additions have historically been funded from operating activities 
we anticipate that we will continue to purchase property and equipment in the normal course of our business 
the amount and timing of these purchases and the related cash outflows in future periods are difficult to predict and are dependent on a number of factors including our hiring of employees  the rate of change in computer hardware and software used in our business  our business outlook  and decisions to further invest or expand business sites 

table of contents on november   we sold the  square foot building located at velocity way in foster city  california  which serves as our corporate headquarters  along with approximately four acres of land and certain other assets related to the property  to gilead for cash proceeds of million  net of direct transaction costs paid in direct transaction costs consist primarily of documentary transfer and title costs  legal fees  and other expenses 
we will continue to use the facility for up to one year for which rent is not required to be paid 
this constitutes a form of continuing involvement that prevents gain recognition

purchases of marketable securities  net of proceeds and maturities  were million in the proceeds from the sale of building and land have been invested in money market funds at december  we have classified our investment portfolio as available for sale 
our investments are made with a policy of capital preservation and liquidity as primary objectives 
we may hold investments in fixed income debt securities to maturity  however  we may sell an investment at any time if the quality rating of the investment declines  the yield on the investment is no longer attractive  or we have better uses for the cash 
since we invest primarily in investment securities that are highly liquid with a ready market  we believe the purchase  maturity  or sale of our investments has no material impact on our overall liquidity 
other investments  included within other assets  consist of equity and debt investments in privately held companies that develop products  markets  and services that are considered to be strategic to us 
each of these investments had been fully impaired in prior years 
in  we sold one of these investments  which we no longer considered to be strategic  and received the proceeds from the sale of million 
restricted cash and investments we are required to maintain restricted cash of million as of december  related to customer agreements that were obtained with the alphagraph and cretaprint acquisitions 
the current portion of million represents the portion of the restriction that will be released within twelve months and is included in other current assets 
the noncurrent portion of million is included in other assets 
as of december   we were subject to a synthetic lease lease covering our foster city office facility located at velocity way  foster city  california 
the lease included an option to purchase the facility during or at the end of the lease term for the amount that the lessor paid for the facility million 
the funds pledged under the lease were in libor based interest bearing accounts  which were restricted as to withdrawal at all times 
we exercised our purchase option in the fourth quarter of with respect to the lease in connection with the sale of the land and building to gilead 
we will continue to use the facility for up to one year for which rent is not required to be paid 
this constitutes a form of continuing involvement that prevents gain recognition 
until we vacate the building  the proceeds from the sale are accounted for as deferred proceeds from property transaction on our consolidated balance sheet  which is currently million  including imputed interest costs 
the million of previously pledged funds are classified as land  buildings  and improvements within property and equipment  net  in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  financing activities historically  our recurring cash flows provided by financing activities have been from the receipt of cash from the issuance of common stock through the exercise of stock options and for espp shares 
we received proceeds from the exercise of stock options of   and million and employee purchases of espp shares of 
table of contents   and million in   and  respectively 
the recent increase in stock option exercise proceeds primarily relates to the retirement of a senior executive 
while we may continue to receive proceeds from these plans in future periods  the timing and amount of such proceeds are difficult to predict and are contingent on a number of factors including the price of our common stock  the number of employees participating in the plans  and general market conditions 
we anticipate that cash provided from the exercise of stock options may decline over time as we shift to issuance of rsus  rather than stock options 
the primary use of funds for financing activities in   and was   and million  respectively  of cash used to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock including cash used for net settlement of the exercise price of certain stock options and any tax withholding obligations incurred in connection with such exercises and employee common stock related tax liabilities 
in february and august  our board of directors authorized a total of million for the repurchase of our outstanding common stock 
we repurchased million shares for an aggregate purchase price of million during the year ended december  on august   our board of directors cancelled the million remaining for repurchase under the authorizations and approved a new authorization to repurchase million of outstanding common stock 
this authorization expires in february under this publicly announced plan  we repurchased a total of million shares for an aggregate purchase price of million during the year ended december  see item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters  and issuer purchases of equity securities for further discussion of our common stock repurchase programs 
earnout payments made in related to previously accrued fx colors  streamline  and radius contingent consideration liabilities of   and million  respectively 
the difference between the million radius earnout liability and the amount paid represents a disputed escrow retention 
the portion of the radius earnout representing performance targets achieved in excess of amounts assumed in the opening balance sheet as of the acquisition date was million and will be reflected as cash used for operating activities in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows once the escrow dispute is resolved 
earnout payments made in related to previously accrued radius contingent consideration liabilities of million 
the portion of the radius earnout representing performance targets achieved in excess of amounts assumed in the opening balance sheet as of the acquisition date was million and were reflected as cash used for operating activities in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows 
other commitments our industrial inkjet inventories consist of raw materials and finished goods  print heads  frames  digital uv ink  and other components in support of our internal manufacturing operations and solvent ink  which is purchased from third party contract manufacturers responsible for manufacturing our solvent ink 
our fiery inventory consists primarily of raw materials and finished goods  memory subsystems  processors  and asics  which are sold to third party contract manufacturers responsible for manufacturing our products 
should we decide to purchase components and manufacture fiery controllers internally  or should it become necessary for us to purchase and sell components other than processors  asics  or memory subsystems to our contract manufacturers  inventory balances and potentially property and equipment would increase significantly  thereby reducing our available cash resources 
further  the inventories we carry could become obsolete  thereby negatively impacting our financial condition and results of operations 
we are also reliant on several sole source suppliers for certain key components and could experience a further significant negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations if such supplies were reduced or not available 
we may be required to compensate our subcontract manufacturers for components purchased for orders subsequently cancelled by us 
we periodically review the potential liability and the adequacy of the related allowance 
our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if we were required to compensate our subcontract manufacturers in amounts in excess of the related allowance

contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as liabilities at december   with the exception of acquisition related contingent consideration liabilities 
payments due by period in thousands total less than year between years between years more than years operating lease obligations contingent consideration liabilities purchase obligations total represents the fair value of acquisition related contingent consideration liabilities 
the current fair value is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets under the caption accrued and other liabilities and represents the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities that are payable within one year 
the noncurrent fair value is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets under the caption noncurrent contingent and other liabilities and represents the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities that are payable beyond one year 
excludes contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities and certain purchase orders as discussed below 
purchase obligations in the table above include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable  non cancellable  and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum  or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude purchase orders for raw materials and other goods and services that are cancelable without penalty 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are generally fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
the expected timing of payment for the obligations listed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on when the goods or services are received or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
the above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of million  the timing of which is uncertain 
see note income taxes of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of unrecognized tax benefits 
off balance sheet financing synthetic lease arrangements as of december   we were a party to the lease covering our foster city facility located at velocity way  foster city  california 
the lease provided a cost effective means of providing adequate office space for our corporate offices and was scheduled to expire by its terms in july the lease included an option 
table of contents allowing us to purchase the facility for the amount paid by the lessor for the facility 
the million pledged under the lease was in libor based interest bearing accounts as of december  and was restricted from withdrawal at all times 
on november   we sold the  square foot velocity way building  along with approximately four acres of land and certain other assets related to the property  for million 
we exercised our purchase option with respect to the lease in connection with the sale of the building and land and terminated the corresponding lease 
we will continue to use the facility for up to one year for which rent is not required to be paid 
this constitutes a form of continuing involvement that prevents gain recognition 
until we vacate the building  the proceeds from the sale will be accounted for as deferred proceeds from property transaction on our consolidated balance sheet  which is currently million  including imputed interest costs 
the million of previously pledged funds are classified as land  buildings  and improvements within property and equipment  net  in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  we were in compliance with all financial and merger related lease covenants prior to the termination of the lease 
we had guaranteed to the lessor a residual value associated with the building equal to of their funding of the lease 
we were required to maintain a minimum net worth and tangible net worth as of the end of each quarter as well as certain additional covenants regarding mergers 
we were liable to the lessor for the financed amount of the buildings if we defaulted on our covenants 
we assessed our exposure relating to the first loss guarantee under the lease and determined there was no deficiency to the guaranteed value 
prior to the termination of the lease  we were treated as the owner of the building for federal income tax purposes 
in conjunction with the lease  we had been leasing the land on which the building is located to the lessor of the building 
this separate ground lease was for approximately years  but was terminated in conjunction with the completion of the sale of the building and land to gilead 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion of our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
market risk we are exposed to various market risks 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  general credit  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation  liquidity  and interest rate risks  which may be exacerbated by the tight global credit market and increase in economic uncertainty that have affected various sectors of the financial market and continue to cause credit and liquidity issues 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we may enter into financial instrument contracts to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings and cash flows 
the counterparties to such contracts are major financial institutions 
we hedge our operating expense exposure in indian rupees 
the notional amount of our indian rupee cash flow hedge was million at december  we had not entered into hedges against any other currency exposures as of december   but we may consider hedging against movements in other currencies as well as adjusting the hedged portion of our indian rupee exposure in the future 
see financial risk management below for a discussion of european market risk 
interest rate risk marketable securities we maintain an investment portfolio of short term fixed income debt securities of various holdings  types  and maturities 
these short term investments are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate 
table of contents component of oci 
we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by investing in securities with maturities of less than three years  however  we may be unable to successfully limit our risk to interest rate fluctuations 
at any time  a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings for our portfolio 
we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 
hypothetical changes in the fair values of the financial instruments held by us at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates are presented in the table below 
the modeling technique measures the change in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 
market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points over a twelve month time horizon in thousands valuation of securities assuming an interest rate decrease of basis points no change in interest rates valuation of securities assuming an interest rate increase of basis points foreign currency exchange risk a large portion of our business is conducted in countries other than the us we are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates for the euro  british pound sterling  indian rupee  japanese yen  brazilian real  and australian dollar 
although the majority of our receivables are invoiced and collected in us dollars  we have exposure from non us dollar denominated sales consisting of the euro  british pound sterling  japanese yen  brazilian real  australian dollar  and new zealand dollar and operating expenses primarily the euro  british pound sterling  japanese yen  indian rupee  brazilian real  and australian dollar in foreign countries 
we can benefit from a weaker dollar and we can be adversely affected from a stronger dollar relative to major currencies world wide 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a weakening of the us dollar  may adversely affect our consolidated operating expenses and operating income loss as expressed in us dollars 
we hedge our operating expense exposure in indian rupees 
the notional amount of our indian rupee cash flow hedge was million at december  we had not entered into hedges against any other currency exposures as of december   but we may consider hedging against movements in other currencies as well as adjusting the hedged portion of our indian rupee exposure in the future 
the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign exchanges rates on revenue and income from operations are presented in the table below 
the modeling technique measures the change in revenue and income from operations resulting from changes in selected foreign exchange rates with respect to the euro and british pound sterling of plus or minus one percent during the year ended december  as follows in thousands impact of a foreign exchange rate decrease of one percent no change in foreign exchange rates impact of a foreign exchange rate increase of one percent revenue income from operations financial risk management as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our exposures are related to non us dollar denominated sales in europe  japan  the uk  latin america  australia  and new zealand and are primarily related to operating expenses in europe  india  japan  the uk  brazil  and australia 
we hedge our operating expense exposure in indian rupees 
as of 
table of contents december   we had not entered into hedges against any other currency exposures  but we may consider hedging against movements in other currencies as well as adjusting the hedged portion of our indian rupee exposure in the future 
we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types  and maturities 
we typically utilize money market  us treasury and government sponsored entity  foreign government  corporate debt  municipal  asset backed  and mortgage backed residential securities 
these short term investments are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of oci 
these securities are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading 
sec division of corporation finance disclosure guidance topic guidance topic  european sovereign debt  encourages registrants to discuss their exposure to the uncertainty in the european economy 
specifically  registrants are asked to disclose their european debt by counterparty ie  sovereign and non sovereign and by country 
we have no european sovereign debt investments 
our european debt and money market investments consist of non sovereign corporate debt included within money market funds and corporate debt securities of million  which represents of our money market funds and corporate debt securities at december  our european debt investments are with corporations domiciled in the northern and central european countries of sweden  germany  netherlands  switzerland  denmark  luxembourg  norway  france  belgium  and the uk however  approximately million  or of our european investments  consists of money market funds with two banks in the southern european country of spain 
we believe that we do not have significant exposure with respect to our corporate debt investments in europe 
our money market investments meet the definition of cash equivalents at december  since europe represents a significant portion of our revenue and cash flow  guidance topic encourages disclosure of our european concentrations of credit risk regarding gross receivables  related reserves  and aging on a region or country basis  and the impact on liquidity with respect to estimated timing of receivable payments 
since europe is composed of varied countries and regional economies  our european risk profile is somewhat more diversified due to the varying economic conditions among the countries 
approximately of our receivables are with european customers as of december  of this amount  of our european receivables of consolidated net receivables are in the higher risk southern european countries mostly spain  italy  and portugal  which are adequately reserved 
the ongoing relocation of the ceramic tile industry from southern europe to the emerging markets of china  india  brazil  and indonesia will reduce our exposure to credit risk in southern europe
