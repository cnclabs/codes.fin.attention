results of operations revenue for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or from  for the previous year 
revenue of offset printing paper and corrugating medium paper revenue from sales of offset printing paper and corrugating medium paper for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or from  for previous year in the increase was the result of a number of favorable and unfavorable factors  including an increase in sales of corrugating medium paper as we ramp up the production of the new  tonnes year production line pm during year  decreases in average selling prices asps of and for corrugating medium and offset printing paper  respectively  during the year ended december  compared to the previous year  a decrease in revenue caused by the suspension of trading activities of offset printing paper since january  and production interruptions in the second and third quarters of due to the malfunctioning water treatment plant and installation of new boilers 
total offset printing and corrugating medium paper sold during the year ended december  amounted to  tonnes  an increase of  tonnes or  compared to  tonnes sold in the comparable period in the previous year 
despite the increased contribution in tonnage sold by the new pm in as further explained below  we sold only tonnes of offset printing paper finished goods that we purchased from other manufacturers for a revenue of  during the year ended december  in january  we suspended all of our trading due to downward pricing pressure that squeezes trading profit margin 
in comparison  during the year ended december   we sold  tonnes of offset printing paper or of total printing paper sold for that period purchased from other manufacturers for a revenue of  during the year ended december   we produced and sold  tonnes of corrugating medium paper from the new pm that we launched in december with the additional tonnage produced by pm  total quantity of corrugating medium paper sold during the year ended december  was  tonnes  an increase of  tonnes or from  tonnes in the previous year 
the changes in revenue dollar amount and in tonnage from the year ended december  to year are summarized as follows year ended year ended change in change in percentage december  december  sales revenue qty

the asps for our main products for the years ended december  and are summarized as follows offset printing paper asp corrugating medium paper asp year ended december  year ended december  decrease from comparable period in the previous year decrease as a percentage the following is a chart showing the month by month asps excluding the asps of the digital photo paper for the month period ended december corrugating medium paper revenue from corrugating medium paper amounted to  or of total offset printing paper and corrugating medium paper revenue for the year ended december   representing a  or increase over the corrugating medium paper revenue of  for the previous year in we sold  tonnes of corrugating medium paper for the year ended december  as compared to  tonnes for the previous year in  representing a increase in quantities sold 
despite the increase in sales quantity  asp for corrugating medium paper dropped from tonne for the year ended december  to tonne for the year ended december   representing a year over year decrease 
the decline in the asp appears to be a result of the economic slowdown throughout china  as manufacturing activities contracted due to the debt and fiscal crisis in europe as well as the chinese government s effort to cool off the domestic construction activities 
we believe the asp for the corrugating medium paper may not fundamentally improve until the chinese government announces new economic policies to stimulate domestic economy and consumer spending 
we launched the new  tonnes year corrugating medium pm in december we are in the process of ramping up the new production line pm for the year of  we sold  tonnes of corrugating medium produced by the new production line 
quantities sold from the commencement to december are as follows 
offset printing paper revenue from offset printing paper amounted to  or of total offset printing paper and corrugating medium paper revenue for the year ended december   which represents a  or decrease from the offset printing paper revenue of  for the comparable period in we sold  tonnes of offset printing paper in the year ended december  compared to  tonnes of offset printing paper in the comparable period in year  a decrease of  tonnes or 
we believe that the factors contributing to the decrease in both total quantity and dollar amount sold in the year ended december  include a softening demand for printing paper in our region  possibly due to a slowdown of the economy  the decrease in asp for offset printing paper products from tonne in the year ended december  to tonne in the year ended december   representing a decrease of  the suspension of offset printing paper trading activities due to shrinking profit margin since january  as explained above  and production interruption in the second and third quarters of because of the water treatment plant malfunction and the installation of new boilers 
gross revenue from trading of offset printing paper finished goods is  or tonnes for the year ended december   representing of total sales revenue of offset print paper for the current year  while gross revenue from trading of offset printing paper finished goods was  or  tonnes for the previous year in and accounted for of the gross revenue of offset printing paper for revenue of digital photo paper revenue generated from selling digital photo paper was  or of total revenue for the year ended december   a decrease of  or from  or of total revenue for the year ended december  when comparing to the year ended december   the asp of our digital photo paper decreased from  tonne to  tonne 
we sold  tonnes of digital photo paper in the year ended december   as compared to  tonnes in the same period a year ago 
as there are increasingly more residential buildings and residents living in the surrounding areas of our digital photo paper plant  we have been under increasing pressure since october by local residents and from government urban planning officials to minimize our operations during night time  which resulted in a curtailment of our production schedule 
digital photo paper produced in the fourth quarter of was tonnes  versus tonnes in the comparable quarter in  representing a quarterly decline 
besides the reduced production in the fourth quarter of  the year over year decline in quantity sold and the year over year decline in asp  which appears to be a result of softening customer demand due to the slowdown in the economy 
we believe the market demand and the asp may not fully recover until the first half of year  or until fundamental changes in the prc domestic economy take place 
we currently produce glossy and semi matte photo paper in various weights from g m to g m 
because of the depressed domestic economy  we believe there will still be market pricing pressure on digital photo paper in the near future 
digital photo paper products monthly asps  monthly sales quantity in tonnes and monthly sales revenue for the months from january to december are summarized as follows cost of sales corrugating medium paper and offset printing paper total cost of sales for corrugating medium paper and offset printing paper for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or from  for the comparable period in the net increase in total corrugating medium and offset printing paper cost of sales in appears to be primarily due to the increase in the total quantity of paper sold in  tonnes versus in  tonnes 
as explained above  total sales revenue excluding revenue from sales of digital photo paper increased from  in the year ended december  to  in the comparable period in year  representing a year over year increase 
cost of sales for total corrugating medium paper amounted to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the previous year in the  increase in corrugating medium paper cost of sales was further offset by a reduction in offset printing paper cost of sales 
changes in cost of sales and cost per tonne by product for the three month periods ended december  and are summarized below for the year ended for the year ended december  december  change in change in percentage cost of sales cost per tonne cost of sales cost per tonne cost of sales cost per tonne cost of sales cost per tone corrugating medium paper   offset printing paper   total corrugating medium and offset printing paper  n a  n a  n a n a monthly average purchase costs of our major raw materials for the period beginning january and ending december are as follows over the period of months ended december   costs for all types of raw materials in the first three quarters of year were generally on an upward trend and reached the highest point over the period toward the end of october  then started to decline since november  as downstream demand for all paper products showed weakness because of the economic slowdown in china 
our average unit purchase costs net of applicable value added tax of recycled paper board  recycled white scrap paper  and recycled printed paper in the month of october were tonne  tonne  and tonne  respectively 
starting from november  the raw material prices have been declining  reflecting a softening demand from other paper producers in an economic slowdown 
by the month of december  the average unit purchase costs of recycled paper board  recycled white scrap paper  and recycled printed paper were tonne  tonne  and tonne  respectively  which represent decreases of  and from the prices in october  respectively 
our production uses entirely domestic recycled paper produced mainly from the beijing tianjin metropolitan area and do not have to rely on imported recycled paper  which tends to have a more volatile pricing behavior than the domestic recycled paper 
depending on the regional economic outlook in the year of  we believe that the future waste paper raw material costs may continue to reflect weaker market demand 
total depreciation allocated to corrugating medium and offset printing paper for the year ended december  was  an increase of  from that of the previous year of in the amount of  out of the depreciation expense   or tonne was allocated to the corrugating medium paper produced by the new  tonnes year new production line pm electricity and coal are the two main energy sources of our paper manufacturing activities 
coal prices have been subject to seasonal fluctuations in china  with peaks often occurring in the winter months 
historically  electricity and coal account for approximately and of our total cost of sales  or approximately and of total sales  respectively 
however  as we ramp up the run rate of the new corrugating medium pm  which is considerably more energy efficient  we expect to see the portion in sales and cost of sales represented by electricity and coal to decrease over time 
the monthly energy costs electricity and coal as a percentage of total monthly cost of sales and sales of our main paper products for the months ended december  are summarized as follow digital photo paper total cost of sales of digital photo paper amounted to  for the year ended december   representing a decrease of  or  over the cost of sales of  in the comparable period in year the decrease is primarily due to the reduction in production and a decrease in sales quantity of our digital photo paper products in year as compared to year during the year ended december   regular repairs and maintenance expense included in the digital photo paper cost of sales was in the amount of  as compared to  in the year of gross profit corrugating medium paper and offset printing paper gross profit for corrugating medium paper and offset printing paper for the year ended december  was  a net decrease of  or from  for the previous year in the net decrease in gross profit was primarily attributable to the and year over year declines in asps of our offset printing paper and corrugating medium paper explained above in the discussion of changes in revenue above  a year over year increase in cost of sales for offset printing paper and corrugating medium paper in the year of  versus a smaller growth in sales  and the difference of the  gross profit in the year of that was contributed by trading of offset printing paper purchased from third party suppliers  which has been discontinued since january because of the declining asps  gross profit margin of corrugating medium paper and offset printing paper generally have been decreasing since the beginning of for the year ended december   our gross profit margins of corrugating medium paper and offset printing paper were and  respectively 
in comparison  the gross profit margins of corrugating medium paper and offset printing paper for the year of were and  respectively 
monthly gross profit margins on the sales of our corrugating medium paper and offset printing paper for the month period ending december  are as follows digital photo paper gross profit from the sales of digital photo paper for the year ended december  amounted to  or as a percentage of total digital photo paper sales  compared with  or as a percentage to total digital photo paper sales in the last year 
the decline of gross profit margin is a direct result of both lower production quantity and in terms of quantity sold  less than the same period in and a lower asp lower than the asp in the same period of previous year 
the low asp of digital photo paper reflects the contraction of the domestic consumption and business activities including commercial advertising since the beginning of year we believe that the chinese economy may not fully recover to the pre level at least until the first half of selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or from  for the previous year of the increase was mainly attributable to the fair value of the issuance of  shares of common stock to certain of our directors and officers in january as compensation for their services to the company  which was recorded as a one time compensation expense of  during the first quarter of  the increase of insurance expense mainly the directors officers liability insurance in year for  a decrease in gain on foreign currency transaction in for  additional building depreciation for the three new dormitory buildings in the headquarters compound and land use rights amortization for the land acquired in april of  in year  a reversal of prior period accumulated over provisions in december of employee prc statutory fringe benefit in the amount of  new lease expenses of  in land lease in wei county for the fourth quarter of  an increase of  in the repairs and maintenance over the amount for the previous year  and a year over year increase of  in salaries and wages for non office employees 
for the year ended december  the expenses incurred or accrued for legal and accounting auditing fees amounted to  as compared to  during previous year in income from operations operating income for the year ended december  was  a decrease of  or from  for the previous year in in addition to the changes in gross profit and selling  general and administrative expenses  which collectively account for  in the year to year decrease in income from operation  the difference also reflects the following gain and losses for the year ended december  a  loss on impairment of assets associated with the company s plan to renovate its  tonnes year corrugating medium pm and to rebuild it with a new capacity of  tonnes year and the resulting provision for loss on the retirement and demolition of certain pm equipments in year  and a  gain from net proceeds of the disposal of other production equipments 
for the year ended december   the company recognized a loss in the amount of  for the disposal of various production equipments and the demolition of an old employee cafeteria building 
net income net income was  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or from  for the previous year in in addition to the changes described above  the decrease is also attributable to a year over year increase in interest expense in the amount of  in the year ended december  such increase in interest expense was due to an increase of short term borrowing from  as of december  to  as of december  accounts receivable net accounts receivable decreased by  or to  as of december   compared to  as of december  due to more cash on delivery customers accounts for the sales of corrugating medium paper 
we usually collect accounts receivable within days of delivery and completion of sales 
inventories inventories consist of raw materials accounting for of total value of ending inventory as of december  and finished goods 
as of december   the recorded value of inventory increased by to  from  as of december  the largest change came from the inventory item of recycled paperboard  which is the main raw material for the production of corrugating medium paper and was stated at  as of december  the balance of recycled paperboard on december  was higher than the balance at december  by  due to the additional needs for raw material by the new pm corrugating medium paper production 
a summary of changes in major inventory items is as follows december  december  change change raw materials recycled paper board    pulp   recycled printed paper    recycled white scrap paper    coal    digital photo base paper and other raw materials  total raw materials    finished goods    totals    accounts payable accounts payable excluding non inventory purchase payables and accrued expenses was  as of december   a decrease of  or from  as of december  in addition to regular trade accounts payable  the company had notes payable to one of its major suppliers in the total amount of  as of december  the combined balance payable as of december  to its vendors in the amount of  an increase of  from the accounts payable balance a year ago is primarily for the purchase of recycled paperboard  which is the major raw material for the production of corrugating medium paper 
liquidity and capital resources overview as of december   we had net working capital of  an increase of  or over net working capital of  on december  our current liabilities increased from december  to the end of year by  mainly due to a related party security deposit in the amount of  and the  in current portion of long term debt as of december  that was not classified as current in cash and cash equivalents increased by  as we completed the pm construction and started to build up cash balance for the tissue paper production line project

capital expenditures in addition to the binding contracts that we have entered into  we are also planning for several other capital expenditure projects for the years of and these projects include building additional warehouses and new offices  cafeteria  and production line worker living quarters over the land across the street that we acquired in april for an estimated cost of million  ancillary facilities for the tissue paper pm and other infrastructures in the wei county plant for an estimated cost of million  a second  tonnes year tissue paper production line to be designated as pm for an estimated cost of million  and major renovation of the old corrugating medium paper production line pm and related facilities to enhance production capacity to  tonnes year for an estimated cost of million 
we estimate that total capital expenditure in the years of and to be approximately million  which is expected to be funded by debt financing  cash on hand and cash flows generated from our own operations 
our cash and cash equivalents was  as of december   and cash flows generated from our own operations amounted to approximately million in acquisition of land in the spring of  we initiated the process of acquiring approximately  square meters of land adjacent to our xushui paper mill facilities and have received governmental approval for our capacity expansion plan 
however  since the start of the acquisition process  we have met significant opposition by certain local residents over the price that we offered for their land 
on april   we closed our acquisition of  square meters of land and secured all associated land use right permits 
for the  square meters of land acquired  we paid a total of million for various compensation  taxes  and recording fees to the sellers and the local government 
relocation of facilities we have been informed that a recent xushui county urban redevelopment plan mandates that the current site of our headquarters compound and its neighboring area be reserved for residential use only and that  like other manufacturers in the covered area  we will be required to eventually cease all operations currently conducted on our headquarters compound site 
in order to comply with this government mandate  we intend to initiate the process of relocating our offices and facilities to a new site

the two production lines  each having  tonnes year capacity  will be designated as pm and pm upon completion 
total estimated cost of the tissue paper project may be up to million in the next two years 
renovation of pm to expand to  tonnes year corrugating medium capacity we have decided to take voluntary action to renovate our  tonnes year corrugating medium pm in anticipation of increased regulatory concerns on energy efficiencies and to further upgrade the quality of our corrugating medium products 
the renovation is set to start before the end of the first quarter of and there will be no production output from pm during renovation 
the company expects the renovated pm will cost approximately million and will come online in the third quarter of with an expanded capacity of  tonnes year 
the company currently does not have any plans for equity financing in the next months

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risk while our reporting currency is the us dollar  almost all of our consolidated revenues and consolidated costs and expenses are denominated in rmb 
all of our assets are denominated in rmb except for some cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivables 
as a result  we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our revenues and results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between us dollar and rmb 
if the rmb depreciates against the us dollar  the value of our rmb revenues  earnings and assets as expressed in our us dollar financial statements will decline 
we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign exchange risk 
inflation although we are generally able to pass along minor incremental cost inflation to our customers  inflationary factors such as increases in the costs of our products and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results 
we do not believe that inflation in china has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date  a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling and distribution  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling prices of our products do not increase to cope with these increased costs
