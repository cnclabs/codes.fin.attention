table of contents note regarding use of non gaap financial measures the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
these gaap financial statements include i unrealized non cash adjustments and reclassifications  which can be significant  as a result of accounting requirements and elections made under accounting pronouncements relating to derivative instruments and hedging and ii other charges the company believes are not indicative of its ongoing operational performance 
as a result  the company also provides financial information in this filing that was not prepared in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to the information prepared in accordance with gaap 
the company provides supplemental non gaap financial information  including results that it refers to as economic  which the company s management utilizes to evaluate its ongoing financial performance and which the company believes provides greater transparency to investors as supplemental information to its gaap results 
the company s economic financial results differ from gaap results in that they only include the actual cash settlements from fuel hedge contracts all reflected within fuel and oil expense in the period of settlement 
thus  fuel and oil expense on an economic basis reflects the company s actual net cash outlays for fuel during the applicable period  inclusive of settled fuel derivative contracts 
any net premium costs paid related to option contracts are reflected as a component of other gains losses  net  for both gaap and non gaap including economic purposes in the period of contract settlement 
these economic results provide a better measure of the impact of the company s fuel hedges on its operating performance and liquidity since they exclude the unrealized  non cash adjustments and reclassifications that are recorded in gaap results in accordance with accounting guidance relating to derivative instruments  and they reflect all cash settlements related to fuel derivative contracts within fuel and oil expense 
this enables the company s management  as well as investors  to consistently assess the company s operating performance on a year over year or quarter over quarter basis after considering all efforts in place to manage fuel expense 
however  because these measures are not determined in accordance with gaap  the measures are susceptible to varying calculations and not all companies calculate the measures in the same manner 
as a result  the aforementioned measures  as presented  may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 
further information on i the company s fuel hedging program  ii the requirements of accounting for derivative instruments  and iii the causes of hedge ineffectiveness and or mark to market gains or losses from derivative instruments is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition to its economic financial measures  as defined above  the company has also provided other non gaap financial measures as a result of items that the company believes are not indicative of its ongoing operations 
these include   and charges of million  million  and million  respectively  before the impact of profitsharing and or taxes related to expenses associated with the company s acquisition and integration of airtran  and a charge of million before the impact of profitsharing and or taxes for an asset impairment related to the company s decision not to equip its classic aircraft with required navigation performance rnp capabilities 
the company believes that evaluation of its financial performance compared to prior and future periods can be enhanced by a presentation of results that exclude the impact of these items 
as a result of the company s acquisition of airtran  which closed on may   the company has incurred and expects to continue to incur substantial charges associated with integration of the two companies 
while the company cannot predict the exact timing or amounts of these charges  it does expect to treat the charges as special items in its future presentation of non gaap results

operating income for was million  which was a percent decrease versus on a non gaap basis  the company s operating income was million  which was relatively flat compared to see the previous note regarding use of non gaap financial measures 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  for gaap reporting  the accompanying results of operations and cash flows contain airtran s results beginning as of the date of the acquisition  while results of operations and cash flows prior to the acquisition date are only the results of southwest 
the company has implemented  and or is in the midst of  several strategic initiatives that are intended to increase its revenues and reduce its unit costs  and to aid the company with its goal of achieving pre tax return on invested capital of percent 
the company s five major strategic initiatives include the integration of airtran 
the acquisition of airtan increased the company s fleet size by aircraft and expanded the company s network into key us markets such as atlanta and washington reagan  and near international locations such as the caribbean and mexico 
the company has been able to produce significant synergies to date and continues to expect net pre tax annual synergies of million in excluding acquisition and integration expenses 
significant changes have been made and are underway to airtran s route network  including the closure of several airports that proved unsustainable  and the re deployment of aircraft in new markets 
in addition  during the first quarter of  the company obtained a single operating certificate from the faa 
the company has also continued the process of transferring airtran aircraft to southwest to be converted to the southwest livery 
as of january   airtran aircraft had completed the conversion process and re entered service as southwest aircraft 
in addition  the company converted several airtran airport facilities to southwest in and plans to continue converting the remainder of airtran s airport facilities to southwest 
southwest s all new rapid rewards frequent flyer program 
the results of the program have exceeded the company s expectations with respect to the number of new frequent flyer members  the amount spent per member on airfare  the number of flights taken by members  the number of southwest s co branded chase visa credit card holders added  the number of points sold to business partners  and the number of frequent flyer points purchased by program members 
fleet modernization 
the company entered into an agreement in to be the launch customer for boeing s new  more fuel efficient max aircraft  which is expected to enter service in the company placed firm orders for boeing max aircraft and also added boeing ng aircraft to its existing firm order book at that time 
the max is expected to reduce co emissions and improve fuel burn by an additional to percent over today s most fuel efficient  single aisle airplane 
in january  the company also announced its plans to retrofit its fleet with an updated cabin interior 
evolve the new southwest experience is intended to enhance customer comfort  personal space  and the overall travel experience  while improving fleet efficiency and being environmentally responsible 
by maximizing the space inside the plane  evolve allows for the added benefit of six additional seats on each aircraft  along with more climate friendly and cost effective materials 
these retrofits for southwest aircraft began in march and are expected to be completed in airtran aircraft that are transitioned to the southwest fleet are also expected to receive the new evolve interior 
as of january   of the company s aircraft had been converted to the evolve interior  including transitioned airtran aircraft 
the company has also made the decision to retrofit of its fleet with evolve  which it also expects to complete in the addition of a larger aircraft  the boeing  to southwest s fleet 
to further support its fleet modernization efforts  the company received a total of boeing s during the boeing i is better suited for potential new destinations  including near international locations  ii provides the company with the opportunity to generate additional revenue by replacing current aircraft on specified routes and locations that are restricted due to space constraints or slot controls a slot is the right of an air carrier  pursuant to regulations of the faa  to operate a takeoff or landing at 
table of contents a specific time at certain airports  and iii operates at a lower unit cost than aircraft in the company s existing fleet 
new reservation system and international capabilities 
the company has entered into a contract with amadeus it group to implement amadeus altea reservations solution to support the company s international service 
the amadeus technology is expected to support southwest s operation of international flights  which are expected to begin in the contract also provides the option for southwest to migrate its domestic business to amadeus in the future 
in addition  during fourth quarter  the company announced incremental revenue initiatives designed to increase revenues during and future periods 
the company announced that it will increase the amount customers pay for its early bird product from per one way ticket to per one way ticket  effective by the end of the first quarter of the company also announced  beginning in february  it will increase the fees charged for certain checked baggage 
on airtran flights  the charge for a customer s first checked bag will increase to  and second checked bag will cost on southwest flights  a customer will still be able to check up to two bags  up to pounds each  free of charge  but the charge for a third or subsequent checked bag  or for any bag in excess of pounds  will increase to each 
southwest also plans to tighten the flexibility associated with its most restrictive tickets 
currently  customers that don t show up for their scheduled flight retain the full value paid for their tickets and can reuse such funds for up to a year after the original flight date 
at some point during  the company plans to implement a service charge for a customer to reuse the full value paid for such tickets unless that customer calls ahead and cancels or re books their ticket prior to the originally scheduled flight time 
one of the company s goals in making such a change is to change customers behavior by having them call ahead and cancel or re book their flight  which would enable the company to then attempt to re sell that empty seat prior to the flight departure 
during january  the company began selling open premium boarding positions systemwide at the gate for a charge per flight 
the company has continued working towards creating connecting capabilities between the southwest and airtran reservations systems to allow customers to book connecting itineraries between the two carriers 
full deployment of connecting capabilities is expected to occur in early during  the company continued to optimize and align the southwest and airtran networks  launched booking tools to allow customers of both airlines to book flights on either carrier via southwest 
com or airtran 
com  and continued to work on integrating the frequent flyer programs of the carriers 
the efforts underway to fully integrate airtran s network and schedule with southwest s are expected to be a multi year undertaking  but one that the company believes will yield significant financial benefits 
during  the company also continued its progress towards integrating southwest s and airtran s unionized workforce 
southwest s aircraft mechanics  represented by the aircraft mechanics fraternal association amfa  and the aircraft mechanics and inspectors at airtran  represented by the international brotherhood of teamsters  local ibt  voted to ratify their seniority integration agreement  which integrates the two groups seniority lists 
further  the international association of machinists and aerospace workers  afl cio iam  which represents the customer service agents and customer representatives at both southwest and airtran  reached a decision regarding the methodology for integrating the seniority lists of the two workgroups 
the decision by iam was not subject to a vote by the respective workgroups 
in addition  a settlement agreement was reached for integrating the seniority lists of material specialists at southwest and airtran 
as a result of these agreements  all southwest and airtran union workgroup seniority integration methodologies have now been resolved 
the company s pilots  flight attendants  flight instructors  dispatchers  and ramp  operations  provisioning  and freight agents have also successfully completed the seniority integration negotiation process 
as discussed above  the company currently believes the acquisition of airtran has the potential to yield net annual synergies of approximately million in  not including acquisition and integration costs 
the company incurred acquisition and integration expenses of million in and million in and is expected to incur no more than million in total acquisition and integration costs 
in addition  although southwest and airtran are currently operated separately in many respects  their networks remain complementary 
table of contents with little route overlap 
strategically  both carriers place an emphasis on outstanding customer service  high quality low cost operations  solid low fare brands  and strong employee cultures 
at the current time  the company plans to continue its route network and schedule optimization efforts  but does not intend to grow its overall fleet size for the company currently expects to receive aircraft deliveries during  all of which will be new aircraft from boeing 
the company also expects to retire some of its older s and s  as well as transition a number of s out of service as part of the company s lease sublease agreement with delta

the company s gaap results for both years ended december  and were significantly impacted by the non cash adjustments recorded as a result of the company s portfolio of derivative contracts utilized to hedge against jet fuel price volatility  as well as acquisition and integration costs associated with the company s acquisition of airtran 
as a result of the fuel hedges the company had in place during including those that settled during and those that will settle in future years the company recognized a net total of million in gains allocated between fuel and oil expense and other gains losses  net  in the consolidated statement of income 
during  the company recognized a net total of million in losses as a result of its fuel hedging activities  allocated between fuel and oil expense and other gains losses  net 
each of these totals for and include the net premium costs the company paid to enter into a portion of its fuel derivative instruments such as option contracts which are classified as a component of other gains losses  net 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on fuel hedging and note for further information on the acquisition of airtran 
in addition  the company s gaap results for the year ended december  included a million third quarter charge associated with the company s agreement with delta and boeing capital corp 
to lease or sublease all of airtran s boeing s to delta 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on this transaction 
the company s gaap results for the year ended december  included an asset impairment related to the company s decision not to equip its classic aircraft with required navigation performance rnp capabilities 
excluding the impact of these items  the company s net income on a non gaap basis increased percent for the year ended compared to this increase primarily was a result of better revenue production  which more than offset higher operating costs 
operating revenues operating revenues for increased by billion  or percent  compared to the majority of the increase was due to the fact that results include the full year of airtran operating revenues  while results only include airtran operating revenues following the may  acquisition date 
for the full year  other than due to the inclusion of months of activity versus only eight months in  airtran s standalone operating revenues did not otherwise have a significant impact on the company s consolidated results 
excluding the results of airtran in both periods  operating revenues for increased percent on a dollar basis  compared to  primarily due to a percent increase in passenger revenues 
holding other factors constant  over percent of the increase in passenger revenues was attributable to higher passenger yields passenger revenues per rpm flown  as the company implemented fare increases in an attempt to buffer a portion of the impact of higher fuel costs 
in addition to the fare increases the company has been able to implement and other revenue management techniques  the year over year increase in passenger revenues benefitted from continued optimization of the company s flight schedule to better match demand in certain markets and  at certain times  targeted marketing campaigns in which the company differentiates its products and services from competitors 
these increases were partially offset by a slight decrease in southwest s load factor  partially due to the impact of higher airfares on customer demand 
based on bookings and revenue trends  thus far  the company expects a solid year over year increase in its first quarter passenger unit revenues 

table of contents freight revenues for increased by million  or percent  compared to  primarily due to an increase in shipments as a result of better domestic economic conditions than the prior year 
the company currently expects freight revenues for first quarter to be in line with fourth quarter freight revenues 
other revenues for increased by million  or percent  compared to  of which approximately million was due to the inclusion of the full year of airtran results in  while results only include airtran other revenues following the acquisition date 
excluding the results of airtran in both periods  other revenues were relatively stable compared to  as an increase in revenues from initiatives  such as the company s earlybird product  for which customers pay a service charge to automatically receive an assigned boarding position before general checkin begins  and service charges for pets was offset by an increase in the portion of the commissions earned from programs the company sponsors with certain business partners that were classified as passenger revenues as opposed to other revenues 
the classification of such amounts is influenced by average fares  among other factors 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on southwest s frequent flyer program 
southwest s earlybird product and service charges for unaccompanied minors  pets  and excess bags contributed million to other revenues in versus million generated from these products during other revenues for included approximately million in baggage fees collected from airtran customers  versus approximately million for the company currently expects other revenues in first quarter to be in line with first quarter other revenues 
operating expenses operating expenses for increased by billion  or percent  compared to  while capacity increased percent compared to the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the inclusion of airtran results for the full year  while results only include airtran operating expenses following the acquisition date 
historically  except for changes in the price of fuel  changes in operating expenses for airlines are largely driven by changes in capacity  or asms

excluding the results of airtran in both periods  salaries  wages  and benefits expense increased percent on a dollar basis for compared to approximately percent of this year over year increase was a result of higher salaries expense and approximately percent was a result of higher employee benefits expense  both primarily due to an increase in active full time equivalent employees 
in addition  approximately percent of the increase was due to an increase in profitsharing expense resulting from higher income available for profitsharing 
the company s profitsharing expense is based on profits that exclude the unrealized gains and or losses the company records for its fuel hedging program as well as acquisition and integration costs

the company s operating income of million was lower than the company s operating income of million  as the percent increase in operating expenses outpaced the percent increase in operating revenues 
operating revenues consolidated operating revenues for increased by billion  or percent  compared to  of which approximately billion was attributable to the inclusion of the results of airtran following the may  acquisition 
consolidated passenger revenues for increased by billion  or percent  compared to  of which approximately billion was due to the inclusion of airtran results following the may  acquisition 
excluding the results of airtran  operating revenues for increased percent on a dollar basis  compared to  primarily due to a percent increase in passenger revenues 
holding other factors constant  over percent of the increase in passenger revenues was attributable to the percent increase in southwest s capacity  versus the remainder of the increase primarily was due to higher passenger yields passenger revenues per rpm flown  as the company implemented fare increases in an attempt to buffer a portion of the impact of higher fuel costs 
the company s load factor for also increased points to percent in  which was a record for the company 
these strong revenue results were achieved due to better revenue management techniques and strategies  continued optimization of the company s flight schedule to better match demand in certain markets  improving economic conditions  which led to higher demand for air travel versus  and at times  targeted marketing campaigns in which the company differentiated its product and service from competitors 
consolidated freight revenues for increased by million  or percent  versus  primarily due to higher average rates charged as a result of fuel surcharges and better economic conditions than the prior year 
consolidated other revenues for increased by million  or percent  compared to  of which approximately million was due to the inclusion of airtran results following the may  acquisition date 
excluding the results of airtran  other revenues increased percent on a dollar basis  compared to this increase was due to revenues from initiatives  such as the company s earlybird product  for which customers could pay to automatically receive an assigned boarding position before general checkin begins  and service charges for unaccompanied minors and pets 
the increase in revenues from initiatives was partially offset by a year over year increase in the portion of the commissions earned from programs the company sponsors with certain business partners that were classified as passenger revenue 
the classification of such amounts is influenced by average fares  among other factors

an increase in acquisition and integration expenses incurred by southwest of million also contributed to the year over year increase in costs on both a dollar and a per asm basis during on a non gaap basis  the company s consolidated operating expenses per asm  excluding fuel  remained relatively flat compared to consolidated salaries  wages  and benefits expense for increased by million  or percent  compared to  of which approximately million was due to the inclusion of airtran results following the may  acquisition date 
excluding the results of airtran  salaries  wages  and benefits expense increased percent on a dollar basis for compared to the majority of the year over year increase was due to the increase in southwest s capacity and number of trips flown  which was partially offset by a decrease in profitsharing expense resulting from lower income available for profitsharing 
the company s profitsharing expense is based on profits that exclude the unrealized gains and or losses the company records for its fuel hedging program as well as acquisition and integration costs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on fuel hedging 
consolidated salaries  wages  and benefits expense per asm for decreased percent compared to the majority of this decrease on a per asm basis was due to airtran unit costs for salaries  wages  and benefits being significantly lower than southwest s 
this decrease was partially offset by increases in average wage rates paid to the majority of southwest s workforce

consolidated maintenance  materials  and repairs expense for increased by million  or percent  compared to  of which approximately million was due to the inclusion of airtran results following the may  acquisition date 
excluding the results of airtran  maintenance materials and repairs expense for increased percent on a dollar basis compared to this increase primarily was attributable to higher airframe expense associated with routine heavy maintenance checks 
on a per asm basis  consolidated maintenance materials and repairs expense increased percent primarily as a result of higher engine expense  as airtran s boeing fleet has higher engine costs  on a flight hour basis  than southwest s all boeing fleet 
in october  the company amended its engine maintenance contracts with ge engine services 
previously  the engines on both its classic fleet s and its s were subject to power by the hour agreements under which the cost was based on the number of engine hours flown 
the amended agreement for the classic fleet no longer meets the risk transfer criteria of a power by the hour agreement  and thus expense will prospectively be recorded on a time and materials basis when an engine repair event takes place 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on this change 
the maintenance contract for the engines on the company s fleet was amended primarily to incorporate the boeing s from the airtran acquisition and  bring them on to the southwest maintenance program  extend the term of that agreement until december  the amendments to both maintenance contracts were effective october  consolidated aircraft rentals expense for increased by million  or percent  compared to there was an increase of approximately million due to the inclusion of airtran results following the may  acquisition date

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding the impact of this amortization  year over year expense decreased slightly on a dollar basis 
consolidated aircraft rentals expense per asm for increased percent compared to this increase on a per asm basis primarily was due to the fact that airtran leases the majority of its aircraft fleet

on a per asm basis compared to  consolidated landing fees and other rentals expense decreased by percent 
the decline on a per asm basis primarily was due to higher than anticipated credits refunds received in as a result of airports audits of prior period payments

liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was billion in  compared to billion provided by operating activities in operating cash inflows primarily are derived from providing air transportation to customers 
the vast majority of tickets are purchased prior to the day on which travel is provided and  in some cases  several months before the anticipated travel date 
operating cash outflows primarily are related to the recurring expenses of airline operations 
operating cash flows can also be significantly impacted by the company s fuel hedge positions and the significant fluctuation in fair value of those positions and the corresponding cash collateral requirements associated with those positions 
in the consolidated statement of cash flows  increases and or decreases to these cash deposits are reflected in operating cash flows as cash collateral received from provided to fuel derivative counterparties 
as of december   there was no cash either held from or provided to fuel hedge counterparties  so the net change in cash deposits for was a net operating inflow of million 
cash flows associated with entering into new fuel derivatives  which are also classified as other  net  operating cash flows  were net inflows of million in  net inflows of million in  and net outflows of million in cash flows from operating activities for were also significantly impacted by the company s net income as adjusted for non cash depreciation and amortization expense and non cash unrealized losses on fuel derivative instruments

see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the issuance and redemption of long term debt 
the company has a large net deferred tax liability on its consolidated balance sheet 
the deferral of income taxes has resulted in a significant benefit to the company and its liquidity position 
since the company purchases the majority of the aircraft it acquires  it has been able to utilize accelerated depreciation methods including bonus depreciation available under the internal revenue code in and in previous years  which has enabled the company to defer the cash tax payments associated with these depreciable assets to future years 
based on the company s scheduled future aircraft deliveries from boeing and existing tax laws in effect  the 
table of contents company will continue to defer significant cash income taxes to future years 
the company has in the past and will continue in the future to pay significant cash taxes to the various taxing jurisdictions where it operates 
the company expects to be able to continue to meet such obligations utilizing cash and investments on hand  as well as cash generated from its ongoing operations 
off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations  and contingent liabilities and commitments the company has contractual obligations and commitments primarily with regard to future purchases of aircraft  payment of debt  and lease arrangements 
the company received boeing aircraft in  of which were new aircraft purchased from boeing and five of which were leased from a third party 
the company also retired older leased and owned and aircraft from service during under the company s agreement with boeing  it has the option to substitute s for the s ordered with at least months notice prior to the contractual delivery date and can substitute s for the s with at least twelve months notice 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a complete table of the company s firm orders  options  and purchase rights with boeing 
for aircraft commitments with boeing  the company is required to make cash deposits toward the purchase of aircraft in advance 
these deposits are classified as deposits on flight equipment purchase contracts in the consolidated balance sheet until the aircraft is delivered  at which time deposits previously made are deducted from the final purchase price of the aircraft and are reclassified as flight equipment 
the leasing of aircraft including the sale and leaseback of aircraft provides flexibility to the company as a source of financing 
although the company is responsible for all maintenance  insurance  and expense associated with operating leased aircraft  and retains the risk of loss for these aircraft  it has not made guarantees to the lessors regarding the residual value or market value of the aircraft at the end of the lease terms 
as of december   the company operated leased aircraft  of which are under operating leases 
as prescribed by gaap  assets and obligations under operating leases are not included in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
disclosure of the contractual obligations associated with the company s leased aircraft is included below as well as in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company is required to provide standby letters of credit to support certain obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business 
although the letters of credit are off balance sheet  the majority of obligations to which they relate are reflected as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
outstanding letters of credit totaled million at december  the company is a well known seasoned issuer and has an effective shelf registration statement registering an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future sales 
the company intends to use the proceeds from any future securities sales off this shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes 
the company has not issued any securities under this shelf registration statement to date 
the company also has an million unsecured revolving credit facility  which provides flexibility in the company s cash management and planning activities

firm orders from boeing 
the company has flexibility as to the timing for certain of the firm orders in through  but has classified the amounts in the earliest year they could be considered a commitment 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company expects to incur substantial integration and closing costs associated with the acquisition of airtran  a portion of which were incurred in   and and which have been  and are expected to continue to be  funded with cash 
the company believes that its current liquidity position  including unrestricted cash and short term investments of billion as of december   anticipated future internally generated funds from operations  and its fully available  unsecured revolving credit facility of million  will enable it to meet these future integration expenditures 
the company will continue to consider various borrowing or leasing options to maximize liquidity and supplement cash requirements as needed 
the company believes it has access to financing arrangements because of its current investment grade credit ratings  unencumbered assets  modest leverage  and consistent profitability  which should enable it to meet its ongoing capital  operating  and other liquidity requirements 
as of december   the book value of the company s unencumbered aircraft totaled approximately billion 
in january  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s common stock 
through february   the company had repurchased million shares for a total of approximately million  at which time repurchases under the program were suspended 
on august   the company s board of directors authorized the company to resume a share repurchase program and approved the company s repurchase  on a discretionary basis  of up to million of the company s common stock following such authorization 
on may   the company s board of directors increased the previous share repurchase authorization by an additional million 
during  the company purchased approximately million shares of its common stock for approximately million  which brings its cumulative purchases under this program since the august authorization to approximately million shares for approximately million of the billion in total authorized by the board 
repurchases are made in accordance with applicable securities laws in the open market or in private transactions from time to time  depending on market conditions  and may be discontinued at any time 
during  the city of dallas approved the love field modernization program lfmp  a project to reconstruct dallas love field airport with modern  convenient air travel facilities 
pursuant to a program development agreement pda with the city of dallas and the love field airport modernization corporation or 
table of contents lfamc  a texas non profit local government corporation established by the city to act on the city s behalf to facilitate the development of the lfmp  the company is managing this project 
although subject to change  the project is expected to include the renovation of the airport airline terminals and complete replacement of gate facilities with a new gate facility  including infrastructure  systems and equipment  aircraft parking apron  fueling system  roadways and terminal curbside  baggage handling systems  passenger loading bridges and support systems  and other supporting infrastructure 
major construction commenced during new ticketing and checkin areas opened during fourth quarter and new gates and new concession areas are expected to open in second quarter full completion of the project is scheduled for second half of during fourth quarter  the lfamc issued million in tax exempt facility revenue bonds lfmp bonds  the proceeds of which have been or will be used to finance a significant portion of the ongoing costs of the lfmp  and to reimburse the company for approximately million in early lfmp expenditures made such expenditures and reimbursement were authorized pursuant to a june  inducement resolution approved by the dallas city council and subsequent resolutions by the lfamc 
repayment of the lfmp bonds will be through the facilities payments described below 
reimbursement of the company for its payment of facilities payments are expected to be made through recurring ground rents  fees  and other revenues collected at the airport 
an additional tranche of such bonds totaling million was issued during second quarter the company has guaranteed principal  premium  and interest on the issued bonds 
it is currently expected that the total amount spent on the lfmp project will be approximately million 
the company currently expects that no further bond issuances will be required to complete the lfmp project 
prior to the issuance of the lfmp bonds by the lfamc  the company entered into two separate funding agreements a facilities agreement pursuant to which the company is obligated to make debt service payments on the principal and interest amounts associated with the lfmp bonds facilities payments  less other sources of funds the city of dallas may apply to the repayment of the lfmp bonds including but not limited to passenger facility charges collected from passengers originating from the airport  and a revenue credit agreement pursuant to which the city of dallas will reimburse the company for the facilities payments made by the company 
a majority of the monies transferred from the city of dallas to the company under the revenue credit agreement are expected to originate from a reimbursement account created in the use and lease agreement between the city of dallas and the company 
the use and lease agreement is a year agreement providing for  among other things  the company s lease of space at the airport from the city of dallas 
the remainder of such monies transferred from the city of dallas to the company under the revenue credit agreement is expected to originate from use and lease agreements with other airlines  various concession agreements  and other airport miscellaneous revenues 
the company s liquidity could be impacted by the lfmp to the extent there are timing differences between the company s payment of the facilities payments pursuant to the facilities agreement and the transfer of monies back to the company pursuant to the revenue credit agreement  however  the company does not currently expect that to occur 
the lfmp is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s capital resources or financial position 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information and accounting requirements related to the lfmp 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
the company s estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and changes in the business environment 
however  actual results may differ from estimates under different 
table of contents conditions  sometimes materially 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that both i are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and ii require management s most subjective judgments 
the company s most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
revenue recognition tickets sold for passenger air travel are initially deferred as air traffic liability 
passenger revenue is recognized and air traffic liability is reduced when the service is provided ie  when the flight takes place 
air traffic liability primarily represents tickets sold for future travel dates and estimated future refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel dates 
the balance in air traffic liability  which includes a portion of the company s liability associated with its frequent flyer program  fluctuates throughout the year based on seasonal travel patterns  fare sale activity  and activity associated with the company s frequent flyer programs 
for air travel on southwest  the amount of tickets that will expire unused are estimated and recognized in passenger revenue once the scheduled flight date has passed 
estimating the amount of tickets that will expire unused  be refunded  or exchanged involves some level of subjectivity and judgment 
the majority of southwest s tickets sold are nonrefundable  which is the primary source of unused tickets 
according to southwest s contract of carriage  tickets whether refundable or nonrefundable that are sold but not flown on the travel date can be reused for another flight  up to a year from the date of sale  or can be refunded if the ticket is refundable 
this policy also applies to unused customer funds that may be left over from exchanging a less expensive ticket for a previously purchased ticket that was more expensive 
a small percentage of tickets or partial tickets expire unused 
fully refundable tickets are rarely forfeited 
estimates of tickets that will expire unused are based on historical experience over many years 
southwest and other airlines have consistently applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from unused tickets at the date of scheduled travel 
holding other factors constant  a percent change in the company s estimate of the amount of tickets that will expire unused would have resulted in a million  or percent  change in passenger revenues recognized for events and circumstances outside of historical fare sale activity or historical customer travel patterns can result in actual refunds  exchanges  or forfeited tickets differing significantly from estimates 
the company evaluates its estimates within a narrow range of acceptable amounts 
if actual refunds  exchanges  or forfeiture experience results in an amount outside of this range  estimates and assumptions are reviewed and adjustments to air traffic liability and to passenger revenue are recorded  as necessary 
additional factors that may affect estimated refunds and exchanges include  but may not be limited to  changes to the company s ticketing policies  the company s refund  exchange  and unused funds policies  the mix of refundable and nonrefundable fares  promotional fare activity  and the impact of the economic environment on customer behavior 
the company s estimation techniques have been consistently applied from year to year  however  as with any estimates  actual refund  exchange  and forfeiture activity may vary from estimated amounts 
the company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for future refunds  exchanges  and forfeited tickets would be reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made 
accounting for long lived assets flight equipment and related assets make up the majority of the company s long lived assets 
flight equipment primarily relates to the boeing aircraft and boeing aircraft in the company s fleet at december   which are either owned or on capital lease 
the remaining boeing aircraft and boeing aircraft in the company s fleet at december   are operated under operating leases 
in accounting for long lived assets  the company must make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets  the expected residual values of the assets  and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and their future expected cash flows 

table of contents the following table shows a breakdown of the company s long lived asset groups along with information about estimated useful lives and residual values for new assets generally purchased from the manufacturer estimated useful life estimated residual value airframes and engines to years aircraft parts fleet life ground property and equipment to years in estimating the lives and expected residual values of its aircraft  the company primarily has relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types  current and projected future market information  and recommendations from boeing 
aircraft estimated useful lives are based on the number of cycles flown one take off and landing as well as the aircraft age 
the company has made a conversion of cycles into years based on both historical and anticipated future utilization of the aircraft 
subsequent revisions to these estimates  which can be significant  could be caused by changes to aircraft maintenance programs  changes in utilization of the aircraft actual cycles during a given period of time  governmental regulations on aging aircraft  and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types 
the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions each reporting period and  when warranted  adjusts these estimates and assumptions 
generally  these adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation and amortization expense 
for example  during fourth quarter  and again in third quarter  the company changed the estimated residual values of its entire remaining fleet of owned and aircraft 
based on current and expected future market conditions related to these aircraft  as well as a significant change in the way the company expects to utilize the fleet  the company reduced the residual values of these aircraft 
this fleet originally had residual values of approximately percent of original cost  but based on current estimates  now has residual values of approximately two percent of original cost 
this determination was made based on the continuous assessment of the market for these older aircraft  as many buyers of used aircraft prefer newer  more fuel efficient models  and the increase in the number of airlines retiring these older aircraft  which has increased the supply of older aircraft on the market 
as this reduction in residual value is considered a change in estimate  it was accounted for on a prospective basis  and thus the company has effectively accelerated the recording of depreciation expense over the remainder of the useful lives for each aircraft in each instance 
the company does not believe these changes in estimates towards the end of the useful lives for a given fleet type are unusual  especially given the rapid pace of technological advancement  volatile fuel prices  and recent significant transactions involving the company s fleet 
the reduction in estimated salvage value resulted in a million increase in depreciation expense during the second half of the year  and is expected to increase expense by approximately million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
the company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment 
factors that would indicate potential impairment may include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of the long lived asset s  a significant change in the long lived asset s physical condition  and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the long lived asset 
the company has continued to operate virtually all of its aircraft  generate positive cash flow  and produce operating profits 
consequently  the company has not identified any impairment related to its existing aircraft fleet 
the company will continue to monitor its long lived assets and the airline operating environment 
the company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for expected lives  expected residual values  and impairment evaluations would be made or reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made 

table of contents financial derivative instruments the company utilizes financial derivative instruments primarily to manage its risk associated with changing jet fuel prices 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for more information on these risk management activities  and see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the company s fuel hedging program and financial derivative instruments 
all derivatives are required to be reflected at fair value and recorded on the consolidated balance sheet 
at december   the company was a party to over  separate financial derivative instruments  related to its fuel hedging program  for the years through changes in the fair values of these instruments can vary dramatically based on changes in the underlying commodity prices  as has been evident in recent years 
for example  during  market spot prices for west texas intermediate crude oil peaked at a high of approximately per barrel and hit a low price of approximately per barrel 
during  market spot prices ranged from a high of per barrel to a low of per barrel 
market price changes can be driven by factors such as supply and demand  inventory levels  weather events  refinery capacity  political agendas  value of the us dollar  geopolitical events  and general economic conditions  among other items 
the financial derivative instruments utilized by the company primarily are a combination of collars  purchased call options  call spreads  and fixed price swap agreements 
the company does not purchase or hold any derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the company enters into financial derivative instruments with third party institutions in over the counter markets 
since the majority of the company s financial derivative instruments are not traded on a market exchange  the company estimates their fair values 
depending on the type of instrument  the values are determined by the use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets 
also  since there is not a reliable forward market for jet fuel  the company must estimate the future prices of jet fuel in order to measure the effectiveness of the hedging instruments in offsetting changes to those prices 
forward jet fuel prices are estimated through the observation of similar commodity futures prices such as crude oil  heating oil  and unleaded gasoline and adjusted based on variations of those like commodities to the company s ultimate expected price to be paid for jet fuel at the specific locations in which the company hedges 
fair values for financial derivative instruments and forward jet fuel prices are estimated prior to the time that the financial derivative instruments settle and the time that jet fuel is purchased and consumed  respectively 
however  once settlement of the financial derivative instruments occurs and the hedged jet fuel is purchased and consumed  all values and prices are known and are recognized in the financial statements 
in some historical periods  because of increased volatility in energy markets  the company has in fact lost hedge accounting for a certain type of commodity  such as all unleaded gasoline derivative instruments 
there have also been instances in which the company has lost hedge accounting in specific geographic locations for certain types of commodities used in hedging 
at such times  the company has marked all such derivatives to fair value in each quarterly period  with all changes in value reflected as a component of other gains losses  net in the consolidated statement of income 
the company did not lose hedge accounting for an entire commodity during   or although the company s prospective assessment has been utilized to ensure that the commodities used in most cases still qualify for hedge accounting in specific locations where the company hedges  there are no assurances that these commodities will continue to qualify in the future 
this is due to the fact that future price changes in these refined products may not be consistent with historical price changes 
increased volatility in these commodity markets for an extended period of time  especially if such volatility were to worsen  could cause the company to lose hedge accounting altogether for the commodities used in its fuel hedging program  which would create further volatility in the company s financial results 
estimating the fair value of these fuel derivative instruments and forward prices for jet fuel will also result in changes in their fair values from period to period and thus determine their accounting treatment 
to the extent that the change in the estimated fair value of a fuel derivative instrument differs from the change in the estimated price of the associated jet fuel to be purchased  both on a cumulative and a period to period basis  ineffectiveness 
table of contents of the fuel hedge can result 
this could result in the immediate recording of non cash charges or income  representing the change in the fair value of the derivative  even though the derivative instrument may not expire settle until a future period 
likewise  if a derivative contract ceases to qualify for hedge accounting  the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument is recorded every period to other gains and losses  net in the consolidated statement of income in the period of the change 
ineffectiveness is inherent in hedging jet fuel with derivative positions based in other crude oil related commodities  especially given the past volatility in the prices of refined products 
due to the volatility in markets for crude oil and related products  the company is unable to predict the amount of ineffectiveness each period  including the loss of hedge accounting  which could be determined on a derivative by derivative basis or in the aggregate for a specific commodity 
this may result  and has historically resulted  in increased volatility in the company s financial statements 
the amount of hedge ineffectiveness and unrealized gains and losses on the change in fair value of derivative contracts settling in future periods recorded during historical periods has been due to a number of factors 
these factors include the significant fluctuation in energy prices  the number of derivative positions the company holds  significant weather events that have affected refinery capacity and the production of refined products  and the volatility of the different types of products the company uses for mitigation of fuel price volatility 
the discontinuation of hedge accounting for specific hedges and for specific refined products  such as unleaded gasoline  can also be a result of these factors 
depending on the level at which the company is hedged at any point in time  as the fair value of the company s hedge positions fluctuate in amount from period to period  there could be continued variability recorded in the consolidated statement of income  and furthermore  the amount of hedge ineffectiveness and unrealized gains or losses recorded in earnings may be material 
this is primarily because small differences in the correlation of crude oil related products could be leveraged over large volumes 
the company continually looks for better and more accurate methodologies in forecasting expected future cash flows relating to its jet fuel hedging program 
these estimates are an important component used in the measurement of effectiveness for the company s fuel hedges 
the current methodology used by the company in forecasting forward jet fuel prices is primarily based on the idea that different types of commodities are statistically better predictors of forward jet fuel prices  depending on specific geographic locations in which the company hedges 
the company then adjusts for certain items  such as transportation costs  that are stated in fuel purchasing contracts with its vendors  in order to estimate the actual price paid for jet fuel associated with each hedge 
this methodology for estimating expected future cash flows ie  jet fuel prices has been consistently applied during   and  and has not changed for either assessing or measuring hedge ineffectiveness during these periods 
the company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of financial derivative instruments and forward jet fuel prices would be made or reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made 
fair value measurements the company utilizes unobservable level inputs in determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities 
at december   these included auction rate security investments  valued at million  a portion of its fuel derivative option contracts  which were a net asset of million  and million in other investments 
all of the company s auction rate security instruments are reflected at estimated fair value in the consolidated balance sheet 
in prior periods  due to the auction process which took place every days for most securities  quoted market prices were readily available  which would have qualified as level however  due to events in credit markets beginning during first quarter  the auctions for most of these instruments failed  and  therefore  the company has determined the estimated fair values of these securities utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis or other type of valuation model  which qualify the instruments as level the 
table of contents company s analyses consider  among other items  the collateralization underlying the security investments  the expected future cash flows  including the final maturity  associated with the securities  estimates of the next time the security is expected to have a successful auction or return to full par value  forecasted reset rates based on the london interbank offered rate libor or the issuer s net loan rate  and a counterparty credit spread 
in association with this estimate of fair value  the company has recorded a temporary unrealized decline in fair value of million  with an offsetting entry to aoci 
given the quality and backing of the company s auction rate securities held  the fact that the company has not yet recorded a loss on the sale of any of these instruments  and the fact that it has been able to periodically sell instruments back to the issuer  it believes it can continue to account for the estimated reduction in fair value of its remaining securities as temporary 
these conclusions will also continue to be evaluated and challenged in subsequent periods 
the company currently believes that this temporary decline in fair value is due entirely to liquidity issues  because the underlying assets for the majority of securities are almost entirely backed by the us government 
in addition  these auction rate securities represented less than two percent of the company s total cash  cash equivalents  and investment balance at december   which the company believes allows sufficient time for the auction rate securities to return to full value 
at the time of the first failed auctions during first quarter  the company held a total of million in auction rate securities 
since that time  the company has been able to redeem million of these instruments at par value 
the company determines the fair value of fuel derivative option contracts utilizing an option pricing model based on inputs that are either readily available in public markets  can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets  or are quoted by its counterparties 
in situations where the company obtains inputs via quotes from its counterparties  it verifies the reasonableness of these quotes via similar quotes from another counterparty as of each date for which financial statements are prepared 
the company has consistently applied these valuation techniques in all periods presented and believes it has obtained the most accurate information available for the types of derivative contracts it holds 
due to the fact that certain inputs used in determining estimated fair value of its option contracts are considered unobservable primarily implied volatility  the company has categorized these option contracts as level as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  any changes in fair value of cash flow hedges that are considered to be effective  as defined  are offset within aoci until the period in which the expected future cash flow impacts earnings 
any changes in the fair value of fuel derivatives that are ineffective  as defined  or that do not qualify for hedge accounting  are reflected in earnings within other gains losses  net  in the period of the change 
because the company has extensive historical experience in valuing the derivative instruments it holds  and such experience is continually evaluated against its counterparties each period when such instruments expire and are settled for cash  the company believes it is unlikely that an independent third party would value the company s derivative contracts at a significantly different amount than what is reflected in the company s financial statements 
in addition  the company also has bilateral credit provisions in some of its counterparty agreements  which provide for parties or the company to provide cash collateral when the fair value of fuel derivatives with a single party exceeds certain threshold levels 
since this cash collateral is based on the estimated fair value of the company s outstanding fuel derivative contracts  this provides further validation to the company s estimate of fair values 
frequent flyer accounting southwest and airtran utilize estimates in the recognition of liabilities associated with their respective frequent flyer programs 
these estimates primarily include the liability associated with frequent flyer member account balances that are expected to be redeemed for travel or other products at a future date  and frequent flyer awards or certificates that have been issued  are outstanding  and are expected to be redeemed at a future date 
frequent flyer account balances include points credits earned through flights taken  points sold to customers  or points credits earned through business partners participating in the frequent flyer programs 

table of contents in march  southwest launched its all new rapid rewards frequent flyer program 
under the current program  members earn points for every dollar spent  whereas  under the prior program members earned credits for flight segments flown 
the amount of points earned under the current program is based on the fare and fare class purchased  with higher fare products eg  business select earning more points than lower fare products eg  wanna get away 
each fare class is associated with a points earning multiplier  and points for flights are calculated by multiplying the fare for the flight by the fare class multiplier 
likewise  the amount of points required to be redeemed for a flight is based on the fare and fare class purchased 
however  unlike southwest s previous program  under the current program  i members are able to redeem their points for every available seat  every day  on every flight  with no blackout dates  and ii points do not expire so long as the rapid rewards member has points earning activity during a month time period 
in addition  southwest co branded chase visa credit card holders are able to redeem their points for items other than travel on southwest airlines  such as international flights  cruises  hotel stays  rental cars  gift cards  event tickets  and more 
in addition to earning points for revenue flights and qualifying purchases with rapid rewards partners  rapid rewards members also have the ability to purchase points 
as part of southwest s transition to the current program  southwest did not convert members account balances under the previous program  but is allowing members to continue to redeem those balances for award travel under the prior program rules for a period of time 
at december   the amount of awards and credits issued under the previous program that are expected to be redeemed was not material 
airtran operates its a rewards frequent flyer program  which allows customers the opportunity to earn free roundtrip travel awards or business class upgrades on airtran flights 
a rewards credits are earned through flights  purchases made with an airtran airways a visa card or an airtran a rewards chase visa credit card collectively  the airtran a cards  qualifying car rentals from hertz  purchases from other a rewards partners  and in conjunction with certain marketing promotions 
under certain circumstances  customers may also redeem frequent flyer awards for free travel on other airlines 
both southwest and airtran utilize the incremental cost method of accounting for points and or credits earned through flights taken in their respective frequent flyer programs 
a liability is recorded for the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel as points and or credits are being earned 
the liability recorded represents the total number of points and or credits expected to be redeemed by members  regardless of whether the members may have enough to qualify for a full travel award 
the incremental cost liability is primarily composed of direct passenger costs such as fuel  food  and other operational costs  but does not include any contribution to fixed overhead costs or profit 
at december   southwest and airtran s consolidated incremental cost liability  including both the liability remaining from southwest s previous program and the liability associated with its new frequent flyer program  was approximately million 
southwest and airtran also sell frequent flyer points and or credits and related services to business partners participating in the respective frequent flyer programs 
the majority of the points and or credits sold to business partners are through the southwest co branded chase visa credit card or the airtran a cards 
funds received from the sale of points and or credits associated with these agreements are accounted for under the residual method 
under the residual method  as of december   southwest estimates that percent of the amount received from frequent flyer points sold associated with southwest s co branded chase visa credit card relates to free travel 
this is due to the significant increase in southwest s average fare in recent years  while the average value received from business partners for the purchase of points has remained relatively flat 
therefore  for accounting purposes the company currently assigns no value associated with items such as business partner access to southwest s frequent flyer program population for marketing solicitation purposes  use of the southwest s logo on the co branded chase visa credit cards  and other trademarks  designs  images  etc  of southwest for use in marketing materials 
prior to  the apportioned amount estimated to be associated with free travel as opposed to marketing services had historically ranged from percent to percent 
the estimated amounts associated with free travel are deferred and recognized as passenger revenue when the ultimate free travel awards are flown 
for all points sold to business partners that are expected to expire unused  the company recognizes spoilage in accordance with the redemption method 
for any portion of funds received that is deemed 
table of contents not to be associated with future travel  the company has determined that the period revenue is recognized is the period in which it has fulfilled its obligation under the contract signed with the particular business partner  which is on a monthly or quarterly basis  upon sale  as the related marketing services are performed or provided 
the vast majority of these marketing services consist of the access granted  either monthly or quarterly  to various lists of southwest s frequent flyer members 
the estimated amount that is not associated with free travel is recognized in other revenue in the period earned 
for airtran  percent of amounts received for credits sold is also estimated to relate to free travel and is deferred until the associated travel award is flown 
under its current program  southwest continues to estimate the portion of frequent flyer points that will not be redeemed 
these estimates are based on experience in its previous program and expectations of customer behavior given the rules of the current program 
however  since the current program is still relatively new  these estimates may result in significant future adjustments based on actual experience 
goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of the company s acquisition of airtran on may   the company has reflected goodwill on its consolidated balance sheet in the amount of million at december   representing the excess of the fair value of airtran s assets and liabilities over its book value on the acquisition date 
in addition  the company has recorded other intangible assets totaling approximately million at december   primarily consisting of leasehold rights to airport gates  take off and landing slots at certain domestic slot controlled airports and certain intangible assets recognized as part of the valuation of airtran 
all of the company s intangible assets are  other than goodwill  finite lived and are being amortized over their estimated economic useful lives 
goodwill is not amortized  but will continue to be tested for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist 
the company has selected october st as its annual testing date for goodwill impairment 
the company applies a fair value based methodology in testing the carrying value of goodwill for its one reporting unit 
key assumptions and or estimates made in the company s goodwill impairment test included the following i a long term projection of revenues  expenses  and cash flows  ii an estimated weighted average cost of capital of percent  and iii a tax rate of percent 
the company believes these assumptions are consistent with those a hypothetical market participant would use given circumstances that were present at the time the estimates were made 
however  actual results and amounts may be significantly different from the company s estimates 
future impairment of goodwill may result from changes in assumptions  estimates  or circumstances  some of which are beyond the company s control 
factors which could result in an impairment  holding other assumptions constant  could include  but are not limited to i reduced passenger demand as a result of domestic or global economic conditions  ii higher prices for jet fuel  iii lower fares or passenger yields as a result of increased competition or lower demand  iv a significant increase in future capital expenditure commitments  and v significant disruptions to the company s operations as a result of both internal and external events such as terrorist activities  actual or threatened war  labor actions by employees  or further industry regulation 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has interest rate risk in its floating rate debt obligations and interest rate swaps  commodity price risk in jet fuel required to operate its aircraft fleet  and market risk in the derivatives used to manage its fuel hedging program and in the form of fixed rate debt instruments 
as of december   southwest and airtran operated a total of aircraft under operating and capital leases 
however  except for a small number of aircraft that have lease payments that fluctuate based in part on changes in market interest rates  the remainder of the leases are not considered market sensitive financial instruments and  therefore  are not included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below 
commitments related to leases are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information on the company s accounting for its hedging program and for further details on the company s financial derivative instruments 
hedging the company purchases jet fuel at prevailing market prices  but seeks to manage market risk through execution of a documented hedging strategy 
the company utilizes financial derivative instruments  on both a short term and a long term basis  as a form of insurance against the potential for significant increases in fuel prices 
the company believes there is significant risk in not hedging against the possibility of such fuel price increases 
the company expects to consume approximately billion gallons of jet fuel in based on this anticipated usage  a change in jet fuel prices of just one cent per gallon would impact the company s fuel and oil expense by approximately million for  excluding any impact associated with fuel derivative instruments held 
as of december   the company held a net position of fuel derivative instruments that represented a hedge for a portion of its anticipated jet fuel purchases for each year from through see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
the company may increase or decrease the size of its fuel hedge based on its expectation of future market prices  as well as its perceived exposure to cash collateral requirements contained in the agreements it has signed with various counterparties 
the gross fair value of outstanding financial derivative instruments related to the company s jet fuel market price risk at december   was a net asset of million 
in addition  no cash collateral deposits were provided by or held by the company in connection with these instruments based on their fair value as of december  the fair values of the derivative instruments  depending on the type of instrument  were determined by use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets 
an immediate percent increase or decrease in underlying fuel related commodity prices from the december  for all years from through prices would correspondingly change the fair value of the commodity derivative instruments in place by approximately million 
fluctuations in the related commodity derivative instrument cash flows may change by more or less than this amount based upon further fluctuations in futures prices as well as related income tax effects 
in addition  this does not consider changes in cash collateral provided to or by counterparties  which would fluctuate in an amount equal to or less than this amount  depending on the type of collateral arrangement in place with each counterparty 
this sensitivity analysis uses industry standard valuation models and holds all inputs constant at december  levels  except underlying futures prices 
the company s credit exposure related to fuel derivative instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a net positive fair value to the company 
at such times  these outstanding instruments expose the company to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements 
as of december   the company had eight counterparties in which the derivatives held were a net asset  totaling million 
to manage credit risk  the company selects and will periodically review counterparties based on credit ratings  limits its exposure to a single counterparty with collateral support agreements  and monitors the market position of the program and its relative market position with each counterparty 
however  if one or more of these counterparties were in a liability position to the company and were unable to meet their obligations  any open derivative contracts with the counterparty could be subject to early termination  which could result in substantial losses for the company 
at december   the company had agreements with all of its 
table of contents counterparties containing early termination rights triggered by credit rating thresholds and or bilateral collateral provisions whereby security is required if market risk exposure exceeds a specified threshold amount based on the counterparty s credit rating 
the company also had agreements with counterparties in which cash deposits  lines of credit  and or pledged aircraft are required to be posted whenever the net fair value of derivatives associated with those counterparties exceeds specific thresholds cash is either posted by the counterparty if the value of derivatives is an asset to the company  or cash  lines or credit  and or aircraft could be posted by the company if the value of derivatives is a liability to the company 
refer to the counterparty credit risk and collateral table provided in note to the consolidated financial statements for the fair values of fuel derivatives  amounts posted as collateral  and applicable collateral posting threshold amounts as of december   at which such postings are triggered 
at december   no cash deposits  letters of credit  and or aircraft collateral were provided by or held by the company based on its outstanding fuel derivative instrument portfolio 
due to the terms of the company s current fuel hedging agreements with counterparties and the types of derivatives held  in the company s judgment  it does not have significant additional exposure to future cash collateral requirements 
as an example  if market prices for the commodities used in the company s fuel hedging activities were to decrease by percent from market prices as of december   given the company s fuel derivative portfolio  its aircraft collateral facilities  and its investment grade credit rating  it would likely provide an additional million in cash  letters of credit  and or aircraft collateral to its current counterparties 
however  the company would expect to also benefit from lower market prices paid for fuel used in its operations 
the company is also subject to the risk that the fuel derivatives it uses to hedge against fuel price volatility do not provide adequate protection 
a portion of the fuel derivatives in the company s hedge portfolio are based on the market price of west texas intermediate crude oil wti 
in some periods  the spread between wti and jet fuel has widened beyond historic norms  which has led to more ineffectiveness when measuring the company s hedges 
during those time periods  jet fuel prices have more closely correlated with changes in the price of brent crude oil brent 
the company has attempted to mitigate some of this risk by entering into more fuel hedges based on brent crude 
although the company has some fuel derivatives based on the price of brent  to the extent the spread between jet fuel and wti continues to fluctuate  a portion of the change in fair value of the company s hedges could continue to experience ineffectiveness and not provide complete protection against jet fuel price volatility 
the company also has agreements with each of its counterparties associated with its outstanding interest rate swap agreements in which cash collateral may be required based on the fair value of outstanding derivative instruments  as well as the company s and its counterparty s credit ratings 
as of december   million had been provided to one counterparty associated with interest rate derivatives based on the company s outstanding net liability derivative position with that counterparty 
in addition  in connection with interest rate swaps entered into by airtran  a total of million in cash collateral had been provided to one counterparty at december   as a result of a net liability derivative position with that counterparty 
the outstanding interest rate net derivative positions with all other counterparties at december   were assets to the company 
due to the significance of the company s fuel hedging program and the emphasis that the company places on utilizing fuel derivatives to reduce its fuel price risk  the company has created a system of governance and management oversight and has put in place a number of internal controls designed so that procedures are properly followed and accountability is present at the appropriate levels 
for example  the company has put in place controls designed to i create and maintain a comprehensive risk management policy  ii provide for proper authorization by the appropriate levels of management  iii provide for proper segregation of duties  iv maintain an appropriate level of knowledge regarding the execution of and the accounting for derivative instruments  and v have key performance indicators in place in order to adequately measure the performance of its hedging activities 
the company believes the governance structure that it has in place is adequate given the size and sophistication of its hedging program 

table of contents financial market risk the vast majority of the company s tangible assets are aircraft  which are long lived 
the company s strategy is to maintain a conservative balance sheet and grow capacity steadily and profitably under the right conditions 
while the company uses financial leverage  it strives to maintain a strong balance sheet and has a bbb rating with fitch  a bbb rating with standard poor s  and a baa credit rating with moody s as of december   all of which are considered investment grade 
the company s french credit agreements due do not give rise to significant fair value risk but do give rise to interest rate risk because this borrowing was originally issued as floating rate debt 
in addition  as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has converted certain of its long term debt to floating rate debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
although there is interest rate risk associated with these floating rate borrowings  the risk of the french credit agreements due is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the company may prepay this debt under certain conditions 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the material terms of the company s short term and long term debt 
as of december   excluding the notes or debentures that have been converted to a floating rate  the company s fixed rate senior unsecured notes outstanding included its million senior unsecured notes due  its million senior unsecured notes due  and its million senior unsecured notes due each of these notes had previously been converted to floating rates  but in and  the company terminated the fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements related to them 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
the effect of these terminations was that the interest associated with these debts prospectively reverted back to their original fixed rates 
as a result of the gains realized on these transactions  which will be amortized over the remaining term of the corresponding notes  and based on projected interest rates at the date of termination  the company does not believe its future interest expense  based on projected future interest rates at the date of termination  associated with these notes will significantly differ from the expense it would have recorded had the notes remained at floating rates 
the company believes the fixed interest rates associated with each of these notes are comparable to average rates prevailing for similar debt instruments over the last ten years 
the following table displays the characteristics of the company s secured fixed rate debt as of december  principal amount in millions effective fixed rate final maturity underlying collateral term loan agreement specified boeing aircraft term loan agreement specified boeing aircraft term loan agreement specified boeing aircraft the carrying value of the company s floating rate debt totaled million  and this debt had a weighted average maturity of years at floating rates averaging percent for the year ended december  in total  the company s fixed rate debt and floating rate debt represented percent and percent  respectively  of consolidated noncurrent assets at december  the company also has some risk associated with changing interest rates due to the short term nature of its invested cash  which totaled billion  and short term investments  which totaled billion  at december  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
the company currently invests available cash in certificates of deposit  highly rated money market instruments  investment grade commercial paper  treasury securities  us government agency securities  and other highly rated financial instruments  depending on market conditions and operating cash requirements 
as a result of turmoil in credit markets  the company has discontinued further investments in auction rate securities 
because of the short term nature of these investments  the returns earned parallel closely with short term floating interest rates 
the company has not undertaken any additional actions to cover interest rate market risk and is not a party to any other material market interest rate risk management activities 

table of contents a hypothetical percent change in market interest rates as of december   would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt instruments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the fair value of financial instruments 
a change in market interest rates could  however  have a corresponding effect on earnings and cash flows associated with the company s floating rate debt  invested cash excluding cash collateral deposits held  if applicable  floating rate aircraft leases  and short term investments because of the floating rate nature of these items 
assuming floating market rates in effect as of december  were held constant throughout a month period  a hypothetical percent change in those rates would have an immaterial impact on the company s net earnings and cash flows 
utilizing these assumptions and considering the company s cash balance excluding the impact of cash collateral deposits held or provided to counterparties  if applicable  short term investments  and floating rate debt outstanding at december   an increase in rates would have a net negative effect on the company s earnings and cash flows  while a decrease in rates would have a net positive effect on the company s earnings and cash flows 
however  a percent change in market rates would not impact the company s earnings or cash flow associated with the company s publicly traded fixed rate debt 
the company is also subject to a financial covenant included in its revolving credit facility  and is subject to credit rating triggers related to its credit card transaction processing agreements  the pricing related to any funds drawn under its revolving credit facility  and some of its hedging counterparty agreements 
certain covenants include the maintenance of minimum credit ratings and or triggers that are based on changes in these ratings 
the company s revolving credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring a minimum coverage ratio of adjusted pre tax income to fixed obligations  as defined 
as of december   the company was in compliance with this covenant and there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
however  if conditions change and the company fails to meet the minimum standards set forth in the revolving credit facility  there could be a reduction in the availability of cash under the facility  or an increase in the costs to keep the facility intact as written 
seven of the company s hedging counterparty agreements contain ratings triggers in which cash collateral would be required to be posted with the counterparty if the company s credit rating were to fall below investment grade by two of the three major rating agencies  and if the company were in a net liability position with the counterparty 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
as of december   no cash collateral deposits were provided by or held by the company under these provisions 
if the company s credit rating had been below investment grade as of that date  the company would have been required to post approximately million in additional cash collateral deposits with fuel hedge counterparties 
the company currently has agreements with organizations that process credit card transactions arising from purchases of air travel tickets by its customers utilizing american express  discover and mastercard visa 
credit card processors have financial risk associated with tickets purchased for travel because  although the processor generally forwards the cash related to the purchase to the company soon after the purchase is completed  the air travel generally occurs after that time  and the processor will have liability if the company does not ultimately provide the air travel 
under these processing agreements  and based on specified conditions  increasing amounts of cash reserves could be required to be posted with the counterparty 
a majority of the company s sales transactions are processed by chase paymentech 
should chargebacks processed by chase paymentech reach a certain level  proceeds from advance ticket sales could be held back and used to establish a reserve account to cover such chargebacks and any other disputed charges that might occur 
additionally  cash reserves are required to be established if the company s credit rating falls to specified levels below investment grade 
cash reserve requirements are based on the company s public debt rating and a corresponding percentage of the company s air traffic liability 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all credit card processing agreements 
however  the inability to enter into credit card processing agreements would have a material adverse effect on the business of the company 
the company believes that it will be able to continue to renew its existing credit card processing agreements or will be able to enter into new credit card processing agreements with other processors in the future
