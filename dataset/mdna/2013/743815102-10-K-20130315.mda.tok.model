item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report for more information 
in february  the board approved a stock repurchase program whereby we may repurchase shares of our common stock from the open market from time to time 
during  we spent approximately million to purchase  shares of our common stock in the open market under this program 
the shares of our common stock repurchased were placed into treasury 
no shares of our common stock were repurchased under this program during   and in  due to the significant and sustained decline in our market capitalization and the uncertainty in the state payer environment including related budgetary decisions  we initiated intangible asset impairment valuations and  based on the results  we recorded impairment charges totaling approximately million related to our goodwill and other intangible assets for the year ended december  in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  we prepaid million and million  respectively  of our term loan debt under the credit and guaranty agreement  as amended 
our current and long term debt obligations decreased to approximately million at december  from million at december  and from million at december  non emergency transportation services revenues for   and was positively impacted by the effect of membership increases related to new and existing contracts  geographical and program expansions in certain markets and rate adjustments  both positive and negative throughout a number of contracts due to increased utilization  program enhancements and competitive procurements awarded 
in addition  utilization of our education and other school based programs increased significantly in until present when compared to the utilization levels in further  we experienced higher utilization in as compared to due to the impact of an unusually mild winter in certain of our markets and the sustained high level of gas prices across the country 
we also incurred additional operating and implementation costs for as compared to related to market expansions and new contracts including staffing  training  travel and outreach communication material costs 
for a more detailed discussion of the effects of the events noted above on our revenue and operating margin for as compared to and as compared to  see the year to year analysis included in item management s discussion of financial condition and results of operations of this report 
our effective tax rate was higher than the united states federal statutory rate of for   and due primarily to state income taxes  net of federal benefit and other non deductible expenses 
in  the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the final determination of the tax benefits related to certain liabilities assumed as a result of a june acquisition and unfavorably impacted by lower income before income taxes  which was partially due to the million asset impairment charge recorded in in  these items were partially offset by the impact of the gain on bargain purchase of approximately million related to a june acquisition  recorded net of deferred taxes  which is not subject to income taxation 
additionally  in  these items were partially offset by total tax benefits of million recognized during the three months ended september  related to the true up of our tax provision from the filing of our united states federal and state tax returns 
the million true up was primarily attributable to reconciling our estimated liabilities using a blended state tax rate to actual state tax return amounts 
for  approximately million of the total goodwill impairment charge of approximately million was not deductible for income tax purposes as the goodwill was related to our acquisition of the equity interest in several businesses 
as a result  our effective income tax rate for decreased 
the decrease in the number of direct clients served from to was primarily due to the termination of certain programs and a change in eligibility requirements related to our work force development services 
the increase in the number of individuals eligible to receive non emergency transportation services from to is due to the population growth of medicaid eligible beneficiaries as well as the impact of new contracts 
on march   we executed a new credit facility and paid all amounts due under the existing credit facility with cash in the amount of million and proceeds from the new credit facility 
the new credit agreement provides us with a senior secured credit facility in aggregate principal amount of million  comprised of a million term loan facility and a million revolving credit facility 
in conjunction with the termination of the previous credit facility  we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt in of approximately million 
social services revenues for as compared to were unfavorably impacted by contract amount reductions and terminations and reforms such as managed care  which led to decreased authorizations for services we provide in certain of our markets 
in addition  revenue from our canadian operations declined from to due to the impact of a reorganization of the service delivery system in british columbia and increased competition in this market 
for further discussion of the effects of the events noted above on our social service revenues for as compared to  see the year to year analysis included in item management s discussion of financial condition and results of operations of this report 
due to the changes in british columbia described above  we initiated intangible asset impairment valuations of our canadian business and  based on the results  we recorded impairment charges totaling approximately million related to our intangible assets other than goodwill for the year ended december  we incurred expense net of benefit of forfeiture of stock based compensation of approximately million in for payments related to the retirement of two of our executive officers in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item  entitled  selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item of this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
certain risks  uncertainties and other factors  including but not limited to those set forth in item a  entitled  risk factors and elsewhere in this report may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
overview of our business we provide government sponsored social services directly and through not for profit organizations whose operations we manage under contract  and we arrange for and manage non emergency transportation services 
as a result of and in response to the large and growing population of eligible beneficiaries of government sponsored social services and non emergency transportation services  increasing pressure on governments to control costs and increasing acceptance of privatized social services  we have grown both organically and by making strategic acquisitions 
in november  our chief executive officer and chief financial officer retired and we retained our lead director to serve as interim chief executive officer and hired a new chief financial officer 
our executives will continue to focus on improving operating efficiencies  organic and acquisitive growth  and developing performance management systems designed to enhance and leverage our core competencies 
our core competencies include enduring customer relationships  geographic reach  breadth of services and experience  management of populations consisting of covered lives and provider networks  contract bidding infrastructure  managed care contracting experience and technology platform development 
by enhancing and leveraging these core competencies  we believe we can benefit from emerging trends in healthcare such as healthcare reform  integrated healthcare by providing services to individuals who are eligible for both medicaid and medicare benefits and by managing more populations eligible to receive our services to reduce the cost of care and outsourcing of transportation management 
while we believe we are well positioned to benefit from healthcare reform legislation and to offer our services to a growing population of individuals eligible to receive our services  there can be no assurances that programs under which we provide our services will receive continued or increased funding 
additionally  there can be no assurance of when the legislation will be implemented or when  and if  we will see any positive impact 
while we believe we are positioned to potentially benefit from recent trends that favor our in home provision of social services  budgetary pressures still exist that could reduce funding for the services we provide 
medicaid budgets are fluid and dramatic changes in the financing or structure of medicaid could have a negative impact on our business 
we believe our business model allows us to make adjustments to help mitigate state budget pressures that are impacted by federal spending 
during  wcg international ltd 
our canadian wholly owned subsidiary  or wcg  experienced a decline in its business due to the impact of a reorganization of the service delivery system in british columbia 
these matters are described in further detail below 
under the reorganized service delivery system  wcg faces increased competition for services that we believe could adversely affect our ability to gain new business in this market 
these factors resulted in a million reduction of the net book value of the customer relationships intangible asset 
while the reorganization of the service delivery system in british columbia presents challenges to our operations there  we believe our business model allows us to make adjustments in all of our markets to help mitigate system reforms that could challenge our overall profit margins 
with respect to our non emergency transportation management services segment  or net services  consisted of ongoing implementations and start up investments in multiple locations 
these implementations included expansions in connecticut  additional regions in south carolina and georgia  new implementations in texas and wisconsin as well as new york city  which is a multi phased implementation by borough and population group 
as of december   we were providing social services directly to over  unique clients  and had approximately million individuals eligible to receive services under our non emergency transportation services contracts 
we provided services to these clients from nearly locations in states  the district of columbia  united states  and british columbia and alberta  canada 
our working capital requirements are primarily funded by cash from operations and borrowings from our credit facility  which provides funding for general corporate purposes and acquisitions 
under our credit agreement  if we do not reduce the principal amount of our outstanding convertible senior subordinated notes due  or the notes  to million or less from million at december  by september  and certain other conditions are not met  the maturity date of our current credit facility may accelerate and our obligations under these facilities may become due and payable in  which could have a material adverse affect on our liquidity and capital resources 
we will consider a variety of alternatives to address this issue over the next few months  which may include sales of assets or equity  refinancing the debt outstanding under our credit facility or obtaining new financing and or negotiations with our lenders to restructure the applicable indebtedness 
we remain focused on deleveraging our balance sheet and continue to identify opportunities to further expand our service offerings 
how we grow our business and evaluate our performance our business has grown internally through organic expansion into new markets  increases in the number of clients served under contracts we or the entities we manage are awarded  and through strategic acquisitions 
we typically pursue organic expansion into markets that are contiguous to our existing markets or where we believe we can quickly establish a significant presence 
when we expand organically into a market  we typically have no clients or perform no management services in the market and are required to incur start up costs including the costs of space  required permits and initial personnel 
these costs are expensed as incurred and our new offices can be expected to incur losses for a period of time until we adequately grow our revenue from clients or management fees 
we continue to selectively identify and pursue strategic acquisitions in markets where we see opportunities but where we lack the contacts and or personnel to make a successful organic entry 
unlike organic expansion which involves start up costs that may dilute earnings  expansion through acquisitions have generally been accretive to our earnings 
however  we bear financing risk and where debt is used  the risk of leverage by expanding through acquisitions 
we also must integrate the acquired business into our operations which could disrupt our business and we may not be able to realize operating and economic synergies upon integration 
finally  our acquisitions may involve purchase prices in excess of the fair value of tangible assets and cash or receivables 
this excess purchase price is allocated to intangible assets  including goodwill  and is subject to periodic evaluation and impairment or other write downs that are charges against our earnings 
there are no assurances  however  that we will complete acquisitions in the future or that any completed acquisitions will prove profitable for us 
in all our markets we focus on several key performance indicators in managing our business 
specifically  we focus on growth in the number of clients served  as that particular metric is the key driver of our revenue growth 
we also focus on the number of employees and the amount of outsourced transportation cost as these items are our most important variable costs and the key to the management of our operating margins 
going forward we will focus on our core business to make it more efficient and effective by leveraging our technology platforms and expanding our shared services capability 
how we earn our revenue we operate in two segments social services and non emergency transportation services  or net services 
social services our revenue is derived from our provider contracts with state and local government agencies and government intermediaries  hmos  commercial insurers  and from our management contracts with not for profit social services organizations 
the government entities that pay for our services include welfare  child welfare and justice departments  public schools and state medicaid programs 
under a majority of the contracts where we provide social services directly  we are paid an hourly fee 
in other such situations  we receive a set monthly amount or we are paid amounts equal to the costs we incur to provide agreed upon services 
these revenues are presented in our consolidated statements of income as either revenue from home and community based services or foster care services 
where we contract to manage the operations of not for profit social services organizations  we receive a management fee that is either based upon a percentage of the revenue of the managed entity or a predetermined fee 
these revenues are presented in our consolidated statements of income as management fees 
because we provide substantially all administrative functions for these entities and our management fees are largely dependent upon their revenues  we also monitor for management and disclosure purposes the revenues of the entities we manage under contract 
net services where we provide non emergency transportation management services  we contract with state medicaid and local agencies  regional and medical hospital systems or private managed care companies 
most of our contracts for non emergency transportation management services are capitated where we are paid on a per member per month basis for each eligible member 
we do not direct bill for services under our capitated contracts as our revenue is based on covered lives 
our school transportation contracts are with local governments and are paid on a per trip basis or per bus per day basis 
these revenues are presented in our consolidated statements of income as non emergency transportation services revenue 
critical accounting policies and estimates general in preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are those policies most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
these policies require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting policies pertain to revenue recognition  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts  accounting for business combinations  goodwill and other intangible assets  accrued transportation costs  accounting for management agreement relationships  loss reserves for certain reinsurance and self funded insurance programs  stock based compensation and income taxes 
we have reviewed our critical accounting estimates with our board of directors  audit committee and disclosure committee 
revenue recognition at times we may receive funding for certain services in advance of services actually being rendered 
these amounts are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue until the actual services are rendered 
social services segment fee for service contracts 
revenue related to services provided under fee for service contracts is recognized at the time services are rendered and collection is determined to be probable 
such services are provided at established billing rates 
fee for service contracts represented approximately and of our social services segment revenue for and  respectively 
as services are rendered  documentation is prepared describing each service  time spent  and billing code under each contract to determine and support the value of each service provided 
this documentation is used as a basis for billing under our contracts 
the billing process and documentation submitted under our contracts vary among our payers 
the timing  amount and collection of our revenues under these contracts are dependent upon our ability to comply with the billing requirements specified by each payer 
failure to comply with these requirements could delay the collection of amounts due to us under a contract or result in adjustments to amounts billed 
the performance of our contracts is subject to the condition that sufficient funds are appropriated  authorized and allocated by each state  city or other local government 
if sufficient appropriations  authorizations and allocations are not provided by the respective state  city or other local government  we are at risk of immediate termination or renegotiation of the financial terms of our contracts 
cost based service contracts 
revenue from our cost based service contracts is recorded based on a combination of direct costs  indirect overhead allocations  and stated contractual margins on those costs 
these revenues are compared to annual contract budget limits and  depending on reporting requirements  allowances may be recorded for certain contingencies such as projected costs not incurred or excess cost per service over the allowable contract rate 
this policy results in recognizing revenue from these contracts based on allowable costs incurred 
the annual contract amount is based on projected costs to provide services under the contracts with adjustments for changes in the total contract amount 
we annually submit projected costs for the coming year which assist the contracting payers in establishing the annual contract amount to be paid for services provided under the contracts 
after the payers year end  we submit cost reports which are used by the contracting payers to determine the amount  if any  by which funds paid to us for services provided under the contracts were greater than the allowable costs 
completion of this review process may take several years from the date we submit a cost report 
in cases where funds paid to us exceed the allowable costs to provide services under contract  we may be required to repay amounts previously received 
our cost reports are routinely audited by our payers on an annual basis 
we periodically review our provisional billing rates and allocation of costs and provide for estimated adjustments from the contracting payers 
we believe that adequate provisions have been made in our consolidated financial statements for any adjustments that might result from the outcome of any cost report audits 
differences between the amounts provided and the settlement amounts  which historically have not been material  are recorded in our consolidated statement of income in the year of settlement 
cost based service contracts represented approximately and of our social services operating segment revenue for and  respectively 
annual block purchase contract 
our annual block purchase contract with the community partnership of southern arizona requires us to provide or arrange for behavioral health services to eligible populations of beneficiaries as defined in the contract 
we must provide a complete range of behavioral health clinical  case management  therapeutic and administrative services 
we are obliged to provide services only to those clients with a demonstrated medical necessity 
our annual funding allocation amount is subject to increase when our patient service encounters exceed the contract amount  however  such increases in the annual funding allocation amount are subject to government appropriation and may not be approved 
there is no contractual limit to the number of eligible beneficiaries that may be assigned to us  or a specified limit to the level of services that may be provided to these beneficiaries if the services are deemed to be medically necessary 
therefore  we are at risk if the costs of providing necessary services exceed the associated reimbursement 
the terms of the contract may be reviewed prospectively and amended as necessary to ensure adequate funding of our contractual obligations  however  we cannot guarantee amendments will be approved or that funding will be adequate 
our revenues under the annual block purchase contract for and represented approximately and  respectively  of our social services operating segment revenues for each year 
management agreements 
we maintain management agreements with a number of not for profit social services organizations whereby we provide certain management services for these organizations 
in exchange for our services  we receive a management fee that is either based on a percentage of the revenues of these organizations or a predetermined fee 
management fees earned under our management agreements represented approximately of our social services operating segment revenue in each of and the costs associated with rendering these management services are shown as client service expense and in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income 
net services segment capitation contracts 
approximately of our non emergency transportation services revenue is generated under capitated contracts where we assume the responsibility of meeting the transportation needs of a specific geographic population 
revenues under capitation contracts with our payers are based on per member monthly fees for the number of participants in the payer s program 
aggregate revenue from our top five payers for and represented approximately and of our net services operating segment revenue for such period  respectively 
fee for service contracts 
revenues earned under fee for service contracts are recognized when the service is provided 
revenue under these types of contracts is based upon contractually established billing rates less allowance for contractual adjustments 
estimates of contractual adjustments are based upon payment terms specified in the related agreements 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts clients are referred to us through governmental social services programs and we only provide services at the direction of a payer under a contractual arrangement 
these circumstances have historically minimized any uncollectible amounts for services rendered 
however  we recognize that not all amounts recorded as accounts receivable will ultimately be collected 
we record all accounts receivable amounts at their contracted amount  less an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to cover the risk that an account will not be collected 
we regularly evaluate our accounts receivable  especially receivables that are past due  and reassess our allowance for doubtful accounts based on specific client collection issues 
we pay particular attention to amounts outstanding for days and longer 
any account receivable older than days is deemed uncollectible and written off or fully reserved unless we have specific information from the payer that payment for those amounts is forthcoming or other evidence which we believe supports the collection of amounts older than days 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific payer s inability to meet its financial obligation  we record a specific addition to our allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably expect to collect 
our write off experience for and was less than of revenue 
accounting for business combinations  goodwill and other intangible assets when we consummate an acquisition we separately value all acquired identifiable intangible assets apart from goodwill in accordance with accounting standards codification  or asc  topic business combinations 
we analyze the carrying value of goodwill at the end of each fiscal year 
when analyzing goodwill for impairment we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test described below 
if we determine  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then we would calculate the fair value of the reporting unit and perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
in connection with our year end asset impairment test  we reconcile the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization including a reasonable control premium 
as part of this annual impairment test  we also compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  there is an indication of impairment 
if an indication of impairment is identified  the impairment loss  if any  is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying value 
in calculating the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other identifiable assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
similarly conducted interim impairment tests may also be required in advance of our annual impairment test if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value  including goodwill  of one or more of our reporting units below the reporting unit s carrying value 
such circumstances could include but are not limited to loss of significant contracts  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the climate of our business  unanticipated competition  or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
in determining whether or not we had goodwill impairment to report for the years ended december   and  we considered both a market based valuation approach and an income based valuation approach when estimating the fair values of our reporting units with goodwill balances as of such dates 
in arriving at the fair value of the reporting units  greater weight was attributed to the market approach than the income approach as we place less confidence on the forecasted results after we weighted the market based valuation results at and the income based valuation results at for the majority of our reporting units  which was consistent with our weighting methodology in and under the market approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is determined using one or more methods based on current values in the market for similar businesses 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the cash flow streams expected to be generated by the reporting unit over an appropriate period and then discounting the cash flows to present value using an appropriate discount rate 
the income approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions  including estimates of future revenue and expenses  growth rates and discount rates 
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates relating to future cash flows  including our interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations  and assumptions about our strategic plans with regard to our operations 
to the extent additional information arises  market conditions change or our strategies change  it is possible that our conclusion regarding whether existing goodwill is impaired could change and result in a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
given the reorganization of the service delivery system in british columbia  canada during  we evaluated whether events  referred to as triggering events  had occurred during the three and nine months ended september  that would require us to perform an interim period goodwill impairment test in accordance with asc topic intangibles goodwill and other  or asc as of september  during the nine months ended september   the impact of changes in the above mentioned service delivery system resulted in  among other things  the expiration of all contracts for services under this system 
the service delivery system reorganization commenced in the latter part of the first quarter of in accordance with the time line the payer set forth when the payer put up for bid new contracts that combined federal and provincial funding streams and services which were previously contracted separately 
due primarily to an increased level of competition including over bidders for awards and a decrease in the number of services funded in this market  wcg was unable to regain the level of business it enjoyed prior to the reorganization of the service delivery system 
the impact of this system reorganization was not fully realized until the conclusion of the transition to the new system in the third quarter of and contributed to a decrease in the financial results of operations of wcg for three and nine months ended september  we determined that these factors were indicators that an interim goodwill impairment test was required under asc based on the results of our interim asset impairment test as of september  and our annual asset impairment test completed as of december   and  we determined that none of our goodwill was impaired as of such dates 
the assumptions used to estimate fair value were based on estimates of future revenue and expenses incorporated in our current operating plans  growth rates and discounts rates  our interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations 
significant assumptions and estimates included in our current operating plans were associated with revenue growth  profitability  and related cash flows 
the discount rate used to estimate fair value was risk adjusted in consideration of the economic conditions of the reporting units 
we also considered assumptions that market participants may use 
by their nature  these projections and assumptions are uncertain 
potential events and circumstances that could have an adverse effect on our assumptions include the lack of sufficient funds allocated by our state and local government payers to compensate us for the level of services we currently provide or the potential increased level of service we may be required to provide in the future due to the impact of the current economic downturn  and loss of a significant contract 
as of december   the amount of goodwill allocated to wcg was approximately million 
based on the results of our annual asset impairment test completed as of december   we determined that  although our goodwill related to wcg was not impaired  the percentage by which the fair value of wcg exceeded the carrying value of its total assets was approximately 
in light of the nominal excess of fair value over current carrying values  management cannot guarantee that impairments of wcg s goodwill will not occur in future periods 
the fair values of our other reporting units exceeded their carrying values by a range of to 
in connection with our acquisitions  we allocate a portion of the purchase consideration to management contracts  customer relationships  restrictive covenants  software licenses and developed technology based on the direct or indirect contribution to future cash flows on a discounted cash flow basis expected from these intangible assets over their respective useful lives 
we assess whether any relevant factors limit the period over which acquired assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows for amortization purposes and determine an appropriate useful life for acquired customer relationships based on the expected period of time we will provide services to the payer 
while we use discounted cash flows to value intangible assets  we have elected to use the straight line method of amortization to determine amortization expense 
if applicable  we assess the recoverability of the unamortized balance of our long lived assets based on undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the review indicates that the carrying value is not fully recoverable  the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of any long lived asset is recognized as an impairment loss 
in connection with our interim asset impairment analysis conducted as of september   we determined that  for the same reasons noted above related to our goodwill impairment analysis  the value of the customer relationships acquired in connection with our acquisition of wcg was impaired as of september  consequently  we recorded a non cash charge of approximately million in our social services operating segment to reduce the carrying value of customer relationships acquired in connection with our acquisition of wcg based on their revised estimated fair values 
in estimating the fair values of these intangible assets  we based our estimates on a projected discounted cash flow analysis 
based on our annual asset impairment analysis as of december   we determined that there was no additional impairment to these assets 
the total asset impairment charge related to other intangible assets for of million was included in asset impairment charge in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
accrued transportation costs transportation costs are estimated and accrued in the month the services are rendered by outsourced providers utilizing gross reservations for transportation services less cancellations  and average costs per transportation service by customer contract 
average costs per contract are derived by utilizing historical cost trends 
actual costs relating to a specific accounting period are monitored and compared to estimated accruals 
adjustments to those accruals are made based on reconciliations with actual costs incurred 
accounting for management agreement relationships due to the nature of our business and the requirement or desire by certain payers to contract with not for profit social services organizations  we sometimes enter into management contracts with not for profit social services organizations where we provide them with administrative  program and other management services 
these not for profit organizations contract directly with state and local agencies to provide a variety of community based mental health and foster care services to children and adults 
each of these organizations is separately incorporated and  with respect to the internal revenue code section c entities  organized with its own independent board of directors 
our management agreements with these not for profit organizations typically require us to provide management  accounting  advisory  supportive  consultative and administrative services  require us to provide the necessary resources to effectively manage the business and services provided  require that we hire  supervise and terminate personnel  review existing personnel policies and assist in adopting and implementing progressive personnel policies  and compensate us with a management fee in exchange for the services provided 
all of our management services are subject to the approval or direction of the managed entities board of directors 
we have concluded that our management agreements do not meet the provisions of asc topic  consolidation  or asc  thus the operations of these organizations are not consolidated with our operations 
we will evaluate the impact of the provisions of asc  if any  on future acquired management agreements 
loss reserves for certain reinsurance and self funded insurance programs we reinsure a substantial portion of our general and professional liability and workers compensation costs under reinsurance programs through our wholly owned subsidiary social services providers captive insurance company  or spcic 
spcic is a licensed captive insurance company domiciled in the state of arizona 
spcic maintains reserves for obligations related to our reinsurance programs for our general and professional liability and workers compensation coverage 
as of december  and  spcic had reserves of approximately million and million  respectively  for the general and professional liability and workers compensation programs 
in addition  we own provado insurance services  inc  or provado  a licensed captive insurance company domiciled in the state of south carolina 
provado historically provided reinsurance for policies written by a third party insurer for general liability  automobile liability  and automobile physical damage coverage to various members of the network of subcontracted transportation providers and independent third parties within our net services operating segment 
effective february   provado has not renewed its reinsurance agreement and will not assume additional liabilities for policies commencing thereafter 
it continues to administer existing policies for the foreseeable future and resolves remaining and future claims related to these policies 
provado maintains reserves for obligations related to the reinsurance programs for general liability  automobile liability  and automobile physical damage coverage 
as of december  and  provado recorded reserves of approximately million and million  respectively 
we utilize analyses prepared by third party administrators and independent actuaries based on historical claims information with respect to the general and professional liability coverage  workers compensation coverage  automobile liability  and automobile physical damage to determine the amount of required reserves 
we also maintain a self funded health insurance program provided to our employees 
with respect to this program  we consider historical and projected medical utilization data when estimating our health insurance program liability and related expense as well as using services of a third party administrator 
as of december  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  in reserve for our self funded health insurance programs 
we regularly analyze our reserves for incurred but not reported claims  and for reported but not paid claims related to our reinsurance and self funded insurance programs 
we believe our reserves are adequate 
however  significant judgment is involved in assessing these reserves such as assessing historical paid claims  average lags between the claims incurred date  reported dates and paid dates  and the frequency and severity of claims 
there may be differences between actual settlement amounts and recorded reserves and any resulting adjustments are included in expense once a probable amount is known 
there were no significant adjustments recorded in the periods covered by this report 
any significant increase in the number of claims or costs associated with claims made under these programs above our reserves could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
stock based compensation we follow the fair value recognition provisions of asc topic compensation stock compensation  or asc  which requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payments at fair value 
with respect to stock option awards  the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing formula and amortized over the option s vesting periods 
the black scholes merton option pricing formula requires us to make assumptions for the expected dividend yield  stock price volatility  life of options and risk free interest rate 
we adopted the requirements of asc using the modified prospective transition method in which compensation costs are recognized beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of asc for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of asc that remain unvested on the effective date 
we follow the short cut method prescribed by asc to calculate our pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of asc  or apic pool 
there was no effect on our financial results for or related to the application of the short cut method to determine our apic pool balance 
under asc  the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the estimated tax benefit of compensation costs recognized in the statement of income for those options are classified as financing cash flows 
for  and  we had a net tax shortfall resulting from the exercise and cancellation of stock options of approximately   and  net of approximately   and  in excess tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options  respectively 
the gross excess tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options are reflected as cash flows from financing activities for  and in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
our long term incentive plan  as amended  or plan  allows us the flexibility to issue up to  shares of our common stock pursuant to awards of stock options  stock appreciation rights  restricted stock  unrestricted stock  stock units including restricted stock units and performance awards to employees  directors  consultants  advisors and others who are in a position to make contributions to our success and to encourage such persons to take into account our long term interests and the interests of our stockholders through ownership of our common stock or securities with value tied to our common stock 
income taxes deferred income taxes are determined by the liability method in accordance with asc topic income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we record a valuation allowance which includes amounts for state net operating loss carryforwards for which we have concluded that it is more likely than not that these net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized in the ordinary course of operations 
we recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense 
results of operations segment reporting 
our financial operating results are organized and reviewed by our chief operating decision maker along our service lines in two reportable segments ie  social services and net services 
we operate these reportable segments as separate divisions and differentiate the segments based on the nature of the services they offer 
the following describes each of our segments 
social services social services includes government sponsored social services consisting of home and community based counseling  foster care and not for profit management services 
our operating entities within social services provide services to a common customer group  principally individuals and families 
all of our operating entities within social services follow similar operating procedures and methods in managing their operations and each operating entity works within a similar regulatory environment  primarily under medicaid regulations 
we manage our operating activities within social services by actual to budget comparisons within each operating entity rather than by comparison between entities 
our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews financial and non financial information for each individual entity within social services 
while financial performance in comparison to budget is evaluated on an entity by entity basis  our operating entities comprising social services are aggregated into one reporting segment for financial reporting purposes because we believe that the operating entities exhibit similar long term financial performance 
in addition  our revenues  costs and contribution margins are not significantly affected by allocating more or less resources to individual operating entities within social services because the economic characteristics of our business are substantially dependent upon individualized market demographics which affect the amount and type of services in demand as well as our cost structure primarily payroll and related costs and contract rates with payers 
in conjunction with the financial performance trends  we believe the similar qualitative characteristics of the operating entities we aggregate within social services and budgetary constraints of our payers in each market provide a foundation to conclude that the entities that we aggregate within social services have similar economic characteristics 
thus  we believe the economic characteristics of our operating entities within social services meet the criteria for aggregation into a single reporting segment under asc topic segment reporting 
net services net services involves managing the delivery of non emergency transportation services 
we operate net services as a separate division with operational management and service offerings distinct from our social services operating segment 
financial and operating performance reporting is conducted at a contract level and reviewed weekly at both the operating entity level as well as the corporate level by our chief operating decision maker 
gross margin performance of individual contracts is consolidated under the associated operating entity and direct general and administrative expenses are allocated to the operating entity 
consolidated results the following table sets forth the percentage of consolidated total revenues represented by items in our consolidated statements of income for the periods presented year ended december  revenues home and community based services foster care services management fees non emergency transportation services total revenues operating expenses client service expense cost of non emergency transportation services general and administrative expense asset impairement charge depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income non operating expense interest expense  net loss on extinguishment of debt gain on bargain purchase income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income overview of trends of our results of operations for our social services revenues for as compared to were unfavorably impacted by contract price reductions and terminations and trends in certain of our markets where tighter controls over authorizations and referrals are being implemented in response to continuing state budget challenges as well as waivers granted under the no child left behind act  or nclb 
in addition  revenue from our canadian operations declined from to due to the impact of a reorganization of the service delivery system in british columbia and increased competition in this market as described above 
increased competition in this market could unfavorably impact our ability to generate the level of revenue enjoyed by wcg prior to this reorganization 
partially offsetting decreases in these revenues for as compared to  was additional revenue contributed by the redco group  inc  or redco  which we acquired in june  continued increases in medicaid enrollment  our preferred provider status we enjoy in many of our markets  and relatively stable rates overall 
we believe the industry trend away from the more expensive out of home service providers in favor of home and community based delivery systems like ours will continue 
in addition  we believe that our effective low cost home and community based service delivery system is becoming more attractive to certain payers that have historically only contracted with not for profit social services organizations 
further  we believe we are well positioned to benefit from emerging trends in healthcare  particularly the development of integrated models of healthcare delivery and financing and increased outsourcing of transportation management 
our net services revenue for as compared to was favorably impacted by the expansion of business in the connecticut  georgia  and south carolina markets  as well as continued expansion of our california ambulance commercial and managed care lines of business 
revenue for also reflects new contracts in new york and texas  and an additional contract in wisconsin which commenced on september  partially offsetting these revenue gains  we incurred additional operating and implementation costs related to these market expansions and new contracts including staffing  training  travel and outreach communication material costs 
in addition  we experienced higher utilization in as compared to due to the impact of an unusually mild winter in certain of our markets partially offset by lower utilization due to the impact of hurricane sandy in the northeast and the sustained high level of gas prices across the country  which resulted in higher transportation costs to us both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue for while we believe that increased utilization will continue to be a factor which could impact the results of our operations for  we expect continued positive revenue impact from new contracts implemented in and from negotiated rate adjustments in select programs 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues year ended december  percent change home and community based services foster care services management fees non emergency transportation services total revenues home and community based services 
contract price reductions in arizona  contract terminations in michigan  texas  virginia and canada  the impact of waivers granted under nclb and reforms in managed care in certain regions led to a decrease in home and community based services revenue for as compared to the decrease in revenue was partially offset by the acquisition of redco in june  which contributed approximately million to home and community based services revenue for as compared to further offsetting the decrease in revenue from to was the impact of increased census in certain locations as well as new programs being implemented in various markets 
foster care services 
our foster care services revenue decreased from to primarily as a result of a new per diem rate structure implemented in indiana in january  which reduced payments for foster care services in that state as well as a decrease in foster care services provided in arizona  oregon and nevada due to reduced payer authorizations for these services 
this decrease  however  was partially offset by increased foster care services provided in tennessee as we continue to build our foster care program in that state 
management fees 
fees for management services provided to certain not for profit organizations under management services agreements decreased in as compared to primarily due to our acquisition of redco  with whom we previously had a management services agreement 
the acquisition of redco resulted in a reduction of management fees of approximately  in non emergency transportation services

a significant portion of this revenue was generated under capitated contracts where we assumed the responsibility of meeting the transportation needs of beneficiaries residing in a specific geographic region for fixed payment amounts per beneficiary 
due to the fixed revenue stream and variable expense structure of our net services operating segment  expenses related to this segment vary with seasonal fluctuations 
we expect our operating results will continuously fluctuate on a quarterly basis

asset impairment charge during  wcg experienced a decline in its business due to the impact of a reorganization of the service delivery system in british columbia 
as part of this reorganization  all of the contracts for services in this market expired and new contracts were put up for bid 
due to an increased level of competition in british columbia and a decrease in the number of services funded  wcg was unable to regain the level of business it enjoyed prior to the reorganization 
the impact of this system reorganization was not fully realized until the conclusion of the transition to the new system in the third quarter of and contributed to a decrease in the financial results of operations of wcg for based on these factors  we initiated an analysis of the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets and determined that customer relationships which comprise other intangible assets were impaired at september  based on this determination  we recorded a non cash charge of approximately million for the three and nine months ended september   based on a preliminary assessment  to reduce the carrying value of customer relationships based on their estimated fair values

seasonality our quarterly operating results and operating cash flows normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business 
in our social services operating segment  lower client demand for our home and community based services during the holiday and summer seasons generally results in lower revenue during those periods  however  our expenses related to the social services operating segment do not vary significantly with these changes 
as a result  our social services operating segment experiences lower operating margins during the holiday and summer seasons 
our net services operating segment also experiences fluctuations in demand for our non emergency transportation services during the summer  winter and holiday seasons 
due to higher demand in the summer months and lower demand in the winter and holiday seasons  coupled with a fixed revenue stream based on a per member per month based structure  our net services operating segment normally experiences lower operating margins in the summer season and higher operating margins in the winter and holiday seasons 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results and operating cash flows to continue as a result of the seasonal demand for our home and community based services and non emergency transportation services 
as we enter new markets  we could be subject to additional seasonal variations along with any competitive response by other social services and transportation providers

reinsurance liability reserves related to our reinsurance programs increased resulting in cash provided by operating activities of approximately million 
other long term liabilities increased since december  due primarily to the cash receipt of approximately million from british columbia related to an arbitral award  however  in the event british columbia prevails in its arguments during the appeal process  british columbia will seek immediate repayment of the amount of the arbitral award

contingent obligations 
under the providence service corporation deferred compensation plan  as amended  or deferred compensation plan  eligible employees and independent contractors or a participating employer as defined in the deferred compensation plan may defer all or a portion of their base salary  service bonus  performance based compensation earned in a period of months or more  commissions and  in the case of independent contractors  compensation reportable on form the deferred compensation plan is unfunded and benefits are paid from our general assets 
as of december   there were six participants in the deferred compensation plan 
we also maintain a a deferred compensation rabbi trust plan for highly compensated employees of our net services operating segment 
benefits are paid from our general assets under this plan 
as of december   highly compensated employees participated in this plan 
management agreements we maintain management agreements with a number of not for profit social services organizations that require us to provide management and administrative services for each organization 
in exchange for these services  we receive a management fee that is either based upon a percentage of the revenues of these organizations or a predetermined fee 
the not for profit social services organizations managed by us that qualify under section c of the internal revenue code  referred to as a c entity  each maintain a board of directors  a majority of which are independent 
all economic decisions by the board of any c entity that affect us are made solely by the independent board members 
we encourage each managed entity to obtain a third party fairness opinion regarding our management fee from an independent appraiser retained by the independent board members of the tax exempt organizations 
management fees generated under our management agreements represented and of our revenue for and  respectively 
in accordance with our management agreements with these not for profit organizations  we have obligations to manage their business and services 
management fee receivable at december  and totaled million and million  respectively  and management fee revenue was recognized on all of these receivables 
in order to enhance liquidity of the entities we manage  we may allow the managed entities to defer payment of their respective management fees 
in addition  since government contractors who provide social or similar services to government beneficiaries sometimes experience collection delays due to either lack of proper documentation of claims  government budgetary processes or similar reasons outside the contractors control either directly or as managers of other contracting entities  we generally do not consider a management fee receivable to be uncollectible due solely to its age until it is days old 
the following is a summary of the aging of our management fee receivable balances as of december  and march  june  september and december  at less than days days days days over days december  march  june  september  december  each month we evaluate the solvency  outlook and ability to pay outstanding management fees of the entities we manage 
if the likelihood that we will not be paid is other than remote  we defer the recognition of these management fees until we are certain that payment is probable 
we have deemed payment of all of the management fee receivables to be probable based on our collection history with these entities as the long term manager of their operations 
our days sales outstanding for our managed entities decreased from days at december  to days at december  reinsurance and self funded insurance programs reinsurance we reinsure a substantial portion of our general and professional liability and workers compensation costs under reinsurance programs through spcic 
historically  we also provided reinsurance for policies written by a third party insurer for general liability  automobile liability  and automobile physical damage coverage to certain members of the network of subcontracted transportation providers and independent third parties under our net services operating segment through provado 
while provado did not renew its insurance agreement in february and no longer assumes liabilities for new policies  it will continue to administer existing policies for the forseeable future and resolve remaining and future claims related to those policies 
provado is a licensed captive insurance company domiciled in the state of south carolina 
the decision to reinsure our risks and provide a self funded health insurance program to our employees was made based on current conditions in the insurance marketplace that have led to increasingly higher levels of self insurance retentions  increasing number of coverage limitations  and fluctuating insurance premium rates 
spcic spcic  which is a licensed captive insurance company domiciled in the state of arizona  reinsures third party insurers for general and professional liability exposures for the first dollar of each and every loss up to million per loss and million in the aggregate 
at december   the cumulative reserve for expected losses since inception in of this reinsurance program was approximately million 
the excess premium over our expected losses may be used to fund spcic s operating expenses  fund any deficit arising in workers compensation liability coverage  provide for surplus reserves  and to fund any other risk management activities 
spcic reinsures a third party insurer for worker s compensation insurance for the first dollar of each and every loss up to  per occurrence with an million annual policy aggregate limit 
the cumulative reserve for expected losses since inception in of this reinsurance program at december  was approximately million 
based on an independent actuarial report  our expected losses related to workers compensation and general and professional liability in excess of our liability under our associated reinsurance programs at december  was approximately million 
we recorded a corresponding receivable from third party insurers and liability at december  for these expected losses  which would be paid by third party insurers to the extent losses are incurred 
we have an umbrella liability insurance policy providing additional coverage in the amount of million in the aggregate in excess of the policy limits of the general and professional liability insurance policy and automobile liability insurance policy 
spcic had restricted cash of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  which was restricted to secure the reinsured claims losses of spcic under the general and professional liability and workers compensation reinsurance programs 
the full extent of claims may not be fully determined for years 
therefore  the estimates of potential obligations are based on recommendations of an independent actuary using historical data  industry data  and our claims experience 
although we believe that the amounts accrued for losses incurred but not reported under the terms of our reinsurance programs are sufficient  any significant increase in the number of claims or costs associated with these claims made under these programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
provado under a reinsurance agreement with a third party insurer  provado reinsures the third party insurer for the first  of each loss for each line of coverage  subject to an annual aggregate equal to of gross written premium  and certain claims in excess of  to an additional aggregate limit of million 
the cumulative reserve for expected losses of this reinsurance program at december  was approximately million 
as noted above  effective february   provado did not renew its reinsurance agreement and will not assume liabilities for policies after that date 
it will continue to administer existing policies for the foreseeable future and resolve remaining and future claims related to these policies 
the liabilities for expected losses and loss adjustment expenses are based primarily on individual case estimates for losses reported by claimants 
an estimate is provided for losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred but not reported on the basis of our claims experience and claims experience of the industry 
these estimates are reviewed at least annually by independent consulting actuaries 
as experience develops and new information becomes known  the estimates are adjusted 
providence liability insurance coverages during the second quarter of  we increased our reinsurance of a third party insurer for worker s compensation insurance for the first dollar of each and every loss up to  per occurrence  from  per occurrence  and increased the annual policy aggregate limit from million to million 
the table below summarizes our liability insurance programs as of december  coverage type coverage limit reinsurance automobile crime director officer liability employed lawyers employment practices liability network security and privacy general professional liability  per loss   aggregate fully reinsured by spcic umbrella  in excess of general and professional liability and auto liability workers compensation statutory amounts reinsured by spcic up to  per claim with a  aggregated limit while we are insured for these types of claims  damages exceeding our insurance limits or outside our insurance coverage  such as a claim for fraud or punitive damages  could adversely affect our cash flow and financial condition 
health insurance we offer our employees an option to participate in a self funded health insurance program 
as of december   health claims were self funded with a stop loss umbrella policy with a third party insurer to limit the maximum potential liability for individual claims to  per person and for a maximum potential claim liability based on member enrollment 
health insurance claims are paid as they are submitted to the plan administrator 
we maintain accruals for claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the plan administrator and therefore have not been paid 
the incurred but not reported reserve is based on an established cap and current payment trends of health insurance claims 
the liability for the self funded health plan of approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively  was recorded in reinsurance liability reserve in our consolidated balance sheets 
we charge our employees a portion of the costs of our self funded group health insurance programs 
we determine this charge at the beginning of each plan year based upon historical and projected medical utilization data 
any difference between our projections and our actual experience is borne by us 
we estimate potential obligations for liabilities under this program to reserve what we believe to be a sufficient amount to cover liabilities based on our past experience 
any significant increase in the number of claims or costs associated with claims made under this program above what we reserve could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
contractual cash obligations 
the following is a summary of our future contractual cash obligations as of december  at december  contractual cash obligations s total less than year years years after years debt interest purchased services commitments capital leases operating leases total future interest payments have been calculated at rates that existed as of december  under the terms of the credit agreement  if we do not reduce the amount of the notes to million or less from million at december  by september   the maturity date of our current credit facility may accelerate and our obligations in aggregate principal amount of million together with any outstanding revolver borrowings under this facility may become due and payable in  see liquidity and capital resources 
stock repurchase program in  we spent approximately million to repurchase  shares of our common stock in the open market under a stock repurchase program approved by our board of directors on february  under this stock repurchase program we may repurchase up to one million shares of our common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  depending on market conditions and our capital requirements 
since inception  we have spent approximately million to purchase  shares of our common stock on the open market 
we did not purchase shares of our common stock during the period through under this plan 
new accounting pronouncements in  the fasb issued two asus  which amend the guidance for the presentation of comprehensive income 
the amended guidance allows an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in both choices  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
in addition  the amended guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the amendments do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
we adopted the asus effective january  the adoption of the amended guidance impacted the presentation of other comprehensive income as we previously presented the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
in september  the fasb issued asu intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment  or asu asu is intended to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment 
asu permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described in asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
asu is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted  including for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed as of a date before september   if an entity s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued 
we adopted asu effective january  the adoption of asu has not impacted our consolidated financial statements 
pending accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued asu comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income asu 
asu is intended to improve the reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
accordingly  an entity is required to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in net income if the amount being reclassified is required under gaap to be reclassified in its entirety to net income 
for other amounts that are not required under gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting period  an entity is required to cross reference other disclosures required under gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts 
the amendments in this asu supersede the presentation requirements for reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income in asu and asu asu is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
we believe that asu will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
other accounting standards and exposure drafts  such as exposure drafts related to revenue recognition  leases and fair value measurements  that have been issued or proposed by the fasb or other standards setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are being evaluated to determine whether adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency translation we conduct business in canada through our wholly owned subsidiary wcg  and as such  our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we believe that the impact of currency fluctuations does not represent a significant risk to us given the size and scope of our current international operations 
therefore  we do not hedge against the possible impact of this risk 
a adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rate would not have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
interest rate and market risk as of december   we had borrowings under our term loan of approximately million and no borrowings under our revolving line of credit

the related contracts are subject to possible statutory and regulatory changes  rate adjustments  administrative rulings  rate freezes and funding reductions 
reductions in amounts paid under these contracts for our services or changes in methods or regulations governing payments for our services could materially adversely affect our revenue and profitability 
for the year ended december   we conducted a portion of our operations in canada through wcg 
at december   approximately million  or  of our net assets were located in canada 
we are subject to the risks inherent in conducting business across national boundaries  any one of which could adversely impact our business 
in addition to currency fluctuations  these risks include  among other things i economic downturns  ii changes in or interpretations of local law  governmental policy or regulation  iii restrictions on the transfer of funds into or out of the country  iv varying tax systems  v delays from doing business with governmental agencies  vi nationalization of foreign assets  and vii government protectionism 
we intend to continue to evaluate opportunities to establish additional operations in canada 
one or more of the foregoing factors could impair our current or future operations and  as a result  harm our overall business
