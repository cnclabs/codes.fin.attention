these sales during the last three years totaled approximately million in  million in and million in franchise and other fees earned totaled approximately million in  million in and million in these fees represent a reimbursement for use of the fred name and administrative costs incurred on behalf of the franchised stores 
the company does not intend to expand its franchise network

the company s merchants have the discretion to mark down slow moving items 
the company offers regular clearance of seasonal merchandise and conducts sales and promotions of particular items 
the company also encourages its store managers to create impactful in store advertising displays and signage in order to increase customer traffic and impulse purchases 
store operations fred stores are open seven days a week and store hours at most locations are from am to am pharmacy departments typically close at pm monday through saturday and are closed all day on sunday 
each fred store is managed by a full time store manager and those stores with a pharmacy employ a pharmacist in charge  who manages the pharmacy department within the store 
the company s district managers  five regional vice presidents and executive vice president of store operations supervise the management and operation of fred stores 
fred operates pharmacies as of february   which offer brand name and generic pharmaceuticals and are staffed by licensed pharmacists and are managed by healthcare managers 
the addition of acquired pharmacies in the company s stores has resulted in increased store sales and sales per selling square foot 
management believes that the pharmacy department  in addition to the other merchandise departments  increases customer traffic and repeat visits and is an integral part of the store s operation 
the company has an incentive compensation plan for store managers  pharmacists and district managers based on meeting or exceeding targeted profit percentage contributions 
a couple of factors included in determining profit percentage contribution are gross profits and controllable expenses at the store level 
these factors of operating performance are reviewed regularly by executive management 
management believes that this incentive compensation plan  together with the company s store management training program  are instrumental in maximizing store performance 
the company s training program covers all aspects of the company s operation from product knowledge to handling customers with courtesy 
inventory control the company s centralized management information system maintains a daily stock keeping unit sku level inventory and current and historical sales information for each store and the distribution centers 
this system is supported by our in store point of sale pos system  which captures sku and other data at the time of sale 
the merchandising arm of the system uses the data received from the stores to provide integrated inventory management  automated replenishment  promotional planning  space management  and merchandise planning 
additionally  the company uses nex dex technology for in store receiving and inventory control for all items delivered directly to our stores 
the company conducts annual physical inventory counts at all fred stores and has implemented the use of radio frequency devices rf guns to conduct cycle counts to ensure replenishment accuracy 
distribution the company has an  square foot distribution center in memphis  tennessee that services stores and a  square foot distribution center in dublin  georgia that services stores see properties below 
approximately of the merchandise received by fred stores in was shipped through these distribution centers  with the remainder primarily pharmaceuticals  certain snack food items  greeting cards  beverages and tobacco products being shipped directly to the stores by suppliers 
for distribution  the company uses owned and leased trailers and tractors  as well as common carriers 
the company s warehouse management system is completely automated and provides conveyor control and pick  pack and ship processes by using portable radio frequency terminals 
this system is integrated with the company s centralized management information system to provide up to date perpetual records as well as facilitating merchandise allocation and distribution decisions 
the company uses cycle counts throughout the year to ensure accuracy within the warehouse management system 
seasonality our business is somewhat seasonal in that the company s sales volume is heavier around the first of the calendar month in addition to the peak christmas selling season 
many of the customers who shop at fred stores rely on government aid  social security  and other means that are typically paid at the first of the month 
these governmental payment cycles  coupled with the distribution of our newspaper advertising circular are major factors in concentrating sales earlier in the calendar month 
the following table reflects the seasonality of net sales  gross profit  operating income  and net income by quarter for the year ended st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter february  net sales gross profit operating profit net income january  net sales gross profit operating profit net income january  net sales gross profit operating profit net income employees at february   the company had approximately  full time and  part time employees  the majority of which are store employees 
the number of employees varies during the year  reaching a peak during the christmas selling season  which typically begins after the thanksgiving holiday 
the memphis  tennessee distribution center employees are represented by a union  unite here  pursuant to a three year collective bargaining agreement 
the current bargaining agreement went into effect on july  the company believes that it continues to have good relations with all of its employees 
competition the discount retail merchandise business is highly competitive 
we compete in respect to price  store location  in stock consistency  merchandise quality  assortment and presentation  and customer service with many national  regional and local retailing establishments  including department stores  discount stores  variety stores  dollar stores  discount clothing stores  drug stores  grocery stores  outlet stores  convenience stores  warehouse stores and other stores 
our competitors range from smaller  growing companies to considerably larger retail businesses that have greater financial  distribution  marketing and other resources than we do 
there is no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with them in the future 
see cautionary statement regarding forward looking information and item a risk factors 
government regulation as a publicly traded company  we are subject to numerous federal securities laws and regulations  including the securities act of and the securities exchange act of  and related rules and regulations promulgated by the securities and exchange commission sec  as well as the sarbanes oxley act of and the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act 
these laws and regulations impose significant requirements in the areas of accounting and financial reporting  corporate governance and insider trading  among others 
each of our locations must comply with regulations adopted by federal and state agencies regarding licensing  health  sanitation  safety  fire and other regulations 
in addition  we must comply with the fair labor standards act and various state laws governing various matters such as minimum wage  overtime and other working conditions 
we must also comply with provisions of the americans with disabilities act of  as amended  which requires generally that employers provide reasonable accommodation for employees with disabilities and that our stores be accessible to customers with disabilities 
the company s pharmacy department  in particular  is subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations 
licensure and regulation of retail pharmacies there are extensive federal and state regulations applicable to the practice of pharmacy at the retail level 
we are subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations concerning the protection of confidential patient medical records and information  including the federal health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa 
most states have laws and regulations governing the operation and licensing of pharmacies  and regulate standards of professional practice by pharmacy providers 
these regulations are issued by an administrative body in each state  typically a pharmacy board  which is empowered to impose sanctions for non compliance 
additionally  the drug enforcement agency dea requires that controlled substances be monitored and controlled at all times 
as a provider of medicare prescription drug plan benefits  we are subject to various federal regulations promulgated by the center for medicare and medicaid services under the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of in the future we may also be subject to changes to various state and federal insurance laws and regulations in connection with the company s pharmacy operations 
healthcare initiatives legislative and regulatory initiatives pertaining to such healthcare related issues as reimbursement policies  payment practices  therapeutic substitution programs  and other healthcare cost containment issues are frequently introduced at both the state and federal level 
the patient protection and affordable care act of may affect our pharmacy business  but due to the breadth and complexity of the act  the current lack of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance  and the phased in nature of the implementation  we are not yet able to judge what that impact might be 
the company is unable to predict accurately whether or when additional legislation may be enacted or regulations may be adopted relating to the company s pharmacy operations or what the effect of such legislation or regulations may be 
substantial compliance the company s management believes the company is in substantial compliance with all existing statutes and regulations material to the operation of the company s businesses and is unaware of any material non compliance action against the company 
environmental matters we are not aware of any federal  state or local environmental laws or regulations that will materially affect our earnings or competitive position  or result in material capital expenditures 
however  we cannot predict the effect on our operations of possible future environmental legislation or regulations 
during fiscal year  we did not incur any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures are anticipated

item a 
risk factors investors are encouraged to carefully consider the risks described below and other information contained in this document when considering an investment decision with respect to fred securities 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to management  or that management currently deems immaterial  may also impair the company s business operations 
any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur 
if one or more of these events do occur  business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in that instance  the trading price of fred securities could decline  and investors might lose all or part of their investment 
our business is somewhat seasonal 
we typically realize a significant portion of our net sales during the christmas selling season in the fourth quarter in addition to the heavier sales volume we experience around the first of the calendar month 
our inventories and short term borrowings  if required  increase in anticipation of this holiday season 
a seasonal merchandise inventory imbalance could result if for any reason our net sales during the christmas selling season were to fall below seasonal norms 
if for any reason our fourth quarter results were substantially below expectations  our profitability and operating results could be adversely affected by unanticipated markdowns  especially in seasonal merchandise 
we operate in a competitive industry 
we are in a highly competitive sector of the discount retail industry 
this competitive environment subjects us to the risk of reduced profitability because of lower prices  and lower margins  required to maintain our competitive position 
we compete with discount stores and with many other retailers all of which may operate a pharmacy not typically seen in our drug store competition  including department stores  variety stores  dollar stores  discount clothing stores  drug stores  grocery stores  outlet stores  convenience stores  warehouse stores and other stores  some of whom may have greater resources than we do 
this competitive environment subjects us to various risks  including the ability to continue to provide competitively priced merchandise to our customers that will allow us to maintain profitability and continue store growth 
some of our competitors utilize aggressive promotional activities  advertising programs  and pricing discounts and our results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not respond effectively to these efforts 
changes to current dividend payments could adversely affect the market price of our stock 
our ability to pay dividends is dependent upon the success of our operations and the management of our cash flows 
we cannot provide assurance that the company will continue to pay dividends at our current levels 
if we fail to maintain dividends at the current levels  the market price of our stock could be adversely affected 
changes in third party reimbursements  including government programs  could adversely affect our business 
a significant portion of our sales are funded by federal and state governments and private insurance plans 
for the years ended february  and january   pharmaceutical sales were and of total sales  respectively 
the health care industry is experiencing a trend toward cost containment with governments and private insurance plans seeking to impose lower reimbursements and utilization restrictions 
payments made under such programs may not remain at levels comparable to the present levels or be sufficient to cover our cost 
private insurance plans may base their reimbursement rates on the government rates 
accordingly  reimbursements may be limited or reduced  thereby adversely affecting our revenues and cash flows 
also access to existing and or new patients may be hindered or prevented through the implementation of preferred or restricted pharmacy provider networks ultimately impacting the financial results of the pharmacy department 
additionally  and in light of a worsening economy and recent healthcare legislation known as the patient protection and affordable care act of which includes provisions to be implemented in january that are specific to our pharmacy department  government or private insurance plans may adjust scheduled reimbursement payments to us in amounts that could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and financial condition 
on april   express scripts  inc express scripts completed its acquisition of medco health solutions  inc medco  creating the largest pharmacy benefit manager pbm in the united states 
prescriptions for both express scripts and medco are filled in our pharmacies 
the creation of this pbm  the largest in the united states  could adversely affect the profitability of prescriptions covered by the newly combined pbm as well as others as they react to increasing market pressures 
changes in consumer demand and product mix and changes in overall economic conditions could adversely affect our business 
our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing customer demands and preferences for product mix 
a general slowdown in the united states economy  rising personal debt levels  rising foreclosure rates  rising fuel prices  or changes in government aid  social security  and other means that many of our customers rely upon may adversely affect the spending of our consumers  which would likely result in lower net sales than expected on a quarterly or annual basis 
in addition  changes in the types of products available for sale and the selection of products by our customers affect sales  product mix and margins 
future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income  such as employment levels  business conditions  fuel and energy costs  inflation  interest rates  and tax rates  could also adversely affect our business by reducing consumer spending or causing consumers to shift their spending to other products 
we might be unable to anticipate these buying patterns and implement appropriate inventory strategies  which would adversely affect our sales and gross profit performance 
in addition  increases in fuel and energy costs would increase our transportation costs and overall cost of doing business and could adversely affect our financial statements as a whole 
natural disasters or unusually adverse weather conditions could affect our business 
unusually adverse weather conditions  natural disasters or similar disruptions  could significantly reduce our net sales 
in addition  these disruptions could also adversely affect our supply chain efficiency and make it more difficult for us to obtain sufficient quantities of merchandise from suppliers 
a number of our stores are located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes and tornadoes 
a significant disruption in our computer systems could adversely affect our business 
we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory  process customer transactions and record results 
our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages  telecommunications failures  computer viruses  security breaches and natural disasters 
if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly  we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them  and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
if we fail to protect the security of personal information about our customer  we could be subject to costly government enforcement actions or private litigation and our reputation could suffer 
the nature of our business involves the receipt of personal information about our customers 
if we experience a data security breach  we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation 
in addition  our customers could lose confidence in our ability to protect their personal information  which could cause them to discontinue usage of credit cards in our stores  decline to use our pharmacy department services  or stop shopping at our stores altogether 
such events could lead to lost future sales and adversely affect our results of operations 
merchandise supply and pricing and the interruption of and dependence on imports could adversely affect our business 
we have maintained good relations with our vendors and believe that we are generally able to obtain attractive pricing and other terms from vendors 
we purchase a portion of our inventory from foreign suppliers  principally in china 
as a result  political instability or other events resulting in the disruption of trade from other countries or the imposition of additional regulations relating to duties on imports could cause significant delays or interruptions in the supply of our merchandise or increase our costs 
also  our cost of goods is affected by the fluctuation of local currencies against the dollar in countries where these goods are produced 
accordingly  changes in the value of the dollar relative to foreign currencies may increase our cost of goods sold and  if we are unable to pass such cost increases on to our customers  decrease our gross margins and ultimately our earnings 
we purchase a significant amount of goods from procter and gamble and several large import vendors and any disruption in that supply and or pricing of such merchandise could negatively impact our operations and results 
delays and costs of operating new stores and distribution facilities could have an adverse impact on our business 
we maintain two distribution facilities in our geographic territory  and plan on constructing new facilities as needed to support our growth 
one of our key business strategies is to expand our base of retail stores 
we plan on expanding and refreshing our network of stores through new store openings and remodeling existing stores each year 
delays in opening  refreshing or remodeling stores or delays in opening distribution facilities to service those new stores could adversely affect our future operations by slowing growth  which may in turn reduce revenue and margin growth 
adverse changes in the cost to operate distribution facilities and stores  such as changes in labor  utilities  fuel and transportation  and other operating costs  could have an adverse impact on us 
operational difficulties could disrupt our business 
our stores are managed through a network of geographically dispersed management personnel 
our inability to effectively and efficiently operate our stores  including the ability to control losses resulting from inventory shrinkage  may negatively impact our sales and or margin 
in addition  we rely upon our distribution and logistics network to provide goods to stores in a timely and cost effective manner  any disruption  unanticipated expense or operational failure related to this process could negatively impact store operations 
our operation depends on a variety of information technology systems for the efficient functioning of its business 
we rely on certain software vendors to maintain and upgrade these systems as needed 
we rely on telecommunications carriers to gather and disseminate our operations information 
the disruption or failure of these systems or carriers could negatively impact our operations 
use of a single supplier of pharmaceutical products and our ability to negotiate satisfactory terms could adversely affect our business 
we have a long term supply contract from a single supplier  amerisourcebergen  for our pharmaceutical operations 
any significant disruption in our relationship with this supplier  deterioration in their financial condition  changes in terms  or an industry wide change in wholesale business practices  including those of our supplier or the manufacturers our supplier transacts business with  could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
higher than expected costs and not achieving our targeted results associated with the implementation of new programs  systems and technology could adversely affect our business 
we are undertaking a variety of operating initiatives as well as store upgrades and infrastructure initiatives 
the failure to properly execute any of these initiatives could have an adverse impact on our future operating results 
changes in state or federal legislation or regulations  including the effects of legislation and regulations on wage levels and entitlement programs  trade restrictions  tariffs  quotas and freight rates could adversely affect our business 
unanticipated changes in federal or state wage requirements or other changes in workplace regulation could adversely impact our ability to achieve our financial targets 
changes in trade restrictions  new tariffs and quotas  and higher shipping costs for goods could also adversely impact our ability to achieve anticipated operating results 
we depend on the success of our new store opening program  including increasing our pharmacy department presence in new and existing stores  for a portion of our growth 
our growth is dependent on both increases in sales in existing stores and the ability to open new stores with pharmacy departments 
unavailability of store locations that we deem desirable  delays in the acquisition of pharmacies or opening of new stores  difficulties in staffing and operating new store locations and the lack of customer acceptance of stores in expanded market areas all may negatively impact our new store growth  the costs associated with new stores and or the profitability of new stores 
our ability to renew or enter into new leases on favorable terms could affect costs of operations or slow store expansions 
changes in our ability to attract and retain employees  and changes in health care and other insurance costs could adversely affect our business 
our growth could be adversely impacted by our inability to attract and retain employees at the store operations level  in distribution facilities  and at the corporate level  including our senior management team 
adverse changes in health care costs could also adversely impact our ability to achieve our operational and financial goals and to offer attractive benefit programs to our employees 
adverse impacts associated with legal proceedings and claims could affect our business 
we are a party to a variety of legal proceedings and claims  including those described elsewhere in this annual report 
operating results could be adversely impacted if legal proceedings and claims against us are made  requiring the payment of cash in connection with those proceedings or changes to the operation of the business 
we may be subject to product liability claims 
despite our best efforts to ensure the quality and safety of the products we sell  we may be subject to product liability claims from customers or penalties from government agencies relating to products  including food products that are recalled  defective or otherwise alleged to be harmful 
such claims may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties  product contamination or spoilage  including the presence of foreign objects  substances  chemicals  other agents  or residues introduced during the growing  storage  handling and transportation phases 
all of our vendors and their products must comply with applicable product and food safety laws 
we generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our suppliers 
however  if we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available  such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
our ability to obtain indemnification from foreign suppliers may be hindered by the manufacturers lack of understanding of us product liability or other laws  which may make it more likely that we be required to respond to claims or complaints from customers as if we were the manufacturer of the products 
even with adequate insurance and indemnification  such claims could significantly damage our reputation and consumer confidence in our products 
our litigation expenses could increase as well  which also could have a materially negative impact on our results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued 
our ability to achieve the results of store closures under our strategic plan initiatives could adversely affect our business 
as part of our continuing operations  we perform research and analysis to discover potential underperforming stores 
we use such research and analysis to identify potential store closures 
the estimated costs and charges associated with these initiatives may vary materially and adversely based upon various factors  including the timing of execution  the outcome of negotiations with landlords and other third parties  or unexpected costs  any of which could result in our not realizing the anticipated benefits from the strategic plan 
increases in our insurance related costs could significantly affect our business 
the costs of many types of insurance and self insurance  especially workers compensation  employee health care and others  have been increasing in recent years due to rising health care costs  legislative changes  economic conditions  terrorism and heightened scrutiny of insurance brokers and insurance providers 
our pharmacy departments are also exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products  including with respect to improper filling of prescriptions  labeling of prescriptions and adequacy of warnings  and are significantly dependent upon suppliers to provide safe  government approved and non counterfeit products 
we also sell a variety of products that we purchase from a large number of suppliers  including some who operate in foreign countries  which could become subject to contamination  product tampering  mislabeling or other damage 
while we maintain reasonable quality assurance practices  no program can provide complete assurance that a product liability issue will not arise 
should a product liability issue arise  the coverage limits under our insurance programs may not be adequate to protect us against future claims 
in addition  we may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future 
damage to our reputation in the event of a product liability issue could have an adverse affect on our business 
if our insurance related costs increase significantly  or we are unable to renew our insurance policies or protect against all the business risks facing us  our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected 
in  congress passed the ppaca  which will result in significant structural changes to the health insurance system 
many of these changes will not be implemented until  and several of the resulting regulations and sub regulatory guidance have yet to be issued and or finalized 
as a result  uncertainties exist regarding the full impact of this act on our business 
the reforms will affect the healthcare coverage and plans of fred employees as well as our pharmacy department customers 
we cannot predict what  if any  effect the ppaca may have on our pharmacy department business  insurance costs or labor 
we also cannot predict other legislative or market driven changes within the health care system that could affect our business 
adverse impacts associated with the current economic environment could affect our business 
the lingering economic downturn could have an adverse impact of our business and profitability 
many consumers have suffered financial hardship as a result of job losses  foreclosures  or their inability to obtain short term financing  all of which could negatively affect their ability to shop in our stores and buy our products 
additionally  decreased consumer demand resulting from a pronounced negative consumer sentiment and an increasing personal savings rate could also negatively affect our sales and profits 
also  our ability to obtain financing  should the need arise outside of our current contractual credit facility  could be at risk due to tightened lending practices resulting from the continuing economic challenges in the united states

store locations range in size from  square feet to  square feet 
of the locations we lease  are in strip centers or adjacent to a downtown shopping district  with the remainder being freestanding 
it is anticipated that existing buildings and buildings to be developed by others will be available for lease to satisfy the company s expansion program in the near term 
it is management s intention to enter into leases of relatively moderate length with renewal options  rather than entering into long term leases 
the company will thus have maximum relocation flexibility in the future  since continued availability of existing buildings is anticipated in the company s market areas

the company believes that all of its assistant managers have been properly paid and that the matter is not appropriate for collective action treatment 
the company is and will continue to vigorously defend this matter  however  it is not possible to predict whether chapman will ultimately be able to proceed collectively and no assurances can be given that the company will be successful in the defense of the action on the merits or otherwise

additionally  we experienced double digit comparable sales decreases in our tobacco category in the first half of to address those trends  we finalized agreements with two major suppliers in the second and third quarters of that gives fred s more aggressive promotional capabilities in addition to new tobacco in store signage which was rolled out to our stores in the second half of at fiscal year end  comparable store sales in our tobacco category improved from previous low double digit decreases to a single digit decrease over fiscal during the year  our gross margin improved basis points to of sales in from of sales in gross margin was favorably impacted by the higher initial markup from the pharmacy department s brand to generic shift as well as increases in pharmacy department rebates 
operating margin for the week year deleveraged basis points 
the shortfall resulted from the deleveraging of selling  general and administrative expenses  primarily attributed to depreciation and amortization related to new pharmacy acquisitions 
also contributing to the shortfall was the deleveraging of other pharmacy department expenses driven by the brand to generic sales shift and higher insurance costs 
in our most recent press release  we announced the launch of our three year reconfiguration plan to regain momentum we had in the prior three years in driving toward our operating margin goal 
the main focus of our reconfiguration plan is to improve our overall store productivity and space efficiency while enhancing the product selection in stores with pharmacies 
the plan has two fundamental principles  to aggressively accelerate our pharmacy department presence and to improve our general merchandise space efficiency and productivity 
the reconfiguration plan in our general merchandise business is centered on expanding space in discretionary product lines 
in the third and fourth quarter of  we began testing our reconfiguration plan by reallocating space in stores to allow for an expanded hardware and auto department 
these test stores returned results that exceeded our plan by delivering comparable store sales increases basis points to basis points above the remainder of the chain 
by the end of  we expect to have approximately of our stores reset with the expanded hardware and auto format 
in stores with pharmacies  our general merchandise product offerings will be tailored to appeal to the pharmacy customer and will include the expansion of health and beauty aids  cosmetics  eye care  vitamins  pain relief and durable medical equipment 
over the next three years of the plan  we will reconfigure to of our selling square feet from less productive categories on a sales per square foot and gross margin per square foot basis to more productive categories 
the goal of these changes is to shift our general merchandise business to a healthier balance between higher gross margin discretionary product lines and lower margin consumable products lines while accelerating our pharmacy department and healthcare services offerings 
we believe these efforts can improve overall store productivity and space efficiency and enhance product selection in stores with pharmacies 
our pharmacy department is a key differentiating factor from other small box discount retailers 
it is one of our core categories and a primary component of our three year reconfiguration plan 
overall  the pharmacy department produced strong results in the year  with higher comparable prescription counts and increased gross margins 
during the year  our pharmacy department continued to experience sales pressure from the large brand to generic drug conversions that occurred throughout  as well as on going challenges in third party reimbursements 
although the sales impact of the brand to generic drug conversion is negative  the gross margin of generic drugs is typically higher than brand drugs 
unadjusted for the rd week in  comparable script growth increased and overall scripts increased over last year 
during  new pharmacies were opened  and three pharmacies were closed in existing locations  totaling pharmacy locations at year end 
this emphasis on growth was a major factor in the year to date pharmacy department sales increase as a percentage of sales of basis points to from in the same period last year 
continuing to accelerate pharmacy department growth is a key component of our reconfiguration plan 
under the reconfiguration plan  we will focus on increasing our pharmacy department penetration to to of our store base from the current over the next three years 
to achieve this goal  we will concentrate on adding pharmacies to existing stores without pharmacy departments  open all new stores with a pharmacy department and make opportunistic acquisitions that will operate as xpress pharmacy locations until they become a future full service location 
this growth in pharmacy department locations will position us to expand our specialty pharmacy program in  the fastest growing segment of the pharmacy industry 
specialty medications are high cost drugs that are used to treat chronic or rare conditions such as cancer  multiple sclerosis  rheumatoid arthritis and other complex diseases 
during  we entered into a vendor agreement with diplomat specialty pharmacy to provide clinical and patient administration services necessary to manage our patients that are receiving specialty medications 
launched in  the core program continues to be a long term strategy designed to highlight key categories within our stores that differentiate us from our competition 
the core categories are pet  household supplies  celebration  home and pharmacy and are strong trip driving departments in which fred s has a clear and marketable advantage versus small box competitors 
since the program launched  we have remodeled approximately of our locations with the core layout 
we continue to see improvement in stores that have been reformatted with the core layout  especially in the pet  household supplies and pharmacy departments 
in addition to the launch of our three year reconfiguration plan  other key initiatives in include beginning the implementation of the second phase of our price optimization tool which will aid us in managing our promotional markdowns and enhancing gross margins 
we will also continue to broaden our food and beverage assortment by adding new coolers in our top stores in order to add additional branded frozen and refrigerated products 
we also plan to expand brands across a number of categories including softlines  toys  automotive and hardware and lawn and garden 
we will continue our focus on improving store productivity through the core program  finding ways to help our financially challenged customer  building customer loyalty and focusing on initiatives aimed at driving operating margin improvement 
our markets  primarily southeastern us rural towns  have been hard hit by high unemployment  fuel price increases and inflation 
to help our financially challenged customer  we have focused our merchandising and marketing teams on key initiatives such as adding new value priced items  introducing new financial services and expanding our fred s brand products 
the expanded financial services department carries prepaid and reloadable phone  gift  entertainment  debit and credit cards 
we also provide western union services in some stores 
we will continue expanding these programs over the remainder of the year 
our fred s brand initiative continues to be a key strategy for the company in terms of building customer loyalty and increasing gross margin 
as of february   our fred s brand penetration rate was of consumable product sales  which is up basis points over last year 
our commitment to quality in our fred s brand products is resonating with our customers  and they continue to make the switch to our fred s brand 
we are continuing to add new products to our own brand line on an ongoing basis and have seen significant penetration in our fred s branded paper  pet  health aids and automotive categories 
the launch of the fred s loyalty card  called smartcard  during the second quarter  rewards customers for qualifying purchases  primarily purchases of fred s brand products 
since the launch of the smartcard  we ve had approximately million activated cards with approximately of those customers with enrolled accounts 
the information gained from the usage of the smartcard will be used to grow our loyal customer base and to direct the use of promotional funds towards those customers 
as previously published in our fourth quarter press release filed march   the company expects total sales in to increase in the range of to  or to excluding the rd week in comparable store sales are expected to be flat to an increase of in  excluding the rd week in we anticipate positive general merchandise comparable store sales throughout the pharmacy department comparable store sales are expected to remain negative through the first two quarters of due to the brand to generic shift  and we expect pharmacy department comparable store sales to turn positive by the end of the year as the large generic drug shift of is anniversaried 
we plan to open in the range of to new stores and to new pharmacies in and close approximately stores and pharmacies 
capital expenditures are planned in the range of million to million with an additional million to million planned for the acquisition of pharmacies 
based on this outlook  the company expects total earnings per diluted share to be in the range of to 
key factors that will be critical to the company s future success include the successful performance of our reconfiguration plan  as well as managing the strategy for opening new stores and pharmacies 
the successful opening of new stores and pharmacies includes the ability to open and operate efficiently  maintaining high standards of customer service  maximizing efficiencies in the supply chain  controlling working capital needs through improved inventory turnover  controlling the effects of inflation or deflation  controlling product mix  increasing operating margin through improved gross margin and leveraging operating costs and generating adequate cash flow to fund the company s future needs 
critical accounting policies the preparation of fred financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments in the reporting of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are applicable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
while we believe that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the consolidated financial statements  the company cannot guarantee that the estimates and assumptions will be accurate under different conditions and or assumptions 
the critical accounting policies presented are those policies the company has identified as having both a highly subjective component and a material impact on the financial statements 
these policies are intended to supplement the summary of our critical accounting policies and related estimates and judgments found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our most critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition 
the company markets goods and services through company owned stores and franchised stores as of february  net sales include sales of merchandise from company owned stores  net of estimated returns and exclusive of sales taxes 
sales to franchised stores are recorded when the merchandise is shipped from the company s warehouse 
revenues resulting from layaway sales are recorded upon delivery of the merchandise to the customer 
the company also sells gift cards for which the revenue is recognized at time of redemption 
the company records a gift card liability on the date the gift card is issued to the customer 
revenue is recognized and the gift card liability is reduced as the customer redeems the gift card 
the company will recognize aged liabilities as revenue when the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote gift card breakage 
the company has not recognized any revenue from gift card breakage since the inception of the program in and does not expect to record any gift card breakage revenue until there is more certainty regarding our ability to retain such amounts in light of current consumer protection and state escheatment laws 
in addition  the company charges the franchised stores a fee based on a percentage of their purchases from the company 
these fees represent a reimbursement for use of the fred name and other administrative costs incurred on behalf of the franchised stores and are therefore netted against selling  general and administrative expenses 
total franchise income for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
inventories 
merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the retail first in  first out fifo method for goods in our stores and the cost first in  first out method for goods in our distribution centers 
the retail inventory method is a reverse mark up  averaging method which has been widely used in the retail industry for many years 
this method calculates a cost to retail ratio that is applied to the retail value of inventory to determine the cost value of inventory and the resulting cost of goods sold and gross margin 
the assumption that the retail inventory method provides for valuation at lower of cost or market and the inherent uncertainties therein are discussed in the following paragraphs 
in order to assure valuation at the lower of cost or market  the retail value of our inventory is adjusted on a consistent basis to reflect current market conditions 
these adjustments include increases to the retail value of inventory for initial markups to set the selling price of goods or additional markups to adjust pricing for inflation and decreases to the retail value of inventory for markdowns associated with promotional  seasonal or other declines in the market value 
because these adjustments are made on a consistent basis and are based on current prevailing market conditions  they approximate the carrying value of the inventory at net realizable value market value 
therefore  after applying the cost to retail ratio  the cost value of our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market as is prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles in the us us gaap 
because the approximation of net realizable value under the retail inventory method is based on estimates such as markups  markdowns and inventory losses shrink  there exists an inherent uncertainty in the final determination of inventory cost and gross margin 
in order to mitigate that uncertainty  the company has a formal review by product class which considers such variables as current market trends  seasonality  weather patterns and age of merchandise to ensure that markdowns are taken currently  or a markdown reserve is established to cover future anticipated markdowns 
this review also considers current pricing trends and inflation to ensure that markups are taken if necessary 
the estimation of inventory losses is a significant element in approximating the carrying value of inventory at net realizable value  thus the following paragraph describes our estimation method as well as the steps we take to mitigate the risk this estimate has in the determination of the cost value of inventory 
the company calculates inventory losses based on actual inventory losses occurring as a result of physical inventory counts during each fiscal period and estimated inventory losses occurring between yearly physical inventory counts 
the estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical counts is calculated on a store specific basis and is based on history  as well as performance on the most recent physical count 
it is calculated by multiplying each store s shrink rate  which is based on the previously mentioned factors  by the interim period s sales for each store 
additionally  the overall estimate for shrink is adjusted at the corporate level to a three year historical average to ensure that the overall shrink estimate is the most accurate approximation of shrink based on the company s overall history of shrink 
the three year historical estimate is calculated by dividing the book to physical inventory adjustments for the trailing months by the related sales for the same period 
in order to reduce the uncertainty inherent in the shrink calculation  the company first performs the calculation at the lowest practical level by store using the most current performance indicators 
this ensures a more reliable number  as opposed to using a higher level aggregation or percentage method 
the second portion of the calculation ensures that the extreme negative or positive performance of any particular store or group of stores does not skew the overall estimation of shrink 
this portion of the calculation removes additional uncertainty by eliminating short term peaks and valleys that could otherwise cause the underlying carrying cost of inventory to fluctuate unnecessarily 
the methodology that we have applied in estimating shrink has resulted in variability in result that is not material to our financial statements 
the company has experienced improvement in reducing shrink as a percentage of sales from year to year due to improved inventory control measures  which includes the chain wide utilization of the nex dex technology 
management believes that the company s retail inventory method provides an inventory valuation which reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 
for pharmacy department inventories  which were approximately million  and million at february  and january   respectively  cost was determined using the retail lifo last in  first out method in which inventory cost is maintained using the retail inventory method  then adjusted by application of the highly inflationary producer price index published by the us department of labor for the cumulative annual periods 
the current cost of inventories exceeded the lifo cost by approximately million at february  and million at january  the lifo reserve increased by approximately million and million during and  respectively 
the company has historically included an estimate of inbound freight and certain general and administrative costs in merchandise inventory as prescribed by us gaap 
these costs include activities surrounding the procurement and storage of merchandise inventory such as merchandise planning and buying  warehousing  accounting  information technology and human resources  as well as inbound freight 
the total amount of procurement and storage costs and inbound freight included in merchandise inventory at february  is million compared to million at january  impairment 
the company s policy is to review the carrying value of all long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
in accordance with fasb asc  impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review for impairment all stores open at least years or remodeled more than years 
impairment results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows over the life of the lease or years for owned stores 
our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the lease term is based upon historical operations of the stores and estimates of future store profitability  which encompasses many factors that are subject to management s judgment and are difficult to predict 
if a long lived asset is found to be impaired  the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset s fair value 
the fair value is based on estimated market values for similar assets or other reasonable estimates of fair market value based upon using a discounted cash flow model 
exit and disposal activities 
lease termination lease obligations still exist for some store closures that occurred in we record the estimated future liability associated with the rental obligation on the cease use date when the stores were closed 
the lease obligations are established at the cease use date for the present value of any remaining operating lease obligations  net of estimated sublease income  and at the communication date for severance and other exit costs  as prescribed by fasb asc  exit or disposal cost obligations 
key assumptions in calculating the liability include the timeframe expected to terminate lease agreements  estimates related to the sublease potential of closed locations  and estimates of other related exit costs 
if actual timing and potential termination costs or realization of sublease income differ from our estimates  the resulting liabilities could vary from recorded amounts 
these liabilities are reviewed periodically and adjusted when necessary 
during fiscal  we reserved an additional million in rent expense related to the revision of the estimated amount of the remaining lease liability for the fiscal store closures 
we also utilized million  leaving million in the reserve at february in millions beginning balance january  additions fy utilized fy ending balance february  lease contract termination liability property and equipment and intangibles 
property and equipment are carried at cost 
depreciation is recorded using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets and presented in selling  general and administrative expenses 
improvements to leased premises are depreciated using the straight line method over the shorter of the initial term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement 
leasehold improvements added late in the lease term are depreciated over the lesser of the remaining term of the lease including the upcoming renewal option  if the renewal is reasonably assured or the useful life of the improvement 
gains or losses on the sale of assets are recorded at disposal as a component of operating income 
the following average estimated useful lives are generally applied estimated useful lives building and building improvements years furniture  fixtures and equipment years leasehold improvements years or term of lease  if shorter automobiles and vehicles years airplane years assets under capital lease are amortized in accordance with the company s normal depreciation policy for owned assets or over the lease term regardless of renewal options  if shorter  and the charge to earnings is included in depreciation expense in the consolidated financial statements 
other identifiable intangible assets  which are included in other noncurrent assets  primarily represent customer lists associated with acquired pharmacies 
based on the company s history of intangible asset acquisitions beginning in fiscal  these assets are being amortized on a straight line basis over five years until such time as the company s internal analysis has sufficient history to indicate another method is preferable 
vendor rebates and allowances and advertising costs 
the company receives rebates for a variety of merchandising activities  such as volume commitment rebates  relief for temporary and permanent price reductions  cooperative advertising programs  and for the introduction of new products in our stores 
in accordance with fasb asc customer payments and incentives  rebates received from a vendor are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold or a reduction to selling  general and administrative expenses if the reimbursement represents a specific incremental and identifiable cost 
should the allowance received exceed the incremental cost  then the excess is recorded as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold 
any excess amounts for the periods reported are immaterial 
any rebates received subsequent to merchandise being sold are recorded as a reduction to cost of goods sold when received 
as of february   the company had approximately  vendors who participate in vendor rebate programs  and the terms of the agreements with those vendors vary in length from short term arrangements to be completed within a month to longer term arrangements that could last up to three years 
in accordance with fasb asc advertising costs  the company charges advertising  including production costs  to selling  general and administrative expense on the first day of the advertising period 
gross advertising expenses for  and  were million  million and million  respectively 
gross advertising expenses were reduced by vendor cooperative advertising allowances of million  million and million  for  and  respectively 
it would be the company s intention to incur a similar amount of advertising expense as in prior years and in support of our stores even if we did not receive support from our vendors in the form of cooperative adverting programs 
insurance reserves 
the company is largely self insured for workers compensation  general liability and employee medical insurance 
the company s liability for self insurance is determined based on claims known at the time of determination of the reserve and estimates for future payments against incurred losses and claims that have been incurred but not reported 
estimates for future claims costs include uncertainty because of the variability of the factors involved  such as the type of injury or claim  required services by the providers  healing time  age of claimant  case management costs  location of the claimant  and governmental regulations such as the ppaca 
these uncertainties or a deviation in future claims trends from recent historical patterns could result in the company recording additional expenses or expense reductions that might be material to the company s results of operations 
the company s insurance policy coverage runs august through july of each fiscal year 
on august   the stop loss limits for excessive or catastrophic claims for general liability remained at  and employee medical remained at  the stop loss limit for worker s compensation remained unchanged at  the company s insurance reserve was million and million on february  and january   respectively 
changes in the reserve over that time period were attributable to additional reserve requirements of million netted with payments of million 
fair value of financial instruments 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the hierarchy  as defined below  gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
level  defined as quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date 
level  defined as inputs other than quoted prices included within level  that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
level  defined as unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
the recorded value of the company s financial instruments  which include cash and cash equivalents  receivables  accounts payable and indebtedness  approximates fair value 
the following methods and assumptions were used to estimate fair value of each class of financial instrument the carrying amounts of current assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments and the fair value of the company s indebtedness is estimated based on the current borrowing rates available to the company for bank loans with similar terms and average maturities 
most of our indebtedness is under variable interest rates 
income taxes 
the company reports income taxes in accordance with fasb asc  income taxes 
under fasb asc  the asset and liability method is used for computing future income tax consequences of events  which have been recognized in the company s consolidated financial statements or income tax returns 
deferred income tax expense or benefit is the net change during the year in the company s deferred income tax assets and liabilities see note income taxes 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
fasb asc  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
that is codified in fasb asc we adopted fasb asc as of february   the first day of fiscal this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb asc and prescribes a minimum recognition threshold of more likely than not to be sustained upon examination that a tax position must meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
under fasb asc  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
additionally  fasb asc provides guidance on de recognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition see note income taxes 
fasb asc further requires that interest and penalties required to be paid on the underpayment of taxes should be accrued on the difference between the amount claimed or expected to be claimed on the tax return and the tax benefit recognized in the financial statements 
the company includes potential interest and penalties recognized in accordance with fasb asc in the financial statements as a component of income tax expense 
accrued interest and penalties related to our unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet within other non current liabilities 
stock based compensation 
effective january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fasb asc  compensation stock compensation  using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  compensation expense recognized post adoption includes compensation expense for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with fasb asc  and compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc effective january   the company elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in fasb asc for calculating the income tax effects of stock based compensation 
the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the income tax effects of stock based compensation  and for determining the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the income tax effects of stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of fasb asc fasb asc also requires the benefits of income tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow 
the impact of adopting fasb asc on future results will depend on  among other things  levels of share based payments granted in the future  actual forfeiture rates and the timing of option exercises 
stock based compensation expense  post adoption of fasb asc  is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  and therefore has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on the company s historical forfeiture experience and will be revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
results of operations the following table provides a comparison of fred financial results for the past three years 
in this table  categories of income and expense are expressed as a percentage of sales 
for the year ended february  january  january  net sales cost of good sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense  net income before taxes income taxes net income cost of goods sold includes the cost of product sold  along with all costs associated with inbound freight 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs associated with purchasing  receiving  handling  securing and storing product 
these costs are associated with products that have been sold and no longer remain in ending inventory 
comparable stores sales 
a store is first included in comparable store sales after the end of the th month following the store grand opening month 
our calculation of comparable store sales represents the increase or decrease in net sales for these stores  and includes stores that have been remodeled or relocated during the reporting period 
the majority of our remodels and relocations do not include expansion 
the purpose of the remodel or the relocation is to change the store s layout  refresh the store with new fixtures  interiors or signage or to locate the store in a more desirable area 
this type of change to the store does not necessarily change the product mix or product departments  therefore  on a comparable store sales basis  the store is the same before and after the remodel or relocation 
in relation to remodels and relocations  expansions have been much more infrequent and consequently  any increase in the selling square footage is immaterial to the overall calculation of comparable store sales 
additionally  we do not exclude newly added hardline  softline or pharmacy departments from our comparable store sales calculation because we believe that all departments within a fred store create a synergy supporting our overall goals for managing the store  servicing our customer and promoting traffic and sales growth 
therefore  the introduction of all new departments is included in same store sales in the year in which the department is introduced 
likewise  our same store sales calculation is not adjusted for the removal of a department from a location 
fiscal compared to fiscal the following information contains references to years and  which represent fiscal years ended february  which was a week accounting period and january  which was a week accounting period

the company s front store non pharmacy sales increased over front store sales we experienced sales increases in categories such as food  paper and chemical  health and beauty aids  beverage and pet partially offset by decreases in tobacco  electronics and home furnishings 
the company s pharmacy department sales were of total sales in compared to of total sales in the prior year and continue to rank as the largest sales category within the company 
the total sales in this department increased over  with third party prescription sales representing approximately of total pharmacy department sales  the same as in the prior year 
the company s pharmacy department continues to benefit from an ongoing program of purchasing prescription files from independent pharmacies as well as the addition of pharmacy departments in existing store locations 
sales to fred franchised locations during declined to million of sales compared to million fiscal the decrease in year over year franchise sales was due to the impact of three franchise stores that closed during the year as well as the ongoing economic challenges affecting our customers disposable income 
the company does not intend to expand its franchise network 
the sales mix for the period  unadjusted for deferred layaway sales  was pharmaceuticals  household goods  food and tobacco  paper and cleaning supplies  health and beauty aids  apparel and linens  and franchise

selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses  including depreciation and amortization  increased to million in of sales from million in of sales 
this basis point expense deleveraging consisted primarily of basis points million for depreciation and amortization expense  which is mostly related to new pharmacy department growth  basis points million for all other pharmacy department expenses related to the negative impact of the brand to generic shift on top line sales as well as new pharmacy department growth and basis points million in higher insurance expense due to rising medical costs 
operating income operating income decreased to million in of sales from million in of sales due to an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of million as described in the selling  general and administrative expenses section above

excluding the impact of these favorable tax credits  the effective income tax rate for the year was in compared to in the company s estimates of income taxes and the significant items resulting in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and reflect the company s assessment of future tax consequences of transactions that have been reflected in the company s financial statements or tax returns for each taxing authority in which it operates 
actual income taxes to be paid could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or the outcome of audits completed by federal and state taxing authorities 
the reserves are determined based upon the company s judgment of the probable outcome of the tax contingencies and are adjusted  from time to time  based upon changing facts and circumstances 
state net operating loss carry forwards are available to reduce state income taxes in future years 
these carry forwards total approximately million for state income tax purposes at february  and expire at various times during through if certain substantial changes in the company s ownership should occur  there would be an annual limitation on the amount of carry forwards that can be utilized 
we have provided a reserve for the portion believed to be more likely than not to expire unused 
we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of to in fiscal net income net income decreased to million per diluted share in from million per diluted share in  a decrease of million 
the decrease in net income is primarily attributable to an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of million as described in the selling  general and administrative expenses section above 
this unfavorability was partially offset by million of higher gross profit driven by the higher initial markup from the pharmacy department s brand to generic shift as well as an increase pharmacy department rebates as described in the gross profit section above and million in lower tax expense driven by the favorable effective tax rate as described in the income taxes section above
