management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results

as of march   we operated stores in alabama  delaware  florida  georgia  illinois  indiana  kentucky  louisiana  maryland  mississippi  missouri  new jersey  north carolina  ohio  pennsylvania  south carolina  tennessee  virginia  west virginia  and wisconsin 
we operate in one reportable segment 
we do not have international operations 
references to fiscal years in this report relate to the respective month period ended march our fiscal year is the month period that ended on march  throughout our md a  we refer to comparable store sales 
comparable store sales is comprised of net sales at stores in operation for at least full months  including remodeled and relocated stores  as well as net sales for our website 
the method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry and our method of calculating comparable store sales may not be the same as other retailers methods 
this overview section is divided into four sub sections discussing our operating strategy and performance  store development strategy  business strategy and core philosophies and seasonality 
operating strategy and performance 
we focus the majority of our floor space  advertising expense and distribution infrastructure on the marketing  delivery and installation of a wide selection of premium appliance and video products 
we carry approximately models of major appliances in stock  and a large selection of tvs  consumer electronics  mattresses  computers and mobile products  home entertainment furniture  and fitness equipment 
appliance and video sales comprised and of our net sales mix for the twelve months ended march  and  respectively 
we strive to differentiate ourselves through our customer purchase experience starting with a highly trained  consultative commissioned sales force which educates our customers on the features and benefits of our products  followed by rapid product delivery and installation  and ending with post sales support services 
we carefully monitor our competition to ensure that our prices are competitive in the market place 
our experience has been that informed customers often choose to buy a more heavily featured product once they understand the applicability and benefits of its features 
heavily featured products typically carry higher average selling prices and higher margins than less featured  entry level price point products 
in response to the declines in our overall comparable store sales largely resulting from the performance of the video category  we have developed three major initiatives for fiscal  which are continuing to evolve our sales mix  expanding our base of customers and enhancing our service offerings 
our first initiative for fiscal is to reshape our sales mix through a continued increase in focus on the appliance category as well as the introduction of new products and categories 
our sales in the appliance category have increased on a 
table of contents comparative basis over the past seven quarters  and we have continued to gain market share in our markets 
to maintain this growth  we plan to continue to place greater emphasis on appliances in our marketing strategies and continue to improve on our service offerings within the category 
we also expect that as the us housing market and general economy continues to improve  the appliance industry will experience increases in demand 
additionally  during fiscal  we tested and launched new products and categories  including home entertainment furniture and home fitness products 
given the early success of these new categories  we plan to test additional furniture products in our stores including dinette sets and bedroom packages  as well as expanding the number of room packages in our stores 
the video category will continue to be an important category for us  but our emphasis will be on larger screen sizes and areas of the video category that we believe we can add value to the sale with our sales force 
within the video category  we plan to improve our balance of gross profit and market share through positioning our new assortment strategy 
our second initiative for fiscal is to expand our customer base through increased credit offerings  creating a new ad campaign and focusing greater attention on promoting compelling offers of consumer electronics to drive traffic to our stores 
over the past months  our non recourse private label credit card penetration has increased basis points to 
we continue to encourage the use of the card  not only through in store payment options  but through offers such as our discount on qualifying purchases 
in addition to our private label credit card  we also plan to roll out lease to own options through a third party provider to all stores by the end of the second fiscal quarter of fiscal this will allow us to offer credit offerings to customers who historically had been turned down for credit through our private label card 
additionally  we plan to test a secondary finance offering for the lower middle income consumer 
we believe that enhancing our credit offerings will generate greater brand loyalty  higher average sales per transaction  and increased premium service plan sales 
to supplement our initiatives to expand our customer base we selected a new advertising agency to assist us in delivering the marketing messages necessary to execute on our initiatives 
we plan to launch a new advertising campaign during the second fiscal quarter of we also plan to utilize innovations in consumer electronics to drive additional customer traffic 
our third initiative for fiscal is to enhance our service offerings  with particular emphasis on our website capabilities 
by partnering with a third party we expect to more than double our product assortment online through an expanded aisle 
we also plan to update our mobile commerce site by allowing greater functionality  including transacting through the site 
additionally  we plan to enhance the in store customer experience by implementing a new point of sale system  which will not only have new capabilities  but expedite the check out process to decrease the time to complete a sale 
we also plan to continue to improve our customer service by raising the standards of execution by our sales team members 
this will include reshaping our new hire training and our manager in training curriculum  as well as additional product training around our new product offerings 
along with additional training  we will also be adding tablet technology to our delivery drivers enabling greater communication between the delivery driver and customer 
we believe this will continue to differentiate us in our commitment to be best in class in home delivery and installation 
key metrics the following table summarizes certain operating data that we believe are important to an understanding of our operating model fiscal year ended march  inventory turnover x x x working capital as a percentage of net sales net capital expenditures as a percentage of net sales income from operations as a percentage of net sales inventory turnover for the specified period is calculated by dividing our cost of goods sold for the fiscal year by the average of the beginning and ending inventory for that period 
working capital represents current assets excluding customer deposits and the current portion of deferred income taxes less current liabilities as of the end of the respective fiscal year end  expressed as a percentage of net sales 
net capital expenditures represent capital expenditures less proceeds and deposits from sale and leaseback transactions  expressed as a percentage of net sales 
for the fiscal year ended march   income from operations includes million of life insurance proceeds 
we focus on leveraging our semi fixed expenditures in advertising  distribution and regional management through closely managing our inventory  working capital and store development expenditures 
our inventory has averaged turns per year over the past three fiscal years 
during fiscal  we rolled out new product categories of home entertainment furniture and fitness equipment  which elevated inventory levels as compared to the prior year 
our working capital  expressed as a 
table of contents percentage of net sales  has averaged over the past three fiscal years 
our net capital expenditures  measured as a percentage of net sales  have averaged over the past three fiscal years 
business strategy and core philosophies 
our business strategy is focused around offering our customers a superior customer purchase experience 
from the time the customers walk in the door  they experience a well designed  customer friendly store 
our stores are brightly lit and have clearly distinguished departments that allow our customers to find what they are looking for 
we greet and assist our customers with our highly trained consultative sales force  who educate the customers about the different product features 
we believe our products are rich in features and innovation 
we believe that customers find it helpful to have someone explain the features and benefits of a product as this assistance allows them the opportunity to buy the product that most closely matches their needs 
we focus our product assortment on big box items requiring in home delivery and installation in order to utilize service offerings 
we follow up on the customer purchase experience by offering next day delivery on many of our products and in home installation service 
while we believe many of our product offerings are considered essential items by our customers  other products and certain features are viewed as discretionary purchases 
as a result  our results of operations are susceptible to a challenging macro economic environment 
factors such as changes in consumer confidence  unemployment  consumer credit availability and the condition of the housing market have negatively impacted our core product categories and added volatility to our overall business 
as consumers show a more cautious approach to purchases of discretionary items  customer traffic and spending patterns continue to be difficult to predict 
by providing a knowledgeable consultative sales force  delivery capabilities  credit offerings and expanded product offerings  we believe we offer our customers a differentiated value proposition 
retail appliance sales are correlated to the housing industry and housing turnover 
as more people purchase existing homes in the market  appliance sales tend to trend upward 
conversely  when demand in the housing market declines  appliance sales is also negatively impacted 
the appliance industry has benefited from increased innovation in energy efficient products 
while these energy efficient products typically carry a higher average selling price than traditional products  they save the consumer significant dollars in annual energy savings 
average unit selling prices of major appliances are not expected to change dramatically in the foreseeable future 
the consumer electronics industry depends on new product innovations to drive sales and profitability 
innovative  heavily featured products are typically introduced at relatively high price points 
over time  price points are gradually reduced to drive consumption 
accordingly  there has been consistent price compression in flat panel televisions for equivalent screen sizes in recent years 
as new technology has not been sufficient to keep demand constant  the industry has seen falling demand  gross margin rate declines  and average selling price declines 
over the past few months  we have proactively shifted our focus towards larger screen sizes with higher profit margins  which has resulted in lost market share in the video category  as we offered fewer smaller screen size televisions 
in future years  we will continue to evaluate our mix of product offerings in the video category to maximize profit margins without significant loss of market share  while also featuring key opening price points to drive traffic 
other consumer electronics categories have also experienced significant demand pressure 
cameras  camcorders  mp players  and gps devices have been largely replaced by the use of smart phones 
as such  we continue to shift our product mix away from these categories and into the computing and mobile phone category 
in addition to testing new products in existing categories  we have also expanded into new product categories that fit our core competencies  including home entertainment furniture and fitness equipment 
we will continue to refine our assortment in these categories as we learn more about their success in our stores 
we expect to test various products such as other types of home furniture including  but not limited to  dinette sets and bedroom furniture 
we are also testing additional credit offerings for our consumers 
as over one third of our sales today are transacted on the hhgregg private label credit card  we want to be able to expand our consumer base to allow new consumers to shop in our stores 
we expect to add a lease to own program through a third party provider to all stores by the end of the fiscal second quarter of  and expect to test a secondary financing offer for the lower middle end income consumer 
we expect these programs will be non recourse to the company through the use of third party solutions 
store development strategy 
over the past several years  we have adhered closely to a development strategy of adding stores to metropolitan markets in clusters to achieve rapid market share penetration and more efficiently leverage our distribution network  advertising and regional management costs 
our expansion plans include looking for new markets where we believe there is significant underlying demand for stores  typically in areas that have historically demonstrated above average economic growth  strong household incomes and growth in new housing starts and or remodeling activity 
our markets 
table of contents typically include most or all of our major competitors 
we plan to continue to follow our approach of building store density in each major market and distribution area  which in the past has helped us to improve our market share and realize operating efficiencies 
our near term expectations will be to slow our store growth and shift the balance of our focus to sales and profit productivity in our existing store base 
we plan to focus our time and investments on enhancing our store productivity within our existing markets through growth in both new and existing product categories  as well as increasing our focus on large deliverable home products  along with growing our competencies with our e commerce platform 
we expect this short term reduction in the number of new store openings to favorably impact our results of operations as a result of the decrease in store opening costs 
additionally  we would expect modest declines in capital expenditures due to the decrease in new store capital expenditures 
we also expect to see a decline in our net sales growth as compared to previous years results due to fewer anticipated new store additions 
during the past twelve months  we opened new stores 
of the new store openings in fiscal  were opened in new markets or markets entered into last fiscal year  including champaign  springfield and chicago  illinois  new orleans  louisiana  st 
louis  missouri  pittsburgh  pennsylvania  and green bay and milwaukee  wisconsin 
seasonality 
our business is seasonal  with a higher portion of net sales  operating costs  and operating profit realized during the quarter that ends december due to the overall demand for consumer electronics during the holiday shopping season 
appliance sales is impacted by seasonal weather patterns  but is less seasonal than our electronics business and helps to offset the seasonality of our overall business
