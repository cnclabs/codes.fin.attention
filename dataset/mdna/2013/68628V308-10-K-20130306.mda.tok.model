we define ebitda as income before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
ebitda is used as a supplemental financial measure by our management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors  commercial banks and others  to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods  capital structure or historical cost basis  the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs and support our indebtedness  our operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other companies in our industry  without regard to financing or capital structure  and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities 
ebitda is not a presentation made in accordance with gaap 
ebitda should not be considered an alternative to  or more meaningful than  net income  operating income  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap as measures of operating performance  liquidity or ability to service debt obligations 
because ebitda excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income and is defined differently by different companies in our industry  our definition of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
ebitda has important limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes beginning on page f of this annual report on form k 
certain statements made in our discussion may be forward looking 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and a number of factors could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from our expectations 
see forward looking statements at the beginning of this annual report on form k for additional discussion of some of these risks and uncertainties 
unless the context requires otherwise  when we refer to we  us and our  we are describing orion marine group  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 
overview we are a leading marine specialty contractor serving the heavy civil marine infrastructure market 
we provide a broad range of marine construction and specialty services on  over and under the water along the gulf coast  the atlantic seaboard  the west coast  canada and the caribbean basin  as well as have a presence in australia and the middle east 
our customers include federal  state and municipal governments  the combination of which accounted for approximately of our revenue in the year ended december   as well as private commercial and industrial enterprises 
we are headquartered in houston  texas 
recap and outlook in  our backlog recovered substantially from the levels experienced in we were successful in winning work through a strategic decision to drive volume to offset lower job margins 
in addition  we completed an acquisition of assets in alaska  which expanded our presence in the pacific northwest area and provided greater opportunities in both the private and governmental sectors 
our overall outlook for remains optimistic 
our tracking database of future projects of interest remains strong for the foreseeable future 
we continue to see new bid opportunities in the private sector  reflecting increases in capital projects  both in new construction and refurbishment of existing infrastructure 
bridge projects funded by various state departments of transportation  as well as projects led by local port authorities  continue to be let at normal levels 
however  current and future lettings from the us army corps of engineers remain inconsistent and uncertain  which continues to put pressure on the utilization of our dredging assets 
in the long term  we see positive trends in demands for our services in our end markets  including general demand to repair and improve degrading us marine infrastructure  language in the transportation bill urging action for resolution of the discrepancy between harbor maintenance tax collections and expenditures  renewed focus on coastal rehabilitation along the gulf coast expected increases in cargo volume and future demands from larger ships transiting the panama canal will require ports along the gulf coast and atlantic seaboard to perform additional dredging services and expand port infrastructure  and improving economic conditions and increased activity in the petrochemical industry will necessitate capital expenditures  including larger projects  which had been postponed  as well as maintenance call out work 
our focus in will be to concentrate on our core business objectives  to manage our business effectively and efficiently  continue to maintain a strong backlog while maintaining our pricing discipline  to closely monitor the costs of our operations  and to maintain our strong balance sheet 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect both the company s carrying values of its assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
although our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition we enter into construction contracts principally on the basis of competitive bids 
although the terms of our contracts vary considerably  most are made on a fixed price basis 
revenues from construction contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method measures the ratio of costs incurred and accrued to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for each contract at completion 
this requires us to prepare on going estimates of the costs to complete each contract as the project progresses 
in preparing these estimates  we make significant judgments and assumptions concerning our significant cost drivers of materials  labor and equipment  and we evaluate contingencies based on possible schedule variances  production delays or other productivity factors 
actual costs may vary from the costs we estimated 
variations from estimated contract costs along with other risks inherent in fixed price contracts may result in actual revenue and gross profits differing from those we estimated and could result in losses on projects 
if a current estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss on a contract  the projected loss is recognized in full when determined  without regard to the percentage of completion 
we consider unapproved change orders to be contract variations on which we have customer approval for scope change  but not for price associated with that scope change 
these costs are included in the estimated cost to complete the contracts and are expensed as incurred 
we recognize revenue equal to cost incurred on unapproved change orders when realization of price approval is probable and the estimated amount is equal to or greater than our cost related to the unapproved change order and the related margin when the change order is formally approved by the customer 
revenue recognized on unapproved change orders is included in contract costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts on the balance sheet 
we consider claims to be amounts that we seek or will seek to collect from customers or others for customer caused changes in contract specifications or design  or other customer related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs on which there is no agreement with customers on both scope and price changes 
revenue from claims is recognized when agreement is reached with customers as to the value of the claims  which in some instances may not occur until after completion of work under the contract 
costs associated with claims are included in the estimated costs to complete the contracts and are expensed when incurred 
depending on the size of a particular project  variations from estimated project costs could have a significant impact on our operating results for any fiscal quarter or year 
we believe our exposure to losses on fixed price contracts is limited by the relatively short duration of the contracts we undertake and our management s experience in estimating contract costs 
long lived assets our long lived assets consist primarily of equipment used in our operations 
fixed assets are carried at cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives  ranging from one to thirty years  using the straight line method for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for tax reporting purposes 
the carrying value of our long lived assets is evaluated periodically based on utilization of the asset and physical condition of the asset  as well as the useful life of the asset to determine if adjustment to the depreciation period or the carrying value is warranted 
if events and circumstances such as poor utilization or deteriorated physical condition indicate that the asset s should be reviewed for possible impairment  we use projections to assess whether future cash flows  including disposition  on a non discounted basis related to the tested assets are likely to exceed the recorded carrying amount of those assets to determine if an impairment exists 
if we identify a potential impairment  we will estimate the fair value of the asset through known market transactions of similar equipment and other valuation techniques  which could include the use of similar projections on a discounted basis 
we will report a loss to the extent that the carrying value of the impaired assets exceeds their fair values 
goodwill we have acquired businesses and assets in purchase transactions that resulted in the recognition of goodwill 
in accordance with us gaap  acquired goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset more likely than not may be impaired 
goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets is subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset more likely than not may be impaired 
we evaluate goodwill at the reporting unit level 
we have determined that we have three reporting units  which are based on geography  and are referred to internally as east coast  gulf coast and pacific northwest 
each reporting unit conducts similar business as described in this annual report on form k  which includes marine construction specialty services 
this reporting unit grouping reflects our internal management structure  which is based on the geographic location of our primary field offices 
at december   goodwill totaled million  of which million related to the gulf coast  million resulted from the acquisition of equipment on the east coast  and million resulted from the acquisition of assets and a business in anchorage  alaska on october  
table of contents we assess the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighted average of valuations based on market multiples  discounted cash flows  and consideration of our market capitalization 
the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuations are discount rates and perpetual growth rates applied to cash flow projections 
also inherent in the discounted cash flow valuation models are past performance  projections and assumptions in current operating plans  and revenue growth rates over the next five years 
these assumptions contemplate business  market and overall economic conditions 
we also consider assumptions that market participants may use 
as required by the company s policy  annual impairment assessments and testing of goodwill are performed during the fourth quarter of each year or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment might exist 
based on this testing  we determined that the estimated fair value of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values as of october   goodwill was not impaired  and no events have occurred since that date that would require an interim impairment test 
in the future  our estimated fair value could be negatively impacted by extended declines in our stock price  changes in macroeconomic indicators  sustained operating losses  and other factors which may affect our assessment of fair value 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method prescribed by us gaap 
we evaluate valuation allowances for deferred tax assets for which future realization is uncertain 
the estimation of required valuation allowance includes estimates of future taxable income 
in our assessment of our deferred tax assets at december   we considered that it was more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets would be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
the company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions asc  which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  on our consolidated tax return 
we evaluate and record any uncertain tax positions based on the amount that management deems is more likely than not to be sustained upon ultimate settlement with the tax authorities in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
insurance coverage  litigation  claims and contingencies we maintain insurance coverage for our business and operations 
insurance related to property  equipment  automobile  general liability and a portion of workers compensation is provided through traditional policies  subject to a deductible 
a portion of our workers compensation exposure is covered through a mutual association  which is subject to supplemental calls 
the company maintains two levels of excess loss insurance coverage  totaling million in excess of primary coverage  which excess loss coverage responds to most of the company s liability policies 
the company s excess loss coverage responds to most of its policies when a primary limit of million has been exhausted  provided that the primary limit for maritime employer s liability is million and the watercraft pollution policy primary limit is million 
we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles  limits and retentions under our insurance programs 
losses on these policies up to the deductible amounts are accrued in our consolidated financial statements based on known claims incurred and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
we derive our accruals from known facts  historical trends and industry averages to determine the best estimate of the ultimate expected loss 
actual claims may vary from our estimate 
we include any adjustments to such reserves in our consolidated results of operations in the period in which they become known 
accounting for stock issued to employees and others we measure the cost of equity compensation to our employees and independent directors based on the estimated grant date fair value of the award and recognize the expense over the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to compute the fair value of the awards of equity instruments 
the black scholes model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions in the computation 
changes in these assumptions can cause significant fluctuations in the fair value of the option award 
consolidated results of operations backlog information our contract backlog represents our estimate of the revenues we expect to realize under the portion of contracts remaining to be performed 
given the typical duration of our contracts  which is generally less than a year  our backlog at any point in time usually represents only a portion of the revenue that we expect to realize during a twelve month period 
many projects that make up our backlog may be canceled at any time without penalty  however  we can generally recover actual committed costs 
table of contents and profit on work performed up to the date of cancellation 
although we have not been materially adversely affected by contract cancellations or modifications in the past  we may be in the future  especially in economically uncertain periods 
consequently  backlog is not necessarily indicative of future results 
in addition to our backlog under contract  we also have a substantial number of projects in negotiation or pending award at any time 
backlog at december  was million  as compared with million at december   an increase of from the prior year period and reflects the success of our pricing strategies  as well as the continued improvement in the economy

revenues in increased approximately as compared with  and was substantially related to changes in the size  scope  composition and schedules of the mix of jobs in each period 
in the second half of  we commenced work on several large projects for private sector customers  which is reflected in the shift of revenue generated from the public sector to the private sector 
revenue generated from private customers was and in and  respectively 
contract revenue generated from public sector customers represented of total revenue the year  as compared with during we view these revenue shifts from one sector to another as normal in the marine construction business 
gross profit 
gross profit was million in the twelve month period ended december   an increase of million compared with  primarily related to better utilization of equipment  particularly in the second half of the year  as well as our decision to adjust bid margins to build volume 
gross margin in was as compared to in the prior year period  primarily related to the mix of jobs in progress between periods 
as measured by cost  our self performance rate was during  as compared with in the prior year period 
the reduction in our self performance rate indicates an increase in the percent of work that was subcontracted to third parties  and is reflective of the types of jobs in progress at any point in time 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million  a decrease of million  or  as compared with the prior year period  primarily related to cost containment measures put in place during  and decreases in our estimates related to self insurance expenses and property taxes 
income tax benefit expense

total revenue in decreased approximately million  or  as compared with as projects schedules progressed  we were not able to replace our backlog with new work as quickly due to postponement of capital infrastructure projects  particularly in the private sector  constraints in the government budgeting process to fund federal projects  resulting in a slowdown in letting of contracts  fewer contract awards received due to aggressive pricing pressure in the market 
the factors above resulted in gaps between project end dates and the remobilization of equipment to new projects 
in addition  we were unable to commence work as expected on two major projects due to permitting and other factors beyond our control these delays shifted revenue generated from these projects into later periods 
contract revenue generated from public agencies  including the us corps of engineers  represented of total revenues  as compared with in revenue generated from the private sector was and in and  respectively 
the shift in work toward the public sector is due in part to the dredging assets purchased in  which added to our capacity to bid on federal projects  as well as to the weak economy  which reduced capital expenditure spending by the private sector 
gross profit 
gross profit in was million  a decrease of million or from  and was primarily related to increased equipment costs  including an increase in depreciation as a result of the acquisitions completed in  and to maintenance and repairs  mainly on dredging assets 
gross profit was impacted additionally by underutilized equipment and to labor expense for crews idled when projects completed 
we increased our estimates for liabilities related to self insurance claims  particularly due to two non fatal job related accidents in the year 
gross margin was as compared with in the variance between periods was due to the factors described above  to pricing pressure on projects in progress  and to the mix and scope of contracts in the current year as compared with the same period last year

table of contents income tax benefit expense 
our effective rate for the year ended december  was 
this differed from the company s statutory rate of primarily due to state income taxes  net of the federal benefit and the non deductibility of certain permanent tax items  such as incentive stock compensation expense 
our effective tax rate at december  was 
liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs are to finance our working capital  fund capital expenditures  and pursue strategic acquisitions 
historically  our source of liquidity has been cash provided by our operating activities and borrowings under our credit facility as defined below 
our working capital position fluctuates from period to period due to normal increases and decreases in operational activity 
at december   our working capital was million  as compared with million at december  as of december   we had cash on hand of million 
availability under our revolving credit facility was subject to a borrowing base  which did not limit our borrowing availability of approximately million 
we expect to meet our future internal liquidity and working capital needs  and maintain our equipment fleet through capital expenditure purchases and major repairs  from funds generated in our operating activities for at least the next months 
we believe our cash position is adequate for our general business requirements discussed above and to service our debt 
the following table provides information regarding our cash flows and our capital expenditures for the years ending december  and year ended december  cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows used in investing activities cash flows provided by used in financing activities capital expenditures included in investing activities above operating activities 
during  our operations provided approximately million in net cash inflows  as compared with cash provided by operations in the prior year period of million 
the decrease in cash inflows from operations of million between periods was related to a decrease in our net loss of approximately million  an increase in trade accounts receivable balances  related to the timing of billings to customers  as compared with net collections of receivables in the prior year period  which resulted in a net outflow between periods of million  net outflow of cash of million between periods related to billings to and payments from customers for costs that cannot be billed  or receipt of payments for items such as mobilization at project commencement  receipt of million in cash in related to the carryback of current operating losses to prior year tax returns changes in other working capital components  including trade payables  which are related to the composition of projects in process  and which resulted in a net inflow of cash between and of million changes in non cash components of approximately million  primarily related to changes in our net deferred tax liability  resulting from an increase in our net operating loss carryforwards in the current year 
the increase in cash provided from operations between and was due to increases in working capital balances  particularly decreases in accounts receivable and net underbillings  reflecting the lower project activities in that period 
changes in working capital are normal within our business and are not necessarily indicative of any fundamental change within working capital components or trend in the underlying business 
investing activities 
capital asset additions and betterments to our fleet were million in  as compared with million in also in  we purchased approximately acres of land and buildings in tampa  florida  for a price of approximately million and purchased the assets of west construction for million 
in  we acquired the business of tw laquay dredging for approximately million  and we expanded into the pacific northwest through a business acquisition totaling million 

table of contents financing activities 
we funded the purchase of land and buildings in tampa  florida  as well as the purchase of west construction  from our credit facility through draws totaling million  of which million was converted to a term loan 
we repaid amounts drawn on the revolving portion of our credit facility  such that at december   million remained on the revolver 
in addition  scheduled installment payments on the term loan component totaled approximately  in the year 
in  we repurchased approximately  shares of stock into treasury for approximately million 
the share buyback program expired in may  no shares were repurchased in sources of capital in june  the company entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement with wells fargo bank  national association  as administrative agent  and wells fargo securities  llc as sole lead arranger and bookrunner  and other lenders  from time to time 
the credit agreement was amended in june in response to the company near term outlook  at which time wells fargo became the sole lender 
the amended credit agreement provides for borrowings under a revolving line of credit and swingline loans  an accordian  and a term loan together  the credit facility 
the credit facility is guaranteed by the subsidiaries of the company  secured by the assets of the company  including stock held in its subsidiaries  and may be used to finance working capital  repay indebtedness  fund acquisitions  and for other general corporate purposes 
interest is computed based on the designation of the loans  and bear interest at either a prime based interest rate or a libor based interest rate 
principal balances drawn under the credit facility may be prepaid at any time  in whole or in part  without premium or penalty 
amounts repaid under the revolving line of credit may be re borrowed 
all of the components of the credit facility mature on june  provisions of the revolving line of credit and accordian as part of the amendment  the company elected to reduce the maximum borrowing availability under the revolving line of credit and swingline loans as defined in the credit agreement from million to million  with a million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit 
an additional million is available subject to the lender discretion 
revolving loans may be designated as prime rate based loans abr loans or eurodollar loans  at the company s request  and may be made in an integral multiple of  in the case of an abr loan  or million in the case of a eurodollar loan 
swingline loans may only be designated as abr loans  and may be made in amounts equal to integral multiples of  the company may convert  change or modify such designations from time to time 
borrowings are subject to a borrowing base  which is calculated as the sum of of eligible accounts receivable  plus of adjusted cash balances  as defined in the credit agreement 
at december   our borrowing base reflected no limitation in borrowing availability 
during  the company drew on its credit facility to fund the purchase of the land in tampa  florida in january in the amount of million 
the borrowing of million was converted into a term loan in the amount of million  with the balance of million remaining under the revolver 
the company repaid the revolver portion in september 
in october  the company drew million under the revolver to fund the purchase of the assets of west construction  of which million was repaid in december 
at december   million was outstanding under the revolver  which  combined with our outstanding letters of credit  reduced our maximum borrowing availability to approximately million 
provisions of the term loan at december   the term loan component of the credit facility totaled million and is secured by specific dredge assets of the company 
principal payments on the term loan  in the amount of  commenced in september  and are due quarterly 
financial covenants restrictive financial covenants under the credit facility were modified in june to eliminate the fixed charge coverage ratio  eliminate the leverage ratio  change the net worth covenant to a tangible net worth covenant  with the minimum tangible net worth requirement of a base amount of million as of the effective date of the amendment  plus of consolidated quarterly net income if positive  plus of all issuances of equity interests by borrower during that quarter  and 
table of contents add a profitability covenant such that the company shall not sustain a consolidated net loss for two consecutive fiscal quarters  commencing with the quarter ending september  in addition  the credit facility contains events of default that are usual and customary for similar transactions  including non payment of principal  interest or fees  inaccuracy of representations and warranties  violation of covenants  bankruptcy and insolvency events  and events constituting a change of control 
the company is subject to a commitment fee  at a current rate of of the unused portion of the maximum available to borrow under the credit facility 
the commitment fee is payable quarterly in arrears 
interest at december   was based on a libor option interest rate of 
for the year ended december   the weighted average interest rate was 
at december   the company had letters of credit outstanding of approximately  at december   the company was in compliance with its financial covenants 
the company expects to meet its future internal liquidity and working capital needs  and maintain its equipment fleet through capital expenditure purchases and major repairs  from funds generated by ts operating activities for at least the next months 
we believe our cash position is adequate for our general business requirements and to service our debt 
bonding capacity we are generally required to provide various types of surety bonds that provide additional security to our customers for our performance under certain government and private sector contracts 
our ability to obtain surety bonds depends on our capitalization  working capital  past performance and external factors  including the capacity of the overall surety market 
at december   we believe our capacity under our current bonding arrangement was in excess of million  of which we had approximately million in surety bonds outstanding 
we believe our strong balance sheet and working capital position will allow us to continue to access our bonding capacity 
effect of inflation we are subject to the effects of inflation through increases in the cost of raw materials  and other items such as fuel 
because the typical duration of a project is between three to nine months we do not believe inflation has had a material impact on our operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we currently have no off balance sheet arrangements  other than operating leases to which we are a party  and which are discussed above under bonding capacity and sources of capital and which arise in the normal course of business 
these arrangements are not reasonably likely to have an effect on our financial condition  or results of operations that is material to investors 
see note commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this annual report on form k 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth information about our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payment due by period total year years years years in thousands long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total commitments pursuant to other purchase orders and subcontracts related to construction contracts are not included since such amounts are expected to be funded under contract billings 

table of contents to manage risks of changes in the material prices and subcontracting costs used in tendering bids for construction contracts  we obtain firm quotations from our suppliers and subcontractors before submitting a bid 
these quotations do not include any quantity guarantees  and we have no obligation for materials or subcontract services beyond those required to complete the contracts that we are awarded for which quotations have been provided 
recently issued accounting pronouncements accounting standards update asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts was issued in december the amendments in this asu modify step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
the qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance and examples  which require that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  the adoption of this accounting standard update did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations  cash flows or disclosures 
asu  business combinations topic disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations was issued in december asu provides clarification as to the presentation of pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for business combinations and expands supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  non recurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
the company will comply with the provisions of asu for any future business combinations 
asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment was issued in september this accounting standard update amends accounting guidance on goodwill impairment testing  and is intended to reduce complexity and costs by allowing an entity the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it should calculate the fair value of a reporting unit 
in addition  this amendment expands upon examples of events and circumstances that an entity should consider in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
this accounting standard update is effective for interim and annual goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
early adoption of this standard in september did not have an impact on the company financial position  results or operations or cash flows  as it is intended to simplify the assessment of goodwill impairment 
during the periods presented in these financial statements  the company implemented other new accounting pronouncements other than those noted above that are discussed in the notes where applicable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading  speculation or other purposes that would expose the company to market risk 
in the normal course of business  our results of operations are subject to risks related to fluctuation in commodity prices and fluctuations in interest rates 
commodity price risk we are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices for concrete  steel products and fuel 
although we attempt to secure firm quotes from our suppliers  we generally do not hedge against increases in prices for concrete  steel and fuel 
commodity price risks may have an impact on our results of operations due to the fixed price nature of many of our contracts  although the short term duration of our projects may allow us to include price increases in the costs of our bids 
interest rate risk at december   we had approximately million outstanding on our credit facility 
our objectives in managing interest rate risk are to lower our overall borrowing costs and limit interest rate changes on our earnings and cash flows 
to achieve this  we closely monitor changes in interest rates and we utilize cash from operations to reduce our debt position
