item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview 
we are a company that operates in one segment  heavy civil construction  through our subsidiaries  and which specializes in the building  reconstruction and repair of transportation and water infrastructure in texas  utah  nevada  arizona and california and other states where we see opportunities 
we have strategically expanded our operations  either by establishing an office in a new market  often after having successfully bid on and completed a project in that market  or by acquiring a company that gives us an immediate entry into a market 
on august   we expanded our operations into arizona and california with the acquisitions of jbc and myers 
critical accounting policies 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates the critical accounting policies used to prepare its consolidated financial statements  including  but not limited to  those related to revenue recognition contracts receivable  including retainage valuation of property and equipment  goodwill and other long lived assets construction joint ventures income taxes segment reporting our significant accounting policies are described in note  and conform to the fasb s accounting standards codification or gaap or asc 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
certain of the company s accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include the recognition of revenue and earnings from construction contracts under the percentage of completion method  the valuation of long lived assets  and income taxes 
management continually evaluates all of its estimates and judgments based on available information and experience  however  actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
contract revenue recognition the majority of our contracts with our customers are fixed unit price 
under such contracts  we are committed to providing materials or services required by a contract at fixed unit prices for example  dollars per cubic yard of concrete poured or per cubic yard of earth excavated 
most of our state and municipal contracts provide for termination of the contract for the convenience of the owner  with provisions to pay us only for work performed through the date of termination 
credit risk is minimal with public owners since the company ascertains that funds have been appropriated by the governmental project owner prior to commencing work on such projects 
while most public contracts are subject to termination at the election of the government entity  in the event of termination the company is entitled to receive the contract price for completed work and reimbursement of termination related costs 
credit risk with private owners is minimized because of statutory mechanics liens  which give the company high priority in the event of lien foreclosures following financial difficulties of private owners 
we use the percentage of completion accounting method for construction contracts 
revenue is recognized as costs are incurred in an amount equal to cost plus the related expected profit based on the percentage of completion method of accounting in the ratio of costs incurred to estimated final costs 
our contracts generally take to months to complete 
contract costs consist of direct costs on contracts  including labor  materials  amounts payable to subcontractors and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect salaries and wages  equipment maintenance  repairs  fuel and depreciation  insurance and payroll taxes 
contract cost is recorded as incurred  and revisions in contract revenue and cost estimates are reflected in the accounting period when known 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability  including those changes arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
an amount attributable to contract claims is included in revenues when realization is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the company generally provides a one to two year warranty for workmanship under its contracts 
warranty claims historically have been insignificant 
the accuracy of our revenue and profit recognition in a given period is dependent on the accuracy of our estimates of the revenues and costs to finish uncompleted contracts 
our estimates for all of our significant contracts use a highly detailed bottom up approach  and we believe our experience allows us to produce reliable estimates 
however  our projects can be highly complex  and in almost every case  the profit margin estimates for a contract will either increase or decrease to some extent from the amount that was originally estimated at the time of bid 
because we have a large number of projects of varying levels of size and complexity in process at any given time  these changes in estimates can sometimes offset each other without materially impacting our overall profitability 
however  large changes in revenue or cost estimates can have a significant effect on profitability 
there are a number of factors that can contribute to changes in estimates of contract cost and profitability 
the most significant of these include the completeness and accuracy of the original bid  recognition of costs associated with scope changes  extended overhead due to customer related and weather related delays  subcontractor and supplier performance issues  site conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid to the extent contract remedies are unavailable  the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project and changes in the availability and proximity of materials 
the foregoing factors  as well as the stage of completion of contracts in process and the mix of contracts at different margins  may cause fluctuations in gross profit between periods  and these fluctuations may be significant 
results for and were adversely affected by revisions to estimated profitability on a number of construction projects 
see recent developments financial results for  operational issues and outlook for financial results above and results of operations fiscal year ended december  compared with fiscal year ended december  for further discussion of the impact on our financial results 
contracts receivable  including retainage contracts receivable are generally based on amounts billed to the customer 
at december  and  contracts receivable included million and million of retainage  respectively  which is being withheld by customers until completion of the contracts 
all other contracts receivable include only balances approved for payment by the customer 
many of the contracts under which the company performs work contain retainage provisions 
retainage refers to that portion of billings made by the company but held for payment by the customer pending satisfactory completion of the project 
retainage on active contracts is classified as a current asset regardless of the term of the contract and is generally collected within one year of the completion of a contract 
based upon a review of outstanding contracts receivable  historical collection information and existing economic conditions  management has determined that all contracts receivable at december   including retainage  are fully collectible  and  accordingly  no allowance for doubtful accounts against contracts receivable was necessary 
contracts receivable are written off based on individual credit evaluation and specific circumstances of the customer  when such treatment is warranted 
valuation of long lived assets 
long lived assets  which include property  equipment and acquired intangible assets  including goodwill  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment evaluations involve fair values and management estimates of useful asset lives and future cash flows 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by management  and this could have a material effect on operating results and financial position 
goodwill must be reviewed for impairment at least annually  and we completed our most recent annual impairment review for historical goodwill during the fourth quarter of it indicated that there was no impairment in goodwill 
note to the consolidated financial statements discusses the three valuation approaches used by the company to determine the fair value of the company s equity for purposes of evaluating whether there is an indication of goodwill impairment 
these valuation approaches are impacted by a number of factors but the key ones are the company s stock price  the company s financial performance relative to its peer group  the financial performance of the peer group  the estimated control premium and the estimated forecasted cash flows 
the valuation approaches contain uncertainty regarding the estimates used 
one of the largest uncertainties relates to government and state spending which management expects to increase in the next few years 
there are a number of other uncertainties with respect to our future financial performance that could impact estimated future cash flows 
these are discussed in a number of places including item ia 
risk factors 
we determined that the fair value of the company s equity was approximately above the carrying value of the company s equity  and therefore a modest change in estimated forecasted cash flows could result in an impairment of goodwill 
in  we determined that there was an impairment in goodwill of million  which has been recognized as a charge in at december   we had goodwill with a remaining carrying amount of approximately million 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and  where necessary  establish a valuation allowance 
we are subject to the alternative minimum tax  or amt  and payments of amt result in a reduction of our deferred tax liability 
segment reporting 
we operate in one segment and have only one reportable segment and one reporting unit component  heavy civil construction 
in making this determination  we considered that each project has similar characteristics  includes similar services and similar types of customers and is subject to similar regulatory and economic environments 
we organize  evaluate  and manage our financial information around each project when making operating decisions and assessing overall performance 
even if our local offices were to be considered separate components of our heavy civil construction operating segment  those components could be aggregated into a single reporting unit for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment under asc and eitf d because our local offices all have similar economic characteristics and are similar in all of the following areas the nature of the products and services each of our local offices perform similar construction projects they build  reconstruct and repair roads  highways  bridges  light rail and water  waste water and storm drainage systems 
the nature of the production processes our heavy civil construction services rendered in the construction process for each of our construction projects performed by each local office is the same they excavate dirt  remove existing pavement and pipe  lay aggregate or concrete pavement  pipe and rail and build bridges and similar large structures in order to complete our projects 
the type or class of customer for products and services substantially all of our customers are state departments of transportation  cities  counties  and regional water  rail and toll road authorities 
a substantial portion of the funding for the state departments of transportation to finance the projects we construct is furnished by the federal government 
the methods used to distribute products or provide services the heavy civil construction services rendered on our projects are performed primarily with our own field work crews laborers  equipment operators and supervisors and equipment backhoes  loaders  dozers  graders  cranes  pug mills  crushers  and concrete and asphalt plants 
the nature of the regulatory environment we perform substantially all of our projects for federal  state and municipal governmental agencies  and all of the projects that we perform are subject to substantially similar regulation under us and state department of transportation rules  including prevailing wage and hour laws  codes established by the federal government and municipalities regarding water and waste water systems installation  and laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health of the us occupational safety and health administration and to the employment of immigrants of the us department of homeland security 
the economic characteristics of our local offices are similar 
while profit margin objectives included in contract bids have some variability from contract to contract  our profit margin objectives are not differentiated by our chief operating decision maker or our office management based on local office location 
instead  the projects undertaken by each local office are primarily competitively bid  fixed unit or negotiated lump sum price contracts  all of which are bid based on achieving gross margin objectives that reflect the relevant skills required  the contract size and duration  the availability of our personnel and equipment  the makeup and level of our existing backlog  our competitive advantages and disadvantages  prior experience  the contracting agency or customer  the source of contract funding  anticipated start and completion dates  construction risks  penalties or incentives and general economic conditions 
results of operations 
backlog at december  at december   our backlog of construction projects was million  as compared to million at december  our company was awarded million of new contracts in  excluding acquired contracts  compared to million of new contracts in our contracts are typically completed in to months 
at december   there was approximately million excluded from our consolidated backlog where we were the apparent low bidder  but had not yet been formally awarded the contract or the contract price had not been finalized 
backlog includes million attributable to our share of estimated revenues related to joint ventures where we are a noncontrolling joint venture partner 
as discussed further in item business recent developments financial results for  operational issues and outlook for financial results  based on our current estimates  the gross margin in our backlog is lower than the gross margin of realized in as a result of operational issues and lower infrastructure capital expenditures by federal and state governments 
we do  however  expect that our markets will ultimately recover from the conditions discussed in item business and that our backlog and revenues will grow and gross margins  net income and earnings per share will return to levels more consistent with historical rates of return 
however  we cannot predict the timing of such a return to historical normalcy in our markets 
we believe that the company is in sound financial condition and has the resources and management experience to weather current market conditions and to continue to compete successfully for projects as they become available at acceptable profit margin levels

revenues 
revenues for increased compared with the prior year 
most of this increase is attributable to revenues from contracts performed in arizona and california which totaled million in as compared to million in prior to the august  acquisitions of jbc and myers  we did not perform any work in these states 
since our acquisition of these entities they have performed well in their respective markets 
we also had higher revenues in utah  nevada  and texas reflecting higher activity levels and improvements in estimated profitability in certain projects 
during  results included million of revenues and million of gross profit attributable to our share of the results from a construction project joint venture in which we were a minority participant 
the joint venture s construction project is substantially complete  and we do not anticipate a significant amount of additional earnings from this joint venture in future periods 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million for compared with the prior year 
gross margins declined to in from in due to net downward revisions of estimated revenues and gross margins on a number of construction projects  primarily in texas 
upward revisions on projects in utah substantially offset the downward revisions for texas projects in downward revisions for texas projects had a significant impact on gross profits as well 
these upward revisions were primarily related to the joint venture project which is substantially complete discussed under revenues above 
the net revisions to contract estimates were the result of different factors affecting various contracts  some positively and some negatively 
while there are a number of factors which cause the costs incurred and gross profit realized on our contracts to vary  sometimes substantially  from our original projections  the primary factors which resulted in downward revisions in estimates in were conditions or contract requirements that differed from those assumed in the original bid or contract  lower than expected activity levels  and delays in quickly identifying and taking measures to address issues which arose during production 
at december   we had approximately contracts in progress which were less than complete of various sizes  of different expected profitability and in various stages of completion 
the nearer a contract progresses toward completion  the more visibility we have in refining our estimate of total revenues including incentives  delay penalties and change orders  costs and gross profit 
thus gross profit as a percent of revenues can increase or decrease from comparable and sequential quarters due to variations among contracts and depending upon the stage of completion of contracts 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for included a full year of general and administrative expenses for jbc and myers which we acquired on august  as well as an increase in compensation related expenses and professional fees 
as a percent of revenues  general and administrative expenses in were higher at compared with for the prior year and included a signing bonus of  paid to our newly appointed ceo and  in compensation for our retiring ceo 
goodwill impairment 
during the fourth quarter of  the company completed an evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill resulting in an impairment charge of million 
this charge had an impact of million on the net loss attributable to sterling common stockholders net of the related tax benefits and reduced for the amount attributable to noncontrolling interest owners or per diluted share 
no goodwill impairment charge was recorded in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rates for and were and  respectively  and varied from the statutory rate primarily as a result of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest owners which are taxed to those owners rather than sterling 
in addition  the effective tax rate for was impacted by non taxable interest income  and the effective tax rate for was impacted by the portion of the goodwill impairment attributable to goodwill that is not deductible for tax purposes 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interest owners increased in compared with and is primarily related to net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest owners in rlw 
this subsidiary was owned until december  when we acquired the remaining interest 
as discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements  the members of rlw  including the company  agreed to amend rlw s operating agreement effective january  to provide that any goodwill impairment  including the fourth quarter goodwill impairment  is not to be allocated to rlw for the purpose of calculating the distributions to be made to the rlw noncontrolling interest holders 
this amendment resulted in an increase in the net income attributable to rlw s noncontrolling interests of million during this increase is included in noncontrolling owners interests in earnings of subsidiaries and joint ventures in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations with an increase in the current obligation for noncontrolling owners interest in subsidiaries and joint ventures in the consolidated balance sheet 
this increase has a related tax impact of million which increased the tax benefit for fiscal year ended december  compared with fiscal year ended december  change dollar amounts in thousands revenues gross profit general and administrative expenses goodwill impairment nm unusual items nm other income expense nm operating income loss nm gains losses on the sale of short term investments nm interest income interest expense income loss before income taxes and earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests nm income tax benefit expense nm net income loss nm noncontrolling owners interests in earnings of subsidiaries and joint ventures net income loss attributable to sterling common stockholders nm gross margin operating margin deficit nm contract backlog  end of year nm not meaningful revenues 
revenues increased or million in fiscal year over fiscal year the increase was primarily due to increased production levels in as a result of execution on contracts awarded in texas markets in  increased revenues resulting from a higher level of activity on joint ventures in which we participate  primarily in utah  and million in revenues in arizona and california attributable to jbc and myers which were acquired on august  revenues for our nevada operations declined from the prior year due to fewer construction contracts  and in texas the increase in revenues between the periods was less than expected due to severe adverse weather conditions during the first quarter of and delays by a customer in starting two sizable contracts 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased million for compared with the prior year and gross margins decreased to from in due to net downward revisions of estimated revenues and gross margins on a number of construction projects  primarily in texas 
the primary factors which caused the net charge in were onsite conditions that differed from those assumed in the original bid or contract  delays caused by weather conditions  contract or project modifications creating unanticipated costs not covered by change orders  failure by our suppliers  subcontractors or customers to perform their obligations  shortages in the availability of skilled workers in the geographic location of certain projects  especially due to the rapid expansion of our business in certain markets  delays in obtaining required governmental permits or approvals causing cost overruns on certain projects  including two large construction projects in dallas where the construction start date was delayed significantly by the owner  and delays in quickly identifying and taking measures to address issues which arose during production 
at december   we had approximately contracts in progress which were less than complete of various sizes  of different expected profitability and various stage of completion 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for included  related to litigation and acquisition related costs which are shown separately in the table above 
in addition  included the general and administrative expenses of the two companies we acquired on august  as well as an increase in salaries  wages and related benefits primarily resulting from added positions 
offsetting these increases was a decrease in bonus compensation resulting from lower earnings for the period 
as a percent of revenues  general and administrative expenses were in compared with in income taxes 
the company s effective income tax rates for and were and  respectively  and varied from the statutory rate primarily as a result of net income attributable to noncontrolling interest owners which are taxed to those owners rather than sterling 
in addition  the effective tax rate for was impacted by the portion of the goodwill impairment attributable to goodwill that is not deductible for tax purposes 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 
the net income attributable to noncontrolling interest owners decreased in compared with as a result of the million impact for the impairment of goodwill attributable to noncontrolling interest owners 
offsetting this impact was an increase in earnings from a owned consolidated joint venture controlled by rlw as well as income attributable to the noncontrolling interest owners of myers which was acquired in august historical cash flows 
the following table sets forth information about our cash flows and liquidity in thousands years ended december  net cash provided by used in operating activities capital expenditures proceeds from sale of property and equipment acquisition of noncontrolling interest net assets of acquired companies net sales purchases of short term securities distributions to noncontrolling interest owners purchases of treasury stock net drawdowns repayment on the credit facility other total as of december  cash and cash equivalents working capital operating activities 
significant non cash items included in operating activities are the impairment of goodwill of million in  depreciation and amortization which increased to million in as compared to million in and million in as a result of an increase in capital expenditures as well as depreciation associated with jbc and myers which were acquired in  deferred tax benefit expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively  the deferred tax benefit for is primarily the result of recording the impairment of goodwill for financial reporting purposes whereas goodwill is amortized for tax return purposes  the deferred tax expense in is the result of recognizing accelerated depreciation methods used on equipment for tax purposes as compared to straight line depreciation used for financial reporting purposes and amortizing goodwill for tax return purposes but not for financial reporting purposes 
besides the net income loss in  and and the non cash items discussed above  other significant components of cash flows from operations which excludes the impact of changes attributable to the net assets of acquired companies was a decrease in cash and cash equivalents related to non cash working capital of million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
investing activities 
capital equipment is acquired as needed to support increased levels of production activities and to replace retiring equipment 
expenditures for the replacement of certain equipment and to expand our construction fleet totaled million in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment totaled million for with an associated net gain of million 
for the years ended december  and  capital expenditures totaled million and million  respectively  while proceeds from the sale of property and equipment totaled million and million  respectively  with an associated net gain loss of million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures for are higher than to support our higher level of operations and to replace equipment 
in addition  proceeds from sales of property and equipment in have been higher than in previous periods as management undertook a program to dispose of underutilized and aging equipment 
the lower expenditures in reflect the smaller size of our operations as well as efforts to minimize expenditures in response to the poor economic conditions 
during  and  the company had net purchases sales of short term securities of million  million and million  respectively 
the net purchases in and were primarily due to the investment of cash generated by operations  after repayment of indebtedness 
on august   the company used million of existing cash and short term investments to fund the acquisition of jbc  a heavy civil construction business operating in arizona 
additional purchase consideration of up to million may be paid in connection with this acquisition subject to the achievement of certain earnings requirements during the period from through july  also on august   the company acquired a interest in myers  a construction limited partnership located in california 
the company paid a purchase price of million which was funded by available cash of the company 
in december  the company acquired the remaining interest in rhb from the noncontrolling interest owner for million as a result of the owner s exercise of his right to put the interest 
on december   the company acquired the remaining unowned interest in rlw for million 
the purchase price was subject to further adjustment once earnings for were finalized and as result an additional  shall be paid in financing activities 
financing activities in consisted of drawdowns and repayments on the credit facility with a net drawdown of million  primarily to fund the purchase of the interest in rlw on december  discussed above and distributions to noncontrolling interest owners of million 
financing activities in primarily reflect distributions to noncontrolling interest owners of million and purchases of treasury stock of million 
financing activities in primarily reflect a reduction of million in borrowings under our credit facility and distributions to noncontrolling interest owners of million 
the amount of borrowings under the credit facility is based on the company s expectations of working capital requirements 
liquidity and sources of capital the need for working capital for our business varies due to fluctuations in customer receivables and contract retentions  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings  the size and status of contract mobilization payments and progress billings  and the amounts owed to suppliers and subcontractors 
some of these fluctuations can be significant 
as of december   we had working capital of million  a decrease of million over december  the decrease in working capital was the result of the following in thousands net income current portion of obligation to noncontrolling interest owners of rlw depreciation and amortization capital expenditures acquisition of noncontrolling interests proceeds from sales of property and equipment  net of gain loss distributions to noncontrolling interest owners net drawdowns on the credit facility other total decrease in working capital in addition to our available cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and cash provided by operations  from time to time  we use borrowings under our million credit facility with comerica bank to finance our capital expenditures and working capital needs 
the credit facility has a maturity date of september  subject to the conditions under the terms of the credit facility  including the financial covenants discussed below  up to million in borrowings and letters of credit is available under the amended credit facility with  under certain circumstances  an optional increase of million 
borrowings under the credit facility are secured by all assets of the company  other than proceeds and other rights under our construction contracts which are pledged to our bond surety 
at december   there were borrowings of million outstanding under the credit facility and a letter of credit of million outstanding which reduced availability under the credit facility to million 
in january  the company sold approximately million of its short term investments in order to repay the million of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december  average borrowings under the credit facility for the fiscal year were million and the largest amount of borrowings under the credit facility was million on december  average borrowings under the credit facility for the fiscal year were  and the largest amount of borrowings under the credit facility was million on september  the credit facility is subject to our compliance with certain covenants  including financial covenants at year end relating to leverage  tangible net worth  and asset coverage 
the credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to make distributions or pay dividends  incur liens and encumbrances  incur further indebtedness  guarantee obligations  dispose of a material portion of assets or merge with a third party  and make investments in securities 
to date the company has not experienced any difficulty in borrowing under the credit facility  and the company was in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility as of december  management believes that the company has sufficient liquid financial resources  including the unused portion of its credit facility  to fund its requirements for the next twelve months of operations  including its bonding requirements  and the company expects no material adverse change in its liquidity 
future developments or events  such as an increase in our level of purchases of equipment to support significantly higher backlog or an acquisition of another company could  however  affect our level of working capital and tangible net worth 
contractual obligations 
the following table sets forth our fixed  non cancelable obligations at december  payments due by period total year years years years amounts in thousands credit facility operating leases mortgage earn out liability to former owner of jbc rlw put call liabilities our obligations for interest are not included in the table above as these amounts vary according to the levels of debt outstanding at any time 
interest on our credit facility is paid monthly and fluctuates with the balances outstanding during the year  as well as with fluctuations in interest rates 
in  interest on the credit facility was approximately  to manage risks of changes in the material prices and subcontracting costs used in submitting bids for construction contracts  we generally obtain firm quotations from our suppliers and subcontractors before submitting a bid 
these quotations do not include any quantity guarantees  and we have no obligation for materials or subcontract services beyond those required to complete the contracts that we are awarded for which quotations have been provided 
as is customary in the construction business  we are required to provide surety bonds to secure our performance under construction contracts 
our ability to obtain surety bonds primarily depends upon our capitalization  working capital  past performance  management expertise and reputation and certain external factors  including the overall capacity of the surety market 
surety companies consider such factors in relationship to the amount of our backlog and their underwriting standards  which may change from time to time 
we have pledged all proceeds and other rights under our construction contracts to our bond surety company 
events that affect the insurance and bonding markets may result in bonding becoming more difficult to obtain in the future  or being available only at a significantly greater cost 
to date  we have not encountered difficulties or material cost increases in obtaining new surety bonds 
capital expenditures 
capital equipment is acquired as needed by increased levels of production and to replace retiring equipment 
management expects capital expenditures in to be lower than the million incurred in  however  the award of a project requiring significant purchases of equipment or other factors could result in increased expenditures 
inflation 
inflation generally has not had a material impact on our financial results  however  from time to time increases in oil  fuel  and steel prices have affected our cost of operations 
anticipated cost increases and reductions are considered in our bids to customers on proposed new construction projects 
in order to mitigate our exposure to increases in fuel prices  we have a program to hedge our exposure to increases in diesel fuel prices by entering into swap contracts for diesel fuel 
we believe that the gains and losses on these contracts will tend to offset increases and decreases in the price we pay for diesel fuel and reduce the volatility of such fuel costs in our operations 
as of december   we had diesel futures contracts for  gallons which fixed prices at an average of per gallon 
this compares to the december  price for off road ultra low sulfur diesel published by platts of 
we will continue to evaluate this strategy and may increase or decrease our commitments depending on our forecast of the diesel fuel market and other operational considerations 
there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful 
where we are the successful bidder on a project  we execute purchase orders with material suppliers and contracts with subcontractors covering the prices of most materials and services  other than oil and fuel products  thereby mitigating future price increases and supply disruptions 
these purchase orders and contracts do not contain quantity guarantees  and we have no obligation for materials and services beyond those required to complete the contracts with our customers 
there can be no assurance that increases in prices of oil and fuel used in our business will be adequately covered by the estimated escalation we have included in our bids or derivative contracts entered into to hedge against such increases  and there can be no assurance that all of our vendors will fulfill their pricing and supply commitments under their purchase orders and contracts with the company 
we adjust our total estimated costs on our projects when we believe it is probable that we will have cost increases which will not be recovered from customers  vendors or re engineering 
off balance sheet arrangements and joint ventures 
we participate in various construction joint venture partnerships in order to share expertise  risk and resources for certain highly complex projects 
the venture s contract with the project owner typically requires joint and several liability among the joint venture partners 
although our agreements with our joint venture partners provide that each party will assume and fund its share of any losses resulting from a project  if one of our partners was unable to pay its share  we would be fully liable for such share under our contract with the project owner 
circumstances that could lead to a loss under these guarantee arrangements include a partner s inability to contribute additional funds to the venture in the event that the project incurred a loss or additional costs that we could incur should the partner fail to provide the services and resources toward project completion that had been committed to in the joint venture agreement 
at december   there was approximately million of construction work to be completed on unconsolidated construction joint venture contracts  of which million represented our proportionate share 
due to the joint and several liability under our joint venture arrangements  if one of our joint venture partners fails to perform  we and the remaining joint venture partners would be responsible for completion of the outstanding work 
as of december   we are not aware of any situation that would require us to fulfill responsibilities of our joint venture partners pursuant to the joint and several liability under our contracts 
off balance sheet arrangements related to the operating leases are included in the table in contractual obligations above

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk changes in interest rates are one of our sources of market risks 
outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility bears interest at floating rates 
the average borrowings under this facility during were million 
based on our expected levels of borrowings for  we do not expect that a change in our interest rate would have a material impact on our results from operations 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in commodity prices 
in the normal course of business  we enter into derivative transactions  specifically cash flow hedges  to mitigate our exposure to diesel fuel commodity price movements 
we do not participate in these transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
while the use of these arrangements may limit the benefit to us of decreases in the prices of diesel fuel  it also limits the risk of adverse price movements
