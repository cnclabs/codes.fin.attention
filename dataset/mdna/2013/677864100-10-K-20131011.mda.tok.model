item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause a difference include those discussed under forward looking statements and in item a risk factors in this annual report on form k 
overview we develop  mine  manufacture and market sorbent products principally produced from clay minerals  primarily consisting of montmorillonite and attapulgite and  to a lesser extent  other clay like sorbent materials  such as antelope shale 
our principal products include agricultural and horticultural chemical carriers  animal health and nutrition products  cat litter  fluids purification and filtration bleaching clays  industrial and automotive floor absorbents and sports field products 
our products are sold to two primary customer groups  including customers who resell our products as originally produced to the end consumer and those who use our products as part of their production process or use them as an ingredient in their final finished product 
we have two reportable operating segments based on the different characteristics of our two primary customer groups retail and wholesale products group and business to business products group 
each operating segment is discussed individually below 
additional detailed descriptions of the operating segments are included in item business above 
consolidated net income was  or per diluted share  for the year ended july   a increase from net income of  or per diluted share  for the year ended july  during fiscal we experienced strong sales growth in global markets for our business to business products group 
also contributing to fiscal results were reduced trade spending and lower advertising in our retail and wholesale products group  following substantial promotional spending in fiscal for new cat pride fresh light products 
in fiscal  we completed the production relocation of certain products between our manufacturing facilities  which started at the end of fiscal  with minimal additional transition costs 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the production relocation charge 
in addition  our fiscal results reflected the benefit from the utilization of a portion of our domestic amt attributes  which resulted in a significantly lower effective tax rate for fiscal  as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal we experienced certain cost increases to produce and transport our products 
we expect transportation cost increases to continue due to recent trends and regulations in the freight industry and our concerted efforts to enhance customer services 
in addition  advertising and promotions spending in fiscal is expected to be greater than in fiscal we maintained a strong balance sheet in fiscal cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased during the year even as we invested in our capital assets  paid higher dividends and repaid debt 
we estimate cash requirements for capital expenditures in fiscal to be higher than in fiscal due to projects at our manufacturing facilities 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales for the year ended july  were  a increase from net sales of  in fiscal net sales improved due primarily to increased sales in our business to business products group  lower trade spending in our retail and wholesale products group trade spending is deducted from net sales and includes coupons  slotting and cooperative marketing programs  higher selling prices  and a favorable product sales mix  defined as a greater proportion of sales from higher priced products 
our business to business products group also benefited from more tons sold 
consolidated net income for fiscal was  a increase from net income of  in fiscal net income was positively impacted by a lower effective tax rate  higher net sales and lower advertising and promotion costs 
these positive factors more than offset increased costs for our incentive bonus  freight and materials 
segment operating income was higher for both our business to business and retail and wholesale products groups as discussed below 
business to business products group net sales of the business to business products group for fiscal were  an increase of  or  from net sales of  in fiscal net sales of fluid purification products  animal health products and co packaged cat litter all increased  while net sales of agricultural and horticultural products decreased 
net sales of fluid purification products were approximately greater than in fiscal with an increase in tons sold 
sales to edible oil  biodiesel and petroleum oil processors improved in both foreign and domestic markets 
sales to new customers and higher sales to existing customers were driven by global growth in edible oil production 
net sales of animal health and nutrition products increased approximately due primarily to a favorable product sales mix and more tons sold 
sales of our enterosorbent animal health products increased in both foreign and domestic markets  including both new customers and increased sales to existing customers 
our co packaged traditional coarse cat litter net sales increase of approximately was attributed primarily to more tons sold and higher selling prices 
a sales decline of approximately for our agricultural and horticultural products was caused primarily by fewer tons sold 
sales decreased for products used in horticultural applications and for our engineered granule product used in the professional pesticides and agricultural markets 
the business to business products group s operating income was  in fiscal  an increase of  or  from operating income of  in fiscal the benefit from improved sales described above was partially offset by higher freight and material costs per ton 
freight cost increases of approximately per ton were driven primarily by more shipments to foreign countries  higher diesel fuel prices and other cost increases in the freight industry  which are expected to continue due to recent trends and regulations 
material costs increased approximately per ton 
certain products in the business to business group received greater fixed manufacturing cost allocations subsequent to the production relocation for certain products between our plants  as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
see further discussion of manufacturing costs under consolidated results below 
the business to business products group s selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased approximately compared to fiscal due primarily to costs incurred to expand sales of our animal health and nutrition products in foreign markets 
retail and wholesale products group net sales of the retail and wholesale products group for fiscal were  an increase of  or  from net sales of  in fiscal net sales increased for cat litter products and for our foreign subsidiaries  but decreased for industrial absorbent products 
our foreign subsidiaries net sales are described under foreign operations below 
overall cat litter net sales increased approximately as the result of lower trade spending and higher selling prices  which outweighed a decline in tons sold 
our branded cat litter net sales increase of approximately was attributed primarily to approximately higher sales of our cat pride fresh light scoopable products and reduced trade spending 
these increases were partially offset by lower sales for our other cat pride scoopable and coarse litter products 
private label cat litter sales were down approximately due primarily to the continued decline in the coarse cat litter market  as well as a market trend away from private label cat litter products 
industrial absorbents net sales were down approximately with a decline in tons sold 
the retail and wholesale products group s segment operating income for fiscal was  an increase of  from operating income of  in fiscal the group operating income was positively impacted by the higher sales described above  by lower selling  general and administrative expenses  as discussed below  and by an approximate decrease in packaging costs per ton 
the group operating income was negatively impacted by approximately higher freight costs per ton due to more shipments to customers in regions with higher freight costs  higher diesel fuel prices and other cost increases in the freight industry which we expect to continue due to recent trends and regulations 
in addition  material costs per ton increased approximately primarily as the result of more purchased additives  fragrances and other materials required for the production of scoopable cat litters 
see further discussion of manufacturing costs under consolidated results below 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the retail and wholesale products group decreased approximately compared to fiscal we incurred substantial spending to advertise and promote our new cat pride fresh and light cat litter products in fiscal advertising and promotions spending in fiscal is expected to be greater than in fiscal consolidated results consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscal increased to from in fiscal gross profit improved because of the higher sales described above  a greater proportion of sales from higher margin products and lower costs for packaging 
partially offsetting these positive impacts were higher freight and material costs per ton  as described in the operating segment discussions above 
material costs were also effected by a increase in the fuel cost per ton produced  primarily for natural gas used to operate kilns that dry our clay 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the discussions of each segment operating income above describes the changes in selling  general and administrative expenses that were allocated to the operating segments  including approximately  lower advertising costs in the retail and wholesale products group 
the remaining unallocated corporate expenses in fiscal included a higher estimated annual incentive plan bonus accrual 
the incentive bonus expense was based on performance targets that are established for each fiscal year 
expenses also increased for the pension plan and for research and development  but decreased for the supplemental employee retirement plan serp 
see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the pension plan and the serp  respectively 
our effective tax rate was of pre tax income in fiscal compared to in fiscal during fiscal  we utilized approximately  of our domestic amt attributes 
we correspondingly reduced the domestic amt valuation allowance that had been established in prior years  which resulted in a lower federal income tax rate 
we expect our tax rate to return to historic levels in fiscal see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our income taxes 
foreign operations net sales by our foreign subsidiaries during fiscal were  an increase of  or  from net sales of  during fiscal net sales by our foreign subsidiaries represented of our consolidated net sales during fiscal year net sales increased for our united kingdom subsidiary and for our canadian subsidiary 
bleaching earth sales by our united kingdom subsidiary increased primarily due to a new customer 
branded cat litter sales by our canadian subsidiary increased  while industrial product sales were relatively flat 
for fiscal  our foreign subsidiaries reported a net loss of  compared to a net loss of  in fiscal the decrease in the net loss was primarily the result of higher sales and a reduction in overhead costs at our canadian subsidiary 
identifiable assets of our foreign subsidiaries as of july  were  compared to  as of july  the decrease is primarily due to lower cash  inventories and net fixed assets  which were partially offset by higher accounts receivable 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales for the year ended july  were  a increase from net sales of  in fiscal net sales increased for both our business to business products group and our retail and wholesale products group due primarily to increased net selling prices and a favorable product sales mix 
our business to business products group also benefited from more tons sold 
consolidated net income for fiscal was  a decrease from net income of  in fiscal the decline in net income was driven primarily by increased advertising expenditures in the retail and wholesale products group and a one time charge to relocate our industrial floor absorbent and cat litter products from our facility located in mounds  illinois to our plants located in mississippi 
in addition  during fiscal we experienced higher freight  packaging and material costs for both operating segments and higher non fuel manufacturing costs  which outweighed the benefit of lower cost for fuel used in our manufacturing processes 
segment operating income increased for the the business to business products group and decreased for the retail and wholesale products group as discussed below 
business to business products group net sales of the business to business products group for fiscal were  an increase of  or  from net sales of  in fiscal the increase in net sales was attributed to more tons sold  a favorable product sales mix and higher net selling prices 
net sales of agricultural and horticultural products  fluid purification products and animal health products all increased  while net sales of co packaged cat litter decreased 
net sales of agricultural and horticultural products increased approximately due primarily to more tons sold  a favorable product sales mix and higher net selling prices 
sales increased to agricultural chemical carrier formulators 
sales also increased to customers for our engineered granule product in the professional pesticides and agricultural markets 
net sales of fluid purification products increased approximately from fiscal with a increase in tons sold 
sales in domestic and some export markets improved due to new customers and increased sales to existing customers 
net sales of animal health and nutrition products increased approximately  driven primarily by a favorable product sales mix and more tons sold 
higher sales of our newer enterosorbent animal health products in foreign markets resulted from improved distribution and new product registration in certain countries 
the increased sales of our newer enterosorbent products considerably outweighed a decline in sales of our longer established animal health products 
our co packaged traditional coarse cat litter net sales decreased approximately due to the continued decline in the coarse cat litter segment of the market 
the business to business products group operating income was  in fiscal  an increase of  or  from operating income of  in fiscal this increase was driven by the higher net selling prices and favorable product sales mix described above  which was partially offset by higher freight and materials costs per ton 
freight costs per ton increased approximately driven primarily by higher diesel fuel prices and other cost increases in the freight industry 
material costs per ton increased approximately due primarily to higher non fuel manufacturing costs  which exceeded a reduction in the cost of fuel used in our manufacturing processes 
see further discussion of manufacturing costs under consolidated results below 
the business to business products group selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were even with fiscal retail and wholesale products group net sales of the retail and wholesale products group for fiscal were  an increase of  or  from net sales of  in fiscal the increase in net sales was attributed to a favorable product sales mix and higher net selling prices  which more than offset a decline in tons sold 
net sales increased for our cat litter products  but decreased for our foreign subsidiaries  as described under foreign operations below 
net sales for our industrial absorbent products were even with the prior year 
cat litter net sales increased approximately due primarily to a favorable product sales mix and higher net selling prices  which outweighed a decrease in tons sold 
branded cat litter net sales increased approximately with more tons sold 
branded cat litter sales improved primarily as the result of our cat pride fresh light scoopable products  which were introduced in the fourth quarter of fiscal  combined with higher sales of our established cat pride scoopable products 
the increase in branded cat litter net sales was partially offset by approximately lower sales of private label cat litter 
the decline in private label cat litter sales resulted primarily from the continued decline in the coarse cat litter market  as well as a market trend away from private label cat litter products 
the retail and wholesale products group segment operating income for fiscal was  a decrease of  or  from operating income of  in fiscal the decrease was driven primarily by increased advertising costs for our cat pride fresh light cat litter 
in addition  the retail and wholesale products group combined freight  packaging and material costs per ton increased approximately compared to fiscal packaging costs per ton increased approximately due primarily to fluctuations in the price of paper and resin 
freight costs per ton increased approximately primarily as a result of higher diesel fuel prices and other cost increases in the freight industry 
material costs per ton increased approximately due primarily to increased purchases of additives  fragrances and other materials for the production of scoopable cat litters 
these cost increases more than offset the lower cost of fuel used in our manufacturing processes 
see further discussion of manufacturing costs under consolidated results below 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the retail and wholesale products group increased compared to fiscal due primarily to increased advertising expenditures described above 
consolidated results consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscal increased to from in fiscal gross profit improved because of the higher sales described above  a greater proportion of sales from higher margin products and lower costs for fuel per ton produced  primarily natural gas  used to operate kilns that dry our clay 
partially offsetting these positive impacts were higher packaging  freight and material costs per ton 
the increase in packaging and freight costs are described in the operating segment discussions above 
material costs were negatively impacted by a increase in non fuel manufacturing cost per ton produced  including depreciation and amortization 
the increase in non fuel manufacturing costs was attributed to higher depreciation expense and increased manufacturing of products that required purchased additives  fragrances and other materials 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the discussions of each segment operating income above describes the increased selling  general and administrative expenses that were allocated to the operating segments  including approximately  higher advertising costs in the retail and wholesale products group 
the remaining unallocated corporate expenses in fiscal included a higher estimated annual incentive plan bonus accrual and higher costs for the serp 
the incentive bonus expense was based on performance targets that are established for each fiscal year 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the serp 
our effective tax rate was of pre tax income in fiscal compared to in fiscal during fiscal  we generated an additional  in amt credit carryforwards 
consistent with amt credits generated in prior years  we recorded a full valuation allowance against these credits  which increased the fiscal effective tax rate 
a number of factors determine whether or not we will be able to utilize the amt credit carryforwards 
we believe it is more likely than not that we will not realize a benefit from the carryforwards  therefore  a valuation allowance has been established for the full amount of the deferred tax benefit related to the amt credits 
this increase in the effective tax rate was partially offset by a higher deduction for tax mining depletion 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our income taxes 
foreign operations net sales by our foreign subsidiaries during fiscal were  a decrease of  or  from net sales of  during fiscal net sales by our foreign subsidiaries represented of our consolidated net sales during fiscal year net sales declined for our united kingdom subsidiary and for our canadian subsidiary 
bleaching earth and industrial absorbents sales by our united kingdom subsidiary decreased due to a strong competitive and price sensitive marketplace 
both branded and private label cat litter sales for our canadian subsidiary were lower due to the continued decline in the coarse litter market and increased competition 
industrial product sales for our canadian subsidiary were relatively flat 
for fiscal  our foreign subsidiaries reported a net loss of  compared to a net loss of  in fiscal the increase in the net loss was due primarily to lower sales  which were partially offset by a reduction in overhead costs at both our canadian and united kingdom subsidiaries 
identifiable assets of our foreign subsidiaries as of july  were  compared to  as of july  the decrease is primarily due to lower accounts receivable 
liquidity and capital resources our principal capital requirements include funding working capital needs  purchasing and upgrading real estate  equipment and facilities  investing in infrastructure and potential acquisitions 
we have principally used cash generated from operations and  to the extent needed  issuance of debt securities and borrowings under our credit facilities to fund these requirements 
cash and cash equivalents totaled   and  at july   and  respectively 
the following table sets forth certain elements of our consolidated statements of cash flows in thousands fiscal year ended july  july  july  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operations was  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the change was due to working capital fluctuations and changes in other accounts 
the changes in the primary components of working capital and other accounts that impacted operating cash flows for these years are as follows deferred income taxes were  higher at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end due primarily to lower tax depreciation expense and increased accrued expenses  which were partially offset by the impact of a lower postretirement benefits liability 
additionally  the net operating loss previously accrued was released in fiscal as a result of reduced tax depreciation available to the company as determined upon filing the fiscal tax return 
deferred income taxes were  higher at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end due primarily to a higher postretirement benefits liability  benefits from a tax net operating loss and increased accrued expenses  which were partially offset by the impact of higher tax bonus depreciation expense 
see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding income taxes and postretirement benefit plans  respectively 
the change in accrued expenses is discussed below 
accounts receivable  less allowance for doubtful accounts  were  higher at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end the increase was attributed primarily to higher fiscal fourth quarter sales compared to fiscal fourth quarter sales 
accounts receivable  less allowance for doubtful accounts  were  higher at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end the increase was attributed primarily to higher fiscal fourth quarter sales compared to fiscal fourth quarter sales 
the change in both periods is subject to timing of sales and collections and the payment terms provided to various customers 
inventories were  higher at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end increased finished goods inventory values at fiscal year end were attributed to higher costs 
inventories of additives and fragrances increased as the result of production projections for certain products 
inventories were  higher at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end inventories of additives and fragrances increased to meet production requirements for certain products 
prepaid expenses were  lower at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end due primarily to a decrease in prepaid income taxes 
prepaid expenses were  lower at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end due primarily to a decrease in both prepaid income taxes and prepaid advertising costs 
other assets were  higher at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end during fiscal a joint infrastructure project with a local government at one of our plant locations resulted in an other asset of approximately  other assets were  higher at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end the change in other assets for both periods included the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations on non cash assets held by our foreign subsidiaries 
the change in the relative value of the us dollar to both the british pound and the canadian dollar resulted in an increase in other assets in fiscal compared to a decrease in fiscal in addition  an increase in the cash surrender value of life insurance on former key employees contributed to the increase in other assets at both fiscal year end and accounts payable were  higher at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end due primarily to increased income taxes payable  which was partially offset by lower trade accounts payable 
accounts payable were  higher at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end due primarily to increased trade accounts payable 
changes in trade accounts payable in all periods are subject to normal fluctuations in the timing of payments 
accrued expenses were  higher at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end accrued expenses for fiscal were higher for both the discretionary bonus and accrued costs related to capital projects at our manufacturing facilities 
these increases were partially offset by lower accrued advertising expense 
accrued expenses were  higher at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end accrued expenses for fiscal were higher for both the discretionary bonus and advertising expenses 
this increase was partially offset by lower other accrued operating expenses due to the reduced cost of fuel used in our manufacturing processes 
changes in accrued expenses in all periods are also subject to normal fluctuations in the timing of payments 
deferred compensation was  higher at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end and was  higher at fiscal year end compared to fiscal employee deferrals and interest on accumulated deferred compensation balances exceeded payouts in both years 
the increase at fiscal year end was partially offset by a lower accrual for the serp due to an increase in the discount rate used to actuarially value the obligation 
at july  a lower discount rate resulted in a higher serp accrual 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our deferred compensation plans 
pension and other postretirement liabilities  net of the adjustment recorded in stockholders equity  were  lower at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end and were  higher at fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end a higher discount rate required for the actuarial calculation of postretirement benefit obligations resulted in a significantly lower liability at fiscal year end at fiscal year end  a lower discount rate resulted in a significantly higher liability 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our postretirement benefit plans 
net cash used in investing activities cash used in investing activities was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal purchases of investment securities were  greater than disposition in fiscal in fiscal  dispositions of investment securities exceeded purchases by  purchases and dispositions of investment securities in both periods are subject to variations in the timing of investment maturities 
cash used for capital expenditures of  in fiscal included replacement and new machinery at our manufacturing facilities 
capital expenditures in fiscal of  included a new storage facility and replacement of machinery at our manufacturing facilities 
cash used in investing activities was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal dispositions of investment securities were  greater than purchases in fiscal in fiscal  purchases of investment securities exceeded dispositions by  due to the investment of cash received from the issuance of new debt 
purchases and dispositions of investment securities in both periods are subject to variations in the timing of investment maturities 
cash used for capital expenditures of  in fiscal included a new storage facility and replacement of machinery at our manufacturing facilities 
capital expenditures in fiscal of  included new product related projects at our manufacturing facilities  replacement of machinery and land purchases 
net cash used in provided by financing activities cash used in financing activities was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal cash used to purchase treasury stock was  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
payments on long term debt in fiscal were  compared to  in fiscal dividend payments during fiscal of  were higher than the  paid during fiscal due to a dividend rate increase 
proceeds from issuance of common stock and treasury stock related to stock option exercises were  and  in fiscal and  respectively

other total cash and investment balances held by our foreign subsidiaries at july   and were   and  respectively 
cash and investment balances fluctuated due to normal business operations 
see further discussion in the foreign operations section above 
we have a  unsecured revolving credit agreement with bmo harris bank na bmo harris which will expire on december  the credit agreement provides that we may select a variable rate based on either bmo harris prime rate or a libor based rate  plus a margin which varies depending on our debt to earnings ratio  or a fixed rate as agreed between us and bmo harris 
the credit agreement also allows us to obtain foreign letters of credit when necessary 
at july   the variable rates would have been for bmo harris prime based rate or for libor based rate 
the credit agreement contains restrictive covenants that  among other things and under various conditions  limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or to dispose of assets 
the agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum fixed coverage ratio and a minimum consolidated net worth 
as of july  and  there were no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and we were in compliance with its covenants 
on november   we sold at aggregate face value  in senior promissory notes to the prudential insurance company of america  prudential retirement insurance and annuity company  forethought life insurance company  physicians mutual insurance company and bcbsm  inc dba blue cross and blue shield of minnesota pursuant to a note agreement dated november  the note agreement 
the notes bear interest at per annum and mature on august  the proceeds of the sale may be used to fund future principal payments of our debt  acquisitions  stock repurchases  capital expenditures and for working capital purposes 
the note agreement contains certain covenants that restrict our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to  among other things  i incur liens  ii incur indebtedness  iii merge or consolidate  iv sell assets  v sell stock of those certain subsidiaries  vi engage in business that would change the general nature of the business we are engaged in  and vii enter into transactions other than on arm s length terms with affiliates 
we believe that cash flow from operations  availability under our current revolving credit facility and current cash and investment balances will provide adequate cash funds for foreseeable working capital needs  capital expenditures at existing facilities and debt service obligations for at least the next months 
we estimate cash requirements for capital expenditures in fiscal to be higher than in fiscal due to projects at our manufacturing facilities  including capacity expansion projects for our fluids purification products 
in addition  advertising and promotions spending in fiscal is expected to greater than in fiscal our capital requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise 
our ability to fund operations  to make planned capital expenditures  to make scheduled debt payments and to remain in compliance with all of the financial covenants under debt agreements  including the current credit agreement and any successor agreements  depends on our future operating performance  which  in turn  is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors 
the timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions that we complete may also impact our cash requirements 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments our capital requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise 
the following tables summarize our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of july  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt interest on long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations in the third quarter of fiscal  we made a contribution of approximately  to our defined benefit pension plan 
we have not presented this obligation for future years in the table above because the funding requirement can vary from year to year based on changes in the fair value of plan assets and actuarial assumptions 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below for certain information regarding the potential impact of financial market fluctuations on pension plan assets and future funding contributions 
amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts committed less than year years years after years other commercial commitments the obligations above are open purchase orders primarily for packaging and other ingredients used in our products 
the expected timing of payments of these obligations is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different  depending on the time of receipt of goods or services  or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any unconsolidated special purpose entities 
as of july  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
the term off balance sheet arrangement generally means any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party  under which we have i any obligation arising under a guarantee contract  derivative instrument or variable interest  or ii a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support for such assets 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles of the united states 
we review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies annually to ensure that our financial reporting and disclosures provide accurate and transparent information relative to current economic and business environment 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies stated in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the policies listed below involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity 
the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates include income taxes  promotional programs  pension accounting and allowance for doubtful accounts 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate is based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we determine our current and deferred taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes 
the tax effect of the expected reversal of tax differences is recorded at rates currently enacted for each jurisdiction in which we operate 
to the extent that temporary differences will result in future tax benefit  we must estimate the timing of their reversal and whether taxable operating income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any deferred tax assets 
we maintain valuation allowances where it is likely that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the income tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  we take into account such factors as prior earnings history  expected future earnings and other factors that could affect the realization of deferred tax assets 
for example  certain factors  such as depletion and the cost of fuel used in our manufacturing process  are difficult to predict and have a significant impact on our ability to use the deferred tax benefit related to our amt credit carryforwards 
we recorded valuation allowances for income taxes of  and  at july  and  respectively  for the full amount of the deferred tax benefit related to our amt credit and foreign net operating loss carryforwards since we believe it is more likely than not that the benefit of these tax attributes will not be realized 
in addition to valuation allowances  we provide for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet certain recognition thresholds or measurement standards 
amounts for uncertain tax positions are adjusted when new information becomes available or when positions are effectively settled 
our liability for unrecognized tax benefits based on tax positions related to the current and prior fiscal years was  at both july  and see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
trade promotions 
we routinely commit to one time or ongoing trade promotion programs in our retail and wholesale products group 
promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives made directly to consumers  such as coupons  and sales incentives made to customers  such as slotting  discounts based on sales volume  cooperative marketing programs and other arrangements 
all such trade promotion costs are netted against sales 
promotional reserves are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
to estimate trade promotion reserves  we rely on our historical experience with trade spending patterns and that of the industry  current trends and forecasted data 
while we believe our promotional reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgments have been made  estimated amounts could differ from future obligations 
we have accrued liabilities at the end of each period for the estimated trade spending programs 
we recorded liabilities of approximately  and  for trade promotions at july  and  respectively 
pension and postretirement benefit costs 
we calculate our pension and postretirement health benefit obligations and the related effects on results of operations using actuarial models 
to measure the expense and obligations  we must make a variety of estimates including critical assumptions for the discount rate used to value certain liabilities and the expected return on plan assets set aside to fund these costs 
we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually 
other assumptions involving demographic factors  such as retirement age  mortality and turnover  are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect actual experience 
as these assumptions change from period to period  recorded pension and postretirement health benefit amounts and funding requirements could also change 
actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 
the discount rate is the rate assumed to measure the single amount that  if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of high quality debt instruments  would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the pension benefits when due 
the discount rate is subject to change each year 
we refer to an applicable index and the expected duration of the benefit payments to select a discount rate at which we believe the benefits could be effectively settled 
the discount rate was the single equivalent rate that would yield the same present value as the plan s expected cashflows discounted with spot rates on a yield curve of investment grade corporate bonds 
the yield curve is the citigroup pension liability index 
our determination of pension expense or income is based on a market related valuation of plan assets  which is the fair market value 
our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations and historical experience 
the expected long term rate of inflation and risk premiums for the various asset categories are based on general historical returns and inflation rates 
the target allocation of assets is used to develop a composite rate of return assumption 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
trade receivables 
we recognize trade receivables when the risk of loss and title pass to the customer 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical experience and a periodic review of our accounts receivable  including a review of the overall aging of accounts and analysis of specific accounts 
a customer account is determined to be uncollectible when we have completed our internal collection procedures  including termination of shipments  direct customer contact and formal demand of payment 
we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is reasonable  however  the unanticipated default by a customer with a material trade receivable could occur 
we recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  at july  and  respectively 
inventories 
we value inventories at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
inventory costs include the cost of raw materials  packaging supplies  labor and other overhead costs 
we perform a detailed review of our inventory items to determine if an obsolescence reserve adjustment is necessary 
the review surveys all of our operating facilities and sales divisions to ensure that both historical issues and new market trends are considered 
the obsolescence reserve not only considers specific items  but also takes into consideration the overall value of the inventory as of the balance sheet date 
the inventory obsolescence reserve values at july  and were  and  respectively 
reclamation 
during the normal course of our mining process we remove overburden and perform on going reclamation activities 
as overburden is removed from a mine site  it is hauled to a previously mined site and used to refill older sites 
this process allows us to continuously reclaim older mine sites and dispose of overburden simultaneously  therefore minimizing the costs associated with the reclamation process 
on an annual basis we evaluate our potential reclamation liability in accordance with asc  asset retirement and environmental obligations 
as of july  and  we have recorded an estimated net reclamation asset of  and  respectively  and a corresponding estimated reclamation liability of  as of both july  and these values represent the discounted present value of the estimated future mining reclamation costs at the production plants 
the reclamation assets are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the various mines 
the reclamation liabilities are increased based on a yearly accretion charge over the estimated useful lives of the mines 
accounting for reclamation obligations requires that we make estimates unique to each mining operation of the future costs we will incur to complete the reclamation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations 
actual future costs incurred could significantly differ from estimated amounts 
future changes to environmental laws could increase the extent of reclamation work required 
any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amount incurred for reclamation costs 
impairment of goodwill  trademarks and other intangible assets 
we review carrying values of goodwill  trademarks and other indefinite lived intangible assets periodically for possible impairment in accordance asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
our impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to volume  revenue  expense growth rates and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
impairment occurs when the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
our impairment analysis is performed in the first quarter of the fiscal year and when indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors  unanticipated technological changes  competitive activities and acts by governments and courts indicate that an asset may become impaired 
we use judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired 
our analysis in the first quarter of fiscal did not indicate any impairment 
we continue to monitor events  circumstances or changes in the business that might imply a reduction in value and might lead to impairment 
new accounting pronouncements recently adopted accounting standards for our annual goodwill impairment test performed during the first quarter of fiscal  we considered the fasb guidance issued under asc intangibles goodwill and other testing goodwill for impairment  which provides the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine if the annual two step test of goodwill for impairment must be performed 
we did not elect to perform a qualitative assessment and continued to perform the two step test to measure potential goodwill impairment 
there was no impact on our consolidated financial statements as a result of this new guidance 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted the fasb guidance issued under asc comprehensive income presentation of comprehensive income 
this guidance requires presentation of the components of net income and other comprehensive income either in one continuous statement  referred to as the statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate consecutive statements 
the requirements eliminate the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of stockholders equity 
in accordance with the new requirements  and consistent with our past practice for our quarterly reports on form q  we elected to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income in two separate consecutive statements 
the components recognized in net income or other comprehensive income did not change and there was no impact on our consolidated financial statements as a result of adopting this new guidance 
recently issued accounting standards in july  the fasb issued guidance under asc intangibles goodwill and other testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  that provides the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the second  quantitative impairment test 
if  based on the qualitative assessment of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset fair value is more than its carrying amount  then it is not necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then the quantitative impairment test must also be performed to identify and measure any potential impairment amount 
we will consider the option provided in this guidance for our annual indefinite lived asset impairment testing for our fiscal year beginning august  in february  the fasb issued guidance under asc comprehensive income reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  that requires presentation by the respective line items of net income  either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes  information about significant amounts required under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap to be reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income in their entirety 
for amounts not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures that provide additional details about those amounts 
these presentation requirements will be effective for our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ending october  and will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements
