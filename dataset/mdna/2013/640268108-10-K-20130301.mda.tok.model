item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview strategic direction of our business we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing a pipeline of drug candidates that utilize our pegylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms  which are designed to enable the development of new molecular entities that target known mechanisms of action 
our current proprietary pipeline is comprised of drug candidates across a number of therapeutic areas including oncology  pain  anti infectives  and immunology 
our research and development activities involve small molecule drugs  peptides and other biologic drug candidates 
we create innovative drug candidates by using our proprietary advanced polymer conjugate technologies and expertise to modify the chemical structure of pharmacophores to create new molecular entities 
polymer chemistry is a science focused on the synthesis or bonding of polymer architectures with drug molecules to alter the properties of a molecule when it is bonded with polymers 
additionally  we may utilize established pharmacologic targets to engineer a new drug candidate relying on a combination of the known properties of these targets and our proprietary polymer chemistry technology and expertise 
our drug candidates are designed to improve the overall benefits and use of a drug for patients by improving the metabolism  distribution  pharmacokinetics  pharmacodynamics  half life and or bioavailability of drugs 
our objective is to apply our advanced polymer conjugate technology platform to create new drug candidates in multiple therapeutic areas that address large potential markets 
our most advanced proprietary product candidate  naloxegol formerly known as nktr  is a peripheral opioid antagonist which has completed phase clinical studies for the treatment of opioid induced constipation oic 
we are a party to an exclusive worldwide license agreement with astrazeneca for the global development and commercialization of naloxegol and naloxegol fixed dose combination products formerly known as nktr 
the core phase clinical development program for naloxegol  which astrazeneca calls the kodiac program  is comprised of four clinical trials which are designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of naloxegol for the treatment of oic in patients with non cancer related pain 
the outcome and timing of the naloxegol development program will have a substantial impact on our financial condition as we are entitled to up to million in regulatory filing milestones and million in commercial launch milestones 
on november   astrazeneca announced positive top line results from two phase efficacy and safety clinical trials and from a safety extension trial kodiac   and 
on february   astrazeneca announced positive top line results from the long term safety study kodiac of naloxegol in patients with oic 
astrazeneca has stated that it plans to submit an nda filing in the us and a marketing authorization application maa filing in the eu in the third quarter of  pending astrazeneca s final preparation of the registration package and a pre nda meeting with the fda 
in the event regulatory approval filings are submitted by astrazeneca and accepted by the us food and drug administration fda and by the european medicines agency ema  we would be entitled to receive million in milestone payments 
as a 
table of contents result  the outcome of astrazeneca s determination to make regulatory filings for naloxegol with the fda and ema is critical to our financial position in as well as our future business prospects as a result of the significant economic stake that we have in success of the potential commercialization of naloxegol 
our second most advanced proprietary drug candidate  etirinotecan pegol formerly known as nktr  is a next generation topoisomerase i inhibitor 
etirinotecan pegol is currently being evaluated as a single agent therapy in a phase open label  randomized  multicenter clinical study in patients with metastatic breast cancer 
this phase clinical study  which we call the beacon study breast cancer outcomes with nktr  is scheduled to enroll approximately patients with metastatic breast cancer that have previously received treatment with an anthracycline  a taxane  and capecitabine 
the beacon study will require a substantial investment over the next two years 
in november  etirinotecan pegol was designated by the fda as a fast track development program for the treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer progressing after treatment with an anthracycline  a taxane  and capecitabine 
we have completed an expanded phase clinical study for etirinotecan pegol in patients with platinum resistant ovarian cancer 
we are currently in the process of finalizing the data in furtherance of planned meetings with health authorities in which will guide our future development and regulatory strategy for etirinotecan pegol in ovarian cancer 
in addition  a phase clinical study for etirinotecan pegol in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer is still open for enrollment 
we have a significant collaboration with bayer healthcare llc bayer to develop bay amikacin inhale  formerly known as nktr  which is an inhaled solution of amikacin  an aminoglycoside antibiotic  that has completed phase clinical development 
we originally developed the liquid aerosol inhalation platform and amikacin inhale and entered into a collaboration agreement with bayer in august to further advance the drug candidate s development and potential commercialization 
the stability studies on the nebulizer device that needed to be completed prior to the start of the phase clinical study were successfully completed in february the phase clinical program is expected to be initiated by bayer in march in  bayer achieved agreement with the fda on the design of the planned phase clinical studies of bay under the special protocol assessment process that is intended to support the submission of a nda if the planned phase clinical study is successful 
we also have a significant collaboration with baxter healthcare to identify and develop pegylated drug candidates with the objective of providing new long acting therapies for hemophilia patients 
under the terms of this collaboration  we are providing a license to our intellectual property and our pegylation technology and expertise 
baxter is responsible for all clinical development 
the first drug candidate in this collaboration  bax  is a longer acting pegylated form of a full length recombinant factor viii rfviii protein which has completed phase clinical development in patients with hemophilia a 
in february  baxter initiated a phase multi center  open label clinical study called prolong ate that will enroll more than previously treated adult patients with severe hemophilia a to assess the efficacy  safety and pharmacokinetics of bax for prophylaxis and on demand treatment of bleeding 
if bax is approved by health authorities and is successfully commercialized by baxter  this would represent a substantial royalty revenue opportunity for us  subject to significant risks and uncertainties relating to regulatory approval with health authorities and subsequent commercial success 
while the late stage clinical development programs described above are key elements of the future success of our company  we believe it is critically important that we continue to make substantial investments in our earlier stage drug candidate pipeline 
for example  in april we advanced nktr  our short acting opioid drug candidate  into phase clinical studies and in july we advanced nktr into a phase clinical study and plan to conduct a human abuse liability study for nktr in the first half of while we believe that our substantial investment in research and development has the potential to create significant value if one or more of our drug candidates demonstrate positive clinical results and receive regulatory approval in one or more major markets  drug research and development is an inherently uncertain process and there is a high risk of failure at every stage prior to approval and the timing and outcome of clinical trial results are extremely difficult 
table of contents to predict 
clinical development successes and failures can have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on our scientific and medical prospects  financial prospects  financial condition  and market value 
historically  we have entered into a number of license and supply contracts under which we manufactured and supplied our proprietary pegylation reagents on a cost plus or fixed price basis 
our current strategy is to manufacture and supply pegylation reagents to support our proprietary drug candidates or our third party collaborators where we have a strategic development and commercialization relationship or where we derive substantial economic benefit 
as a result  whenever possible  we are renegotiating or not seeking renewal of legacy manufacturing supply arrangements that do not include a strategic development or commercialization component 
for example  in october  we entered into a supply  dedicated suite and manufacturing guarantee agreement with amgen  inc and amgen manufacturing  limited  which has significantly amended economic and other terms in the non exclusive supply and license agreement we previously entered into with amgen in in addition  in december  we entered into an amended manufacturing and supply agreement with merck through its acquisition of schering plough corporation to provide for transfer to an alternative manufacturer and revised economics for an interim supply arrangement until that transition is completed 
key developments and trends in liquidity and capital resources at december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents  and investments in marketable securities and million in indebtedness 
the indebtedness includes million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due july  which we issued during the three months ended september   but excludes our long term liability relating to the sale of future royalties under the purchase and sale agreement with rpi finance trust rpi 
as is further described in note  this royalty obligation liability will not be settled in cash  but we may be required to make a payment of up to million in if the worldwide net sales thresholds of mircera in are not met 
during the year ended december   we retired million in aggregate principal amount of our previously outstanding convertible subordinated notes 
as of december   we had at least twelve months of working capital to fund our current business plans 
we expect the clinical development of our proprietary drug candidates including etirinotecan pegol  amikacin inhale  nktr  and nktr will require significant investment in order to continue to advance in clinical development with the objective of entering into a collaboration partnership or obtaining regulatory approval 
however  we have no credit facility or any other sources of committed capital 
in addition  while in the past we have received a number of significant payments from license and collaboration agreements and other significant transactions  we do not currently anticipate completing new transactions with substantial upfront payments in the near term 
our current business plan is also subject to significant uncertainties and risks as a result of  among other factors  expenses being higher than anticipated  unplanned expenses  cash receipts being lower than anticipated  and the need to satisfy contingent liabilities including litigation matters and indemnification obligations 
the availability and terms of various financing alternatives substantially depend on the success or failure of our drug development programs including naloxegol  etirinotecan pegol  bax  amikacin inhale  nktr  and nktr the availability and terms of financing alternatives and any future significant payments from existing or new collaborations all depend on the positive outcome of ongoing or planned clinical studies  whether we or our partners are successful in obtaining health authority approvals in major markets  and if approved  the commercial success of these drugs 
in particular  we are entitled to up to million of regulatory and commercial launch milestones under our license agreement with astrazeneca  million of which is related to astrazeneca submitting regulatory approval filings for naloxegol with the fda and with the ema 
astrazeneca has indicated that it plans to submit regulatory filings for naloxegol subject to subject to astrazeneca s final preparation of the registration package and a pre nda meeting with the fda 
in the event we do not enter into any new collaboration partnerships with significant up front payments or do not receive the naloxegol regulatory milestone payments in  we would likely be required to pursue financing alternatives 

table of contents in the event we determine to explore financing alternatives  our objective would be to first pursue financing alternatives that are not dilutive to the ownership of our common stock security holders 
however  if non dilutive financing alternatives are not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all  we could be required to pursue dilutive equity based financing alternatives such as an offering of convertible debt or common stock

product sales royalty revenues non cash royalty revenue related to sale of future royalties n a license  collaboration and other total revenue our revenue is derived from our collaboration agreements  under which we may receive product sales revenue  royalties  license fees  milestone payments or contract research payments 
revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
the amount of upfront fees received under our license and collaboration agreements allocated to continuing obligations  such as manufacturing and supply commitments  are recognized ratably over our expected performance period under the arrangement 
as a result  there may be significant variations in the timing of receipt of cash payments and our recognition of revenue 
we make our best estimate of the period over which we expect to fulfill our performance obligations 
given the uncertainties in research and development collaborations  significant judgment is required by us to determine the performance periods 
product sales product sales include fixed price and cost plus manufacturing and supply agreements with our collaboration partners 
product sales increased during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as a result of increased product demand from a number of our collaboration partners 
product sales decreased during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due in part to the transfer of manufacturing activities to certain collaboration partners 
the timing of shipments is based solely on the demand and requirements of our collaboration partners and is not ratable throughout the year 
we expect product sales to increase in as compared to royalty revenues and non cash royalty revenue related to sale of future royalties we receive royalty revenue from certain of our collaboration partners based on their net sales of commercial products 
royalty revenues decreased during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of the sale of the royalties we receive from ucb s cimzia and roche s mircera product sales as is further described below 
royalty revenues increased during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of the increase in royalties received from net sales of cimzia and mircera 
we expect royalties to decrease in as compared to 
table of contents during the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million  respectively  in aggregate royalties from net sales of cimzia and mircera 
in february  we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments on cimzia and mircera effective for all periods from january  through the life of the royalty obligation 
as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  this royalty sale transaction has been recorded as a liability that amortizes over the estimated royalty payment period 
as a result of this liability accounting  even though the royalties from ucb and roche are remitted directly to the purchaser  we will continue to record revenue for these royalties 
during the year ended december   we recognized million in aggregate royalties from net sales of cimzia and mircera  of which the million recognized in the three months ended march  was retained by us as these amounts resulted from product sales in the fourth quarter of and the million recognized in the nine months ended december  was remitted directly to the purchaser as these amounts resulted from product sales in the first three quarters of we expect non cash royalties from net sales of cimzia and mircera to increase in as compared to license  collaboration and other revenue license  collaboration and other revenue includes amortization of upfront payments and milestone payments received in connection with our license and collaboration agreements and reimbursed research and development expenses 
the level of license  collaboration and other revenue depends in part upon the estimated amortization period of the upfront payments  the achievement of milestones  the continuation of existing collaborations  the amount of reimbursed research and development work  and entering into new collaboration agreements  if any 
license  collaboration and other revenue for the year ended december  decreased compared to the year ended december  primarily due to the recognition in of a million license fee from an agreement signed in september license  collaboration and other revenue for the year ended december  decreased compared to the year ended december  primarily due to the complete recognition as of december  of the million upfront payment received in the fourth quarter of from astrazeneca in connection with the global license agreement for naloxegol formerly known as nktr and naloxegol fixed dose combination program formerly known as nktr this decrease was partially offset by the recognition of the million license fee noted above  million in milestones earned under existing collaboration agreements  and increases in revenue recognized in from upfront payments received by us during we expect license  collaboration and other revenue in to increase as compared to primarily as a result of the recognition of milestones under existing collaboration agreements 
in the event regulatory approval filings for naloxegol are submitted by astrazeneca and accepted by the fda and by the ema  we would be entitled to million in milestone payments 
if these filings occur in  our license  collaboration and other revenue in will increase significantly from the timing and future success of our drug development programs and those of our collaboration partners are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties

the decrease in cost of goods sold during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily due to the million decrease in product sales in and an increase in overall commercial and proprietary manufacturing activity in compared to that resulted in decreased costs per unit 
the increase in product gross margin during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily due to the different mix of products sold and the decreased costs per unit in resulting from increased manufacturing activity

research and development expense also includes certain overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities related costs 
the increase in research and development expense for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to the million increase in direct research and development program costs  a substantial portion of which is attributable to the etirinotecan pegol nktr phase beacon clinical study initiated in december as well as the nktr phase clinical study initiated in july in addition  research and development expense increased due to a million increase in salaries and employee benefits resulting from increased headcount to support our expanded clinical development activities 
the increase in research and development expense for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to a million increase in direct research and development program and materials costs  a million increase in salaries and employee benefits  and a million increase in support and facilities related costs  which includes increased non cash depreciation and non cash rent expenses related to the move to our facility in the mission bay area of san francisco  california mission bay facility at the end of we utilize our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple development and research programs

we partnered this program with bayer healthcare llc in august as part of the novartis pulmonary asset sale in  we retained an exclusive license to this technology for the development and commercialization of this drug candidate 
we partnered this program with astrazeneca ab astrazeneca in in general  all development costs incurred by us after partnering with astrazeneca are reimbursed by astrazeneca 

table of contents we expect research and development expense to increase in as compared to and to continue at or above the level for the next several years 
we plan to continue to advance etirinotecan pegol in the phase beacon study for metastatic breast cancer for which we expect patient enrollment to continue throughout and the clinical study to continue through we are also finishing data analysis from the expanded phase clinical study for etirinotecan pegol in patients with platinum resistant refractory ovarian cancer in preparation for meetings with health authorities in at the same time  we continue to advance the phase clinical study for etirinotecan pegol in colorectal cancer patients 
our current plan is to fund all of the clinical development costs for etirinotecan pegol for the foreseeable future without reimbursement from a collaboration partner 
the clinical development costs for the beacon clinical study will continue to be significant 
we estimate that the total third party and direct material costs over the life of the beacon study will range from approximately million to million  of which million was incurred through the end of we are unable to estimate the timing or costs to complete the clinical development for etirinotecan pegol across all the potential oncology indications 
in addition to our etirinotecan pegol development activities  in  we plan to continue to enroll the ongoing phase clinical study for nktr and also initiate and complete a human abuse liability study for nktr further  if the phase clinical results are successful  we plan to begin preparations for the commencement of phase clinical studies for nktr we also plan to continue to advance the development of nktr we are also actively advancing the preclinical development work for nktr and nktr in preparation for entering clinical development in the timeframe 
in addition  we plan to continue to make substantial investments to support the clinical and commercial manufacturing preparation and scale up for the nebulizer devices to supply bayer for the amikacin inhale program 
under our collaboration agreement with bayer  we are responsible for all clinical and commercial supply of the nebulizer devices for this drug candidate 
we do not expect to have any significant future research and development costs associated with naloxegol or the naloxegol fixed dose combination products as astrazeneca is responsible for all further development and commercialization costs for these drug candidates 
in addition to our drug candidates that we plan to have in clinical development during and beyond  we believe it is vitally important to continue our substantial investment in a diverse pipeline of new drug candidates to continue to build the value of our drug candidate pipeline and our business 
our discovery research organization is identifying new drug candidates by applying our pegylation technology platform to a wide range of molecule classes  including small molecules and large proteins  peptides and antibodies  across multiple therapeutic areas 
we plan to continue to advance our most promising early research drug candidates into preclinical development with the objective to advance these early stage research programs to human clinical studies over the next several years 
our expenditures on current and future preclinical and clinical development programs are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion 
in order to advance our drug candidates through clinical development  each drug candidate must be tested in numerous preclinical safety  toxicology and efficacy studies 
we then conduct clinical studies for our drug candidates that take several years to complete 
the cost and time required to complete clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a clinical development program as a result of a variety of factors  including but not limited to the number of patients required for a given clinical study design  the length of time required to enroll clinical study participants  the number and location of sites included in the clinical studies  the clinical studies designs required by the health authorities ie primary  secondary end points and the size of the study needed to demonstrate efficacy and safety outcomes  the potential for changing standards of care for the target patient population  
table of contents the competition for patient recruitment from competitive drug candidates being studied in the same clinical setting  the costs of producing supplies of the product candidates needed for clinical trials and regulatory submissions  the safety and efficacy profile of the drug candidate  the use of clinical research organizations to assist with the management of the trials  and the costs and timing of  and the ability to secure  approvals from government health authorities 
furthermore  our strategy includes the potential of entering into collaborations with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of some of our drug candidates such as those collaborations that we have already completed for naloxegol and amikacin inhale 
in these situations  the clinical development program and process for a drug candidate and the estimated completion date will largely be under the control of that third party and not under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our drug candidates will be subject to future collaborations or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements 
the risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in item a risk factors 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects  anticipated completion dates or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from a collaboration arrangement or the commercialization of a drug candidate

as a result  we concluded that the combined carrying value of the land and building exceeded fair value and we recorded an impairment loss of million in march no further impairment losses were recorded in the year ended december   however  until we dispose of these assets  we will update our analysis of their fair value on a regular basis and such updates could result in further impairment charges in future periods

table of contents the increase in interest expense for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is attributable to the interest expense recorded on the senior secured notes we issued in on july   we issued million of senior secured notes maturing on july  in connection with this transaction  we retired a principal amount of million of our million in aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes in exchange for million in principal amount of senior secured notes 
we repaid the remaining million in principal amount of convertible subordinated notes in full at maturity on september  the increase in non cash interest expense on liability related to sale of future royalties for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is attributable to the royalty sale transaction that we completed in on february   we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments on cimzia and mircera in exchange for million 
as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  this royalty sale transaction has been recorded as a liability that amortizes over the estimated royalty payment period as cimzia and mircera royalties are remitted directly to the purchaser 
we impute interest on the transaction and record interest expense at the effective interest rate  which we currently estimated to be approximately 
there are a number of factors that could materially affect the estimated interest rate and we will assess this estimate on a periodic basis 
as a result  future interest rates could differ significantly and any such change in interest rate will be adjusted prospectively 
as a result of the timing of the royalty sale transaction and the issuance of the senior secured notes in  we expect interest expense and non cash interest expense to increase in as compared to the decrease in interest expense for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to the complete amortization of deferred financing costs during relating to our convertible subordinated notes that matured in september liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through revenue from product sales  royalties and research and development contracts  as well as public and private placements of debt and equity 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities of million and indebtedness of million 
the indebtedness includes million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due july   but excludes our long term liability relating to the sale of future royalties 
as is further described in note to our consolidated financial statements  this royalty obligation liability will not be settled in cash  but we may be required to make a payment of up to million in if the worldwide net sales thresholds of mircera in are not met 
on july   we issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes 
in connection with this transaction  we retired a principal amount of million of our million in aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes in exchange for million in principal amount of senior secured notes 
as a result of these transactions  we received cash of million  less approximately million in transaction costs  of which million is required to be maintained in a restricted account until july  on september   we repaid the remaining million in principal amount on the convertible subordinated notes 
additionally at december   we had letter of credit arrangements with certain financial institutions and vendors  including our landlord  totaling million 
these letters of credit will expire during and are secured by investments of similar amounts 
we have no material credit facility or other material committed sources of capital 
as of december   we had at least twelve months of working capital to fund our current business plans 
we expect the clinical development of our proprietary drug candidates including etirinotecan pegol nktr  amikacin inhale  nktr  and nktr will require significant investment in order to continue to advance in clinical development with the objective of entering into a collaboration partnership or obtaining regulatory approval 
however  we have no credit facility or any other sources of committed capital 
in addition  while in the past we have received a number of significant payments from license and collaboration 
table of contents agreements and other significant transactions  we do not currently anticipate completing new transactions with substantial upfront payments in the near term 
our current business plan is also subject to significant uncertainties and risks as a result of  among other factors  expenses being higher than anticipated  unplanned expenses  cash receipts being lower than anticipated  and the need to satisfy contingent liabilities including litigation matters and indemnification obligations 
the availability and terms of various financing alternatives substantially depend on the success or failure of our drug development programs including naloxegol  bax  amikacin inhale  etirinotecan pegol  nktr  and nktr the availability and terms of financing alternatives and any future significant payments from existing or new collaborations all depend on the positive outcome of ongoing or planned clinical studies  whether we or our partners are successful in obtaining health authority approvals in major markets  and if approved  the commercial success of these drugs 
in particular  we are entitled to up to million of regulatory and commercial launch milestones under our license agreement with astrazeneca  million of which is related to astrazeneca submitting regulatory approval filings for naloxegol with the fda and with the ema 
astrazeneca has indicated that it plans to submit regulatory filings for naloxegol subject to astrazeneca s preparation of the nda submission package and a pre nda meeting with the fda 
in the event we do not enter into any new collaboration partnerships with significant up front payments or do not receive the naloxegol regulatory milestone payments in  we would likely be required to pursue financing alternatives 
in the event we determine to explore financing alternatives  our objective would be to first pursue financing alternatives that are not dilutive to the ownership of our common stock security holders 
however  if non dilutive financing alternatives are not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all  we could be required to pursue dilutive equity based financing alternatives such as an offering of convertible debt or common stock 
due to the potential for continued uncertainty in the credit markets in and thereafter  we may experience reduced liquidity with respect to some of our investments in marketable securities 
these investments are generally held to maturity  which is less than two years 
however  if the need arises to liquidate such securities before maturity  we may experience losses on liquidation 
at december   the average time to maturity of the investments held in our portfolio was approximately four months and the maturity of any single investment did not exceed two years 
to date we have not experienced any liquidity issues with respect to these securities  but if such issues arise  we may be required to hold some  or all  of these securities until maturity 
we believe that  even allowing for potential liquidity issues with respect to these securities  our remaining cash  cash equivalents  and investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
cash flows from operating activities cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended december  totaled million  which includes million of net operating cash uses  partially offset by the receipt of million from collaboration agreements 
net operating cash uses also include million in interest payments on our convertible subordinated notes retired in full on september  we expect that cash flows used in operating activities  excluding upfront and milestone payments received  if any  will increase in as a result of increased spending on our proprietary research and development programs  in particular  our beacon study 
cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended december  totaled million  which includes million for semi annual interest payments on our convertible subordinated notes  million of prepayments to certain vendors in our beacon study  and million of other net operating cash uses  partially offset by the receipt of million from collaboration agreements  of which million was included in accounts receivable at december  resulting from an upfront payment obligation arising from an amendment to one of our manufacturing and supply agreements 
during the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities totaled million  which primarily consisted of spending on operating costs and expenses and includes million for interest payments

our capital expenditures were higher in as we constructed the leasehold improvements for the mission bay facility and completed our research and development facility in hyderabad  india
