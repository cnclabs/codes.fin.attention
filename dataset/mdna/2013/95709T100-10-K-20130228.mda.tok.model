executive summary description of business we are the largest electric utility in kansas 
we produce  transmit and sell electricity at retail to approximately  customers in kansas under the regulation of the kcc 
we also supply electric energy at wholesale to municipalities and electric cooperatives in kansas under the regulation of ferc 
we have contracts for the sale  purchase or exchange of wholesale electricity with other utilities 
earnings per share following is a summary of our net income and basic eps for the years ended december  and year ended december  change dollars in thousands  except per share amounts net income attributable to common stock earnings per common share  basic net income attributable to common stock increased due primarily to higher retail prices  reduced depreciation expense and our having recorded an additional million in corporate owned life insurance coli benefits 
these items were offset partially by increases in some operating costs  as authorized in the april kcc order  and our having recorded a million gain on the sale of a non utility investment in contributing to the higher operating costs was our having reversed million of previously accrued liabilities in as a result of settling litigation 
see the discussion under operating results below for additional information 
in addition  basic eps was impacted by our having had more average equivalent common shares outstanding in due primarily to the issuance of additional shares in the latter part of to settle forward sale transactions 
key factors affecting our performance the principal business  economic and other factors that affect our operations and financial performance include weather conditions  the economy  customer conservation efforts  the performance  operation and maintenance of our electric generating facilities and networks  conditions in the fuel  wholesale electricity and energy markets  rate and other regulations and costs of addressing public policy initiatives including environmental regulations  the availability of and our access to liquidity and capital resources  and capital market conditions 

table of contents strategy we expect to continue operating as a vertically integrated  regulated  electric utility 
we strive to optimize flexibility in our planning and operations to be able to respond to uncertain and changing conditions 
significant elements of our strategy include maintaining a flexible and diverse energy supply portfolio 
in doing so  we continue to make environmental upgrades to our coal fired power plants  develop renewable generation  build and upgrade our electrical infrastructure  and develop systems and programs to help customers use energy more efficiently 
current trends environmental regulation environmental laws and regulations affecting our operations  which relate primarily to air quality  water quality  the use of water  and the handling  disposal and clean up of hazardous and non hazardous substances and wastes  continue to evolve and have become more stringent and costly over time 
we have incurred and will continue to incur significant capital and other expenditures  and may potentially need to limit the use of some of our power plants  to comply with existing and new environmental laws and regulations 
while certain of these costs are recoverable through the ecrr and ultimately we expect all such costs to be reflected in the prices we are allowed to charge  we cannot assure that all such costs will be recovered or that they will be recovered in a timely manner 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies  for additional information regarding environmental laws and regulations 
air emissions the operation of power plants results in emissions of mercury  acid gases and other air toxics 
in  the epa published mats for power plants  which replaces the prior federal camr and requires significant reductions in mercury  acid gases and other emissions 
companies impacted by the new standards will have up to three years  or four years with approval from a state environmental regulatory agency  and in certain limited circumstances up to five years  to comply 
we have obtained approval from our state environmental regulatory agency and expect to be compliant with the new standards within four years 
we continue to evaluate the new standards and believe that our related investment will be less than million 
in mid  the epa finalized csapr requiring states  including kansas  missouri and oklahoma  to further reduce power plant emissions of so and nox 
under csapr  reductions in annual so and nox emissions were required to begin january  with further reductions required beginning january the epa also published a final supplemental rule to csapr later in requiring five states  including missouri and oklahoma  to make summertime reductions in nox emissions beginning in may although kansas was included in the original proposed rule  the final supplemental rule instead called for the epa to revisit kansas status once kansas submitted an ozone state implementation plan 
in august  the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit vacated csapr and remanded the rule to the epa to promulgate a replacement 
in october  the epa filed a petition with the court requesting a rehearing before the full court 
in january  the court issued orders declining to rehear the case 
we cannot at this time predict how the epa may proceed with rulemaking  however  based on our current and planned environmental controls  if the regulations were to be reinstated or replaced  either in part or in whole  we do not believe the impact on our operations and consolidated financial results would be material 
greenhouse gases in march  the epa proposed an nsps that would limit co emissions for new and modified electric generating units 
we are currently evaluating the proposal and believe it could impact our future generation plans if it becomes a final rule 
the epa has indicated that a final rule could be issued in the epa is also expected to propose a ghg nsps for existing generating units 
we cannot at this time determine the impact of such a performance standard on our operations and consolidated financial results  but we believe the costs to comply could be material 

table of contents under regulations known as the tailoring rule  the epa is regulating ghg emissions from certain stationary sources 
the regulations are being implemented pursuant to two federal clean air act programs which impose recordkeeping and monitoring requirements and also mandate the implementation of bact for projects that cause a significant increase in ghg emissions defined to be more than  tons or more per year or  tons or more per year  depending on various factors 
the epa has issued guidance on what bact entails for the control of ghgs and individual states are now required to determine what controls are required for facilities within their jurisdiction on a case by case basis 
we cannot at this time determine the impact of these regulations on our operations and consolidated financial results  but we believe the costs to comply with the regulations could be material 
regulation of coal combustion byproducts in the course of operating our coal generation plants  we produce ccbs  including fly ash  gypsum and bottom ash  which we must handle  recycle  process or dispose of 
we recycle some of our ash production  principally by selling to the aggregate industry 
in  the epa proposed a rule to regulate ccbs  which we believe might impair our ability to recycle ash or require additional ccb handling  processing and storage equipment  or both 
the epa is expected to issue a final rule in or sooner 
while we cannot at this time estimate the impact and costs associated with future regulations of ccbs  we believe the impact on our operations and consolidated financial results could be material 
national ambient air quality standards under the federal clean air act  the epa sets naaqs for certain emissions considered harmful to public health and the environment  including pm  nox  co and so  which result from fossil fuel combustion 
areas meeting the naaqs are designated attainment areas while those that do not meet the naaqs are considered nonattainment areas 
each state must develop a plan to bring nonattainment areas into compliance with the naaqs 
naaqs must be reveiwed by epa at five year intervals 
kdhe proposed to designate portions of the kansas city area nonattainment for the eight hour ozone standard 
the epa has not acted on kdhe proposed designation of the kansas city area and it is uncertain when  or if  such a designation might occur 
the wichita area also exceeded the eight hour ozone standard and could be designated nonattainment in the future potentially impacting our operations 
in december  the epa strengthened an existing naaqs for pm 
the epa anticipates making initial attainment nonattainment designations under this rule by the end of we are currently evaluating the rule  however  we cannot at this time predict the impact it may have on our operations or consolidated financial results  but it could be material 
in  the epa strengthened the naaqs for both nox and so we continue to communicate with our regulators regarding these standards and are currently evaluating what impact this could have on our operations 
if we are required to install additional equipment to control emissions at our facilities  the revised naaqs could have a material impact on our operations and consolidated financial results 
the epa is required to review the naaqs for ozone in and is likely to propose a more stringent standard 
water we discharge some of the water used in our operations 
this water may contain substances deemed to be pollutants 
the epa delayed its plans to propose revisions to the rules governing such discharges from coal fired power plants to with final action on the proposed rules expected to occur in although we cannot at this time determine the timing or impact of any new regulations  more stringent regulations could have a material impact on our operations and consolidated financial results 
in  the epa issued a proposed rule that would set stricter technology standards for cooling water intake structures at power plants over concerns about impacts to aquatic life 
we are currently evaluating the proposed rule as well as recent nationally issued information requests from the epa 
the epa is expected to finalize the rule in  however  because the rule has yet to be finalized  we cannot predict the impact it may have on our operations or consolidated financial results  but it could be material 
since kansas is in a severe drought and water remains a critical resource to our business  as well as the state economy  we have increased our attention to water quantity matters 
we will continue to refine our contingency plans should the drought persist 

table of contents renewable energy standard kansas law mandates that we maintain a minimum amount of renewable energy sources 
through  net renewable generation capacity must be of the average peak demand for the three prior years  subject to limited exceptions 
this requirement increases to for years through and for and thereafter 
in  we began purchasing under year supply contracts the renewable energy produced from approximately mw of additional wind generation  which  together with existing facilities  supply contracts and renewable energy credits  will allow us to satisfy the net renewable generation requirement through and contribute toward meeting the increased requirements beginning in if we are unable to meet future requirements  our operations and consolidated financial results could be adversely impacted 
regulation of nuclear generating station additional regulation of wolf creek resulting from nrc oversight of the plant performance or from changing regulations generally  including those that could potentially result from natural disasters or any event that might occur at any nuclear power plant anywhere in the world  may result in increased operating and capital expenditures 
we cannot estimate the cost associated with such increases  but they could be material to our operations and consolidated financial results 
in january  wolf creek experienced a loss of off site power that resulted in an unscheduled outage  with the plant returning to normal operations in march the nrc increased its oversight of wolf creek following the loss of off site power 
we expect future increases in operating costs due to increased nrc oversight and efforts to comply with new industry wide regulations adopted by the nrc in future extended or unscheduled shutdowns of wolf creek could cause us to purchase replacement power  rely more heavily on our other generating units and reduce amounts of power available for us to sell in the wholesale market 
allowance for funds used during construction allowance for funds used during construction afudc represents the allowed cost of capital used to finance utility construction activity 
we compute afudc by applying a composite rate to qualified construction work in progress 
we credit other income for equity funds and interest expense for borrowed funds for the amount of afudc capitalized as construction cost on the accompanying consolidated statements of income as follows year ended december  in thousands borrowed funds equity funds total average afudc rates we expect afudc for both borrowed funds and equity funds to fluctuate over the next several years as we execute our capital expenditure program 
interest expense we expect interest expense to increase over the next several years as we issue new debt securities to fund our capital expenditure program 
we believe this increase will be reflected in the prices we are permitted to charge customers  as cost of capital will be a component of future rate proceedings and is also recognized in some of the other rate adjustments we are permitted to make 
in addition  short term interest rates are extremely low by historical standards 
we cannot predict to what extent these conditions will continue 
outstanding shares of common stock we expect the number of outstanding shares of westar energy common stock to increase over the next several years as we issue additional shares to fund our capital expenditure program 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  common and preferred stock  for additional information regarding our share issuances 

table of contents customer growth and usage residential customer additions have slowed and electricity demand is stable to slightly declining due principally to the effects of the economic downturn and energy efficiency measures 
absent an economic recovery to conditions similar to those preceding the downturn  we believe such additions will continue to be significantly lower than historical levels 
in addition  with the numerous energy efficiency policy initiatives promulgated through federal  state and local governments  as well as industry  we believe customers will continue to adopt more energy efficiency and conservation measures which will suppress the rate of demand for electricity 
outlook in  we expect to maintain our current business strategy and regulatory approach 
subject to regulatory approvals  we anticipate price increases in the form of formulae that track changes in certain of our costs 
we plan to file an abbreviated rate review in april for recovery of capital costs associated with approximately million of our share of the la cygne environmental upgrades 
assuming normal weather in line with the historical average  we expect retail electricity sales to be about higher than weather normalized sales driven primarily by increased industrial demand 
in addition  we anticipate increased operating and maintenance expenses  including maintenance costs for our power plants  and higher selling  general and administrative expenses  some of which will be offset in revenues 
we plan to contribute million to the westar energy and wolf creek pension and post retirement benefit plans in to help fund our capital spending as provided under future cash requirements below  we plan to issue long term debt in addition to utilizing short term borrowings and we expect to issue common stock to settle forward sale transactions 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  contains a summary of our significant accounting policies  many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions by management 
the policies highlighted below have an impact on our reported results that may be material due to the levels of judgment and subjectivity necessary to account for uncertain matters or their susceptibility to change 
regulatory accounting we currently apply accounting standards that recognize the economic effects of rate regulation 
accordingly  we have recorded regulatory assets and liabilities when required by a regulatory order or based on regulatory precedent 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in our prices 
regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in revenue or refunds to customers 
the deferral of costs as regulatory assets is appropriate only when the future recovery of such costs is probable 
in assessing probability  we consider such factors as specific regulatory orders  regulatory precedent and the current regulatory environment 
were we to deem it no longer probable that we would recover such costs  we would record a charge against income in the amount of the related regulatory assets 
as of december   we had recorded regulatory assets currently subject to recovery in future prices of approximately billion and regulatory liabilities of million  as discussed in greater detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  rate matters and regulation 
pension and post retirement benefit plans actuarial assumptions we and wolf creek calculate our pension benefit and post retirement medical benefit obligations and related costs using actuarial concepts within the guidance provided by applicable gaap 

table of contents in accounting for our retirement plans and post retirement benefits  we make assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
the reported costs of our pension plans are impacted by estimates regarding earnings on plan assets  contributions to the plan  discount rates used to determine our projected benefit obligation and pension costs  and employee demographics including age  compensation levels and employment periods 
changes in these assumptions result primarily in changes to regulatory assets  regulatory liabilities or the amount of related pension and post retirement benefit liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
such changes may also require cash contributions 
the following table shows the impact of a change in our pension plan discount rate  salary scale and rate of return on plan assets 
actuarial assumption change in assumption change in projected benefit obligation a annual change in projected pension costs a dollars in thousands discount rate decrease increase salary scale decrease increase rate of return on plan assets decrease increase a increases or decreases due to changes in actuarial assumptions result primarily in changes to regulatory assets and liabilities 
the following table shows the impact of a change in the discount rate and rate of return on plan assets and a change in the annual medical trend on our post retirement benefit plans 
actuarial assumption change in assumption change in projected benefit obligation a annual change in projected post retirement costs a dollars in thousands discount rate decrease increase rate of return on plan assets decrease increase annual medical trend decrease increase a increases or decreases due to changes in actuarial assumptions result primarily in changes to regulatory assets and liabilities 

table of contents income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
we recognize the future tax benefits to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
we amortize deferred investment tax credits over the lives of the related properties as required by tax laws and regulatory practices 
we recognize production tax credits in the year that electricity is generated to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
we record deferred tax assets to carry forward into future periods capital losses  operating losses and tax credits 
however  when we believe based on available evidence that we do not  or will not  have sufficient future capital gains or taxable income in the appropriate taxing jurisdiction to realize the entire benefit during the applicable carryforward period  we record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset 
the application of income tax law is complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and often ambiguous 
accordingly  we must make judgments regarding income tax exposure 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as a result  changes in our judgments can materially affect amounts we recognize in our consolidated financial statements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  taxes  for additional detail on our accounting for income taxes 
asset retirement obligations legal liability we have recognized legal obligations associated with the disposal of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development or normal operation of such assets 
concurrent with the recognition of the liability  the estimated cost of the asset retirement obligation aro is capitalized and depreciated over the remaining life of the asset 
we estimate our aros based on the fair value of the aros we incurred at the time the related long lived assets were either acquired  placed in service or when regulations establishing the obligation became effective 
we initially recorded aros at fair value for the estimated cost to decommission wolf creek our share  retire our wind generating facilities  dispose of asbestos insulating material at our power plants  remediate ash disposal ponds and dispose of polychlorinated biphenyl contaminated oil 
in determining our aros  we make assumptions regarding probable future disposal costs 
a change in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the aros reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december  and  we have recorded aros of million and million  respectively 
for additional information on our legal aros  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  asset retirement obligations 
non legal liability cost of removal we collect in our prices the costs to dispose of plant assets that do not represent legal retirement obligations 
as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in amounts collected  but not yet spent  for removal costs classified as a regulatory liability 
contingencies and litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and have estimated the probable cost for the resolution of these claims 
these estimates are based on an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
it is possible that our future consolidated financial results could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies and legal proceedings  for additional information 

table of contents operating results we evaluate operating results based on eps 
we have various classifications of revenues  defined as follows retail sales of electricity to residential  commercial and industrial customers 
classification of customers as residential  commercial or industrial requires judgment and our classifications may be different from other companies 
assignment of tariffs is not dependent on classification 
other retail sales of electricity for lighting public streets and highways  net of revenue subject to refund 
wholesale sales of electricity to electric cooperatives  municipalities and other electric utilities  the prices for which are either based on cost or prevailing market prices as prescribed by ferc authority 
margins realized from sales based on prevailing market prices generally serve to offset our retail prices and the prices charged to certain wholesale customers taking service under cost based tariffs 
transmission reflects transmission revenues  including those based on tariffs with the spp 
other miscellaneous electric revenues including ancillary service revenues and rent from electric property leased to others 
this category also includes energy marketing transactions unrelated to the production of our generating assets  changes in valuations of related contracts and fees we earn for marketing services that we provide for third parties 
electric utility revenues are impacted by things such as rate regulation  fuel costs  technology  customer behavior  the economy and competitive forces 
changing weather also affects the amount of electricity our customers use as electricity sales are seasonal 
as a summer peaking utility  the third quarter typically accounts for our greatest electricity sales 
hot summer temperatures and cold winter temperatures prompt more demand  especially among residential customers 
mild weather reduces customer demand 
our wholesale revenues are impacted by  among other factors  demand  cost and availability of fuel and purchased power  price volatility  available generation capacity  transmission availability and weather 

table of contents compared to below we discuss our operating results for the year ended december   compared to the results for the year ended december  significant changes in results of operations shown in the table immediately below are further explained in the descriptions that follow

table of contents rate case agreement in april  the kcc issued an order authorizing higher revenues to recover higher expenses primarily for increased tree trimming to enhance reliability and increased pension costs resulting from the consequences of the financial crisis and subsequent low interest rate environment in accordance with the regulatory mechanism in place to account for such pension costs 
as a result of this order  we expect selling  general and administrative expense to increase million and the cost of operating and maintaining our distribution system to increase million on an annualized basis 
in addition  we revised our depreciation rates to reflect changes in the estimated useful lives of some of our assets 
the change in estimate will decrease annual depreciation expense by million 
however  decreased depreciation expense as a result of lower depreciation rates will be offset by additions to property  plant and equipment 
because the aforementioned changes were implemented shortly after the kcc issued its order  our consolidated financial results do not reflect the full annual impact of the changes 
gross margin fuel and purchased power costs fluctuate with electricity sales and unit costs 
as permitted by regulators  we adjust our retail prices to reflect changes in the costs of fuel and purchased power 
fuel and purchased power costs for wholesale customers are recovered at prevailing market prices or based on a predetermined formula with a price adjustment approved by ferc 
as a result  changes in fuel and purchased power costs are offset in revenues with minimal impact on net income 
for this reason  we believe gross margin is useful for understanding and analyzing changes in our operating performance from one period to the next 
we calculate gross margin as total revenues less the sum of fuel and purchased power costs and spp network transmission costs 
transmission costs reflect the costs of providing network transmission service 
accordingly  in calculating gross margin  we recognize the net value of this transmission activity as shown in the table immediately following 
however  we record transmission costs as operating and maintenance expense on our consolidated statements of income 
the following table summarizes our gross margin for the years ended december  and year ended december  change change dollars in thousands revenues less fuel and purchased power expense spp network transmission costs gross margin the following table reflects changes in electricity sales for the years ended december  and no electricity sales are shown for transmission or other as they are not directly related to the amount of electricity we sell 
year ended december  change change thousands of mwh electricity sales residential commercial industrial a other retail total retail wholesale total a change less than 
gross margin increased due primarily to higher retail revenues that were the result of higher prices offset partially by lower retail electricity sales 
the lower retail electricity sales were attributable principally to moderate weather  which particularly impacted residential electricity sales 
in  cooling degree days were similar to  however  cooling degree days during the third quarter of were lower than the same period of 
table of contents income from operations is the most directly comparable measure gaap measure to our presentation of gross margin 
our presentation of gross margin should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations 
additionally  our presentation of gross margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
the following table reconciles income from operations with gross margin for the years ended december  and year ended december  change change dollars in thousands gross margin add spp network transmission costs less operating and maintenance expense depreciation and amortization expense selling  general and administrative expense income from operations operating expenses and other income and expense items year ended december  change change dollars in thousands operating and maintenance expense operating and maintenance expense increased due principally to higher spp network transmission costs of million  most of which is offset with higher revenues  a million increase in property taxes  most of which is offset in retail revenues  higher costs for tree trimming and other electrical system reliability activities of million  and higher costs at wolf creek of million  which were the result primarily of maintenance costs incurred during an unscheduled outage 
year ended december  change change dollars in thousands depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense decreased as a result of our having reduced depreciation rates to reflect changes in the estimated useful lives of some of our assets 
partially offsetting this decrease was additional depreciation expense associated primarily with additions at our power plants  including air quality controls  and the addition of transmission facilities 

table of contents year ended december  change change dollars in thousands selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense increased due primarily to our having reversed million of previously accrued liabilities in as a result of settling litigation  higher pension and other employee benefit costs of million  our having recorded million of expense as a result of sustainable cost reduction activities  and a million increase in the amortization of previously deferred amounts associated with various energy efficiency programs  which we recover in retail revenues  however  partially offsetting these increases was a million decrease in legal fees that was the result principally of arbitration and litigation that occurred in year ended december  change change dollars in thousands investment earnings investment earnings decreased due principally to our having recorded a million gain on the sale of a non utility investment in  however  partially offsetting these items was our having recorded million of additional gains on investments in a trust to fund retirement benefits and a million increase in our share of the earnings of the prairie wind transmission  llc 
year ended december  change change dollars in thousands other income other income increased due principally to our having recorded an additional million in coli benefits  a million increase in equity afudc  which reflects more construction activity  and our having recorded an additional million related to the sale of oil inventory 
year ended december  change change dollars in thousands income tax expense income tax expense increased due principally to higher income before income taxes

year ended december  change change thousands of mwh electricity sales residential commercial industrial other retail total retail wholesale total gross margin increased due primarily to higher total retail revenues  of which was due to higher prices and of which was due to higher electricity sales 
the increase in retail electricity sales was due principally to higher industrial electricity sales 
we believe improving economic conditions are why some of our industrial customers experienced increased production  which resulted in more electricity sales to them 
residential and commercial electricity sales increased due primarily to the effects of warmer weather 
as measured by cooling degree days  the weather in was warmer than in the following table reconciles income from operations with gross margin for the years ended december  and year ended december  change change dollars in thousands gross margin add spp network transmission costs less operating and maintenance expense depreciation and amortization expense selling  general and administrative expense income from operations 
table of contents operating expenses and other income and expense items year ended december  change change dollars in thousands operating and maintenance expense operating and maintenance expense increased due principally to higher spp network transmission costs of million  most of which is recovered in revenues  higher costs at wolf creek of million  which was the result primarily of an increase in the amortization of deferred refueling and maintenance outage costs of million and higher regulatory compliance costs  a million increase in property taxes  which was mostly offset in retail revenues  our having recorded in a million reduction in our liability for environmental remediation costs associated with assets we divested many years ago  a million increase related to the operation of our steam powered plants  and higher costs for tree trimming and other distribution reliability activities of million  however  partially offsetting these increases was an million decrease in the amortization of previously deferred storm costs 
year ended december  change change dollars in thousands depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased as a result of our having recorded additional depreciation expense associated primarily with the addition of transmission facilities and additions at our power plants  including air quality controls 
year ended december  change change dollars in thousands selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense decreased due primarily to the reversal of approximately million of previously accrued liabilities as a result of the legal settlements discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  legal proceedings  and our having recorded million less for non union  non executive employee compensation that is at risk to employees and payable only upon meeting pre established operating and financial objectives 
partially offsetting the aforementioned decreases was a million increase in the amortization of previously deferred amounts associated with various energy efficiency programs  which we recover in higher retail revenues  and higher legal fees of million related principally to the legal matters discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  legal proceedings 

table of contents year ended december  change change dollars in thousands investment earnings investment earnings increased due principally to our having recorded a million gain on the sale of a non utility investment 
this increase was offset partially by our having recorded lower gains on investments held in a trust to fund retirement benefits 
we recorded gains on these investments of million in compared to gains of million recorded in year ended december  change change dollars in thousands other income other income increased due principally to a million increase in equity afudc  which reflects increased construction activity  and our having recorded gains on the sale of oil of million  for which similar gains were not recorded in year ended december  change change dollars in thousands income tax expense income tax expense increased due principally to higher income before income taxes 
financial condition a number of factors affected amounts recorded on our balance sheet as of december   compared to december  as of december  change change dollars in thousands fuel inventory and supplies fuel inventory and supplies increased due principally to an million increase in supplies inventory and a million increase in coal inventory 
supplies inventory increased due principally to wolf creek preparation for the refueling and maintenance outage and as we construct environmental upgrades at jeffrey energy center 
as of december   coal volumes were lower due primarily to fewer coal deliveries as a result of flooding in coal inventories returned to more normal levels by december  as of december  change change dollars in thousands property  plant and equipment  net property  plant and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  increased due primarily to our installation of air quality controls at our power plants and expanding our transmission systems 

table of contents as of december  change change dollars in thousands regulatory assets regulatory liabilities net regulatory assets total regulatory assets decreased due primarily to the following reasons an million decrease in deferred employee benefit costs  a million decrease in amounts previously deferred for fuel expense  a million decrease in previously deferred storm costs  and a million decrease in amounts deferred for the wolf creek outage  however  partially offsetting decreases was a million increase in amounts deferred for property taxes 
regulatory liabilities increased due principally to a million increase in amounts collected but not yet spent to dispose of plant assets 
as of december  change change dollars in thousands short term debt short term debt increased due principally to increased issuances of commercial paper 
we used proceeds from issuances of short term debt securities to fund our capital and ongoing operating needs on an interim basis 
as of december  change change dollars in thousands long term debt  net long term debt  net increased due principally to the issuance of million principal amount of first mortgage bonds 
partially offsetting this increase was the redemption of million of bonds as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  long term debt 
as of december  change change dollars in thousands deferred income tax liabilities deferred income tax liabilities increased due primarily to our having recorded million of tax benefits resulting from the use of bonus and accelerated depreciation methods 
this was partially offset by a state tax credit carryforward benefit of million and the tax effect of a deferred net operating loss of million 

table of contents as of december  change change dollars in thousands unamortized investment tax credits unamortized investment tax credits increased due primarily to recording state investment tax credits of million in as of december  change change dollars in thousands accrued employee benefits accrued employee benefits decreased due primarily to our having contributed million to the westar energy pension trust  our having funded million of wolf creek pension plan contributions  and our having contributed million to westar energy post retirement benefit plan and all plans having had favorable returns on assets 
actuarial losses on all plans partially offset decreases 
liquidity and capital resources overview available sources of funds to operate our business include internally generated cash  short term borrowings under westar energy commercial paper program and revolving credit facilities  and access to capital markets 
we expect to meet our day to day cash requirements including  among other items  fuel and purchased power  dividends  interest payments  income taxes and pension contributions  using primarily internally generated cash and short term borrowings 
to meet the cash requirements for our capital investments  we expect to use internally generated cash  short term borrowings  and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities in the capital markets 
we also use proceeds from the issuance of securities to repay short term borrowings  which are principally related to investments in capital equipment and the redemption of bonds  when such balances are of sufficient size and it makes economic sense to do so  and for working capital and general corporate purposes 
for additional information on our future cash requirements  see future cash requirements below 
in  we expect to continue our significant capital spending program and plan to contribute to our pension trust

table of contents short term borrowings in westar energy entered into a commercial paper program pursuant to which it may issue commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any one time of billion 
this program is supported by westar energy revolving credit facilities described below 
maturities of commercial paper issuances may not exceed days from the date of issuance and proceeds from such issuances will be used to temporarily fund capital expenditures  to repay borrowings under westar energy revolving credit facilities  for working capital and or for other general corporate purposes 
as of february   westar energy had issued million of commercial paper 
westar energy has two revolving credit facilities in the amounts of million and million  which terminate in september and february  respectively 
as long as there is no default under the facilities  they may be extended up to an additional two years and one year  respectively  and the aggregate amount of borrowings under the facilities may be increased to billion and million  respectively  subject to lender participation 
all borrowings under the facilities are secured by kge first mortgage bonds 
total combined borrowings under the revolving credit facilities and the commercial paper program may not exceed billion at any given time 
as of february   no amounts were borrowed and million of letters of credit had been issued under the million facility 
no amounts were borrowed and no letters of credit were issued under the million facility as of the same date 
a default by westar energy or kge under other indebtedness totaling more than million would be a default under both revolving credit facilities

additionally  in march westar energy redeemed million aggregate principal amount of pollution control bonds and kge redeemed million aggregate principal amount of pollution control bonds 
the bonds were redeemed using short term debt 
as of december   we had million of variable rate  tax exempt bonds 
while the interest rates for these bonds have been extremely low  we continue to monitor the credit markets and evaluate our options with respect to these bonds 
the westar energy and kge mortgages each contain provisions restricting the amount of first mortgage bonds that can be issued by each entity 
we must comply with such restrictions prior to the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds or other secured indebtedness 
under the westar energy mortgage  the issuance of bonds is subject to limitations based on the amount of bondable property additions 
in addition  so long as any bonds issued prior to january   remain outstanding  the mortgage prohibits additional first mortgage bonds from being issued  except in connection with certain refundings  unless westar energy unconsolidated net earnings available for interest  depreciation and property retirement which as defined  does not include earnings or losses attributable to the ownership of securities of subsidiaries  for a period of consecutive months within months preceding the issuance  are not less than the greater of twice the annual interest charges on or of the principal amount of all first mortgage bonds outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance 
as of december   approximately million principal amount of additional first mortgage bonds could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage  except in connection with certain refundings 

table of contents under the kge mortgage  the issuance of bonds is subject to limitations based on the amount of bondable property additions 
in addition  the mortgage prohibits additional first mortgage bonds from being issued  except in connection with certain refundings  unless kge net earnings before income taxes and before provision for retirement and depreciation of property for a period of consecutive months within months preceding the issuance are not less than either two and one half times the annual interest charges on or of the principal amount of all kge first mortgage bonds outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance 
as of december   approximately million principal amount of additional kge first mortgage bonds could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage 
some of our debt instruments contain restrictions that require us to maintain leverage ratios as defined in the credit agreements 
we calculate these ratios in accordance with the agreements and they are used to determine compliance with our various debt covenants 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  impact of credit ratings on debt financing moody investors service moody  standard poor ratings services s p and fitch ratings fitch are independent credit rating agencies that rate our debt securities 
these ratings indicate each agency assessment of our ability to pay interest and principal when due on our securities 
in general  more favorable credit ratings increase borrowing opportunities and reduce the cost of borrowing 
under westar energy revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program  our cost of borrowings is determined in part by credit ratings 
however  westar energy ability to borrow under the credit facilities and commercial paper program are not conditioned on maintaining a particular credit rating 
we may enter into new credit agreements that contain credit rating conditions  which could affect our liquidity and or our borrowing costs 
factors that impact our credit ratings include a combination of objective and subjective criteria 
objective criteria include typical financial ratios  such as total debt to total capitalization and funds from operations to total debt  among others  future capital expenditures and our access to liquidity including committed lines of credit 
subjective criteria include such items as the quality and credibility of management  the political and regulatory environment we operate in and an assessment of our governance and risk management practices

partially offsetting these decreases was our having received approximately million more in customer receipts 
cash flows used in investing activities cash flows used in investing activities increased million from to and million from to due primarily to our having invested an additional million and million  respectively  in additions to property  plant and equipment  which was attributable principally to additions at our power plants  including air quality controls  and the addition of transmission facilities 
partially offsetting the increased investment in was our having received million more in proceeds from our investment in coli 
cash flows from used in financing activities cash flows from financing activities decreased million in compared to due primarily to our having received million less in proceeds from the issuance of common stock  which was attributable principally to our having issued shares in to settle forward sale transactions  and our having retired million more of long term debt due to favorable conditions in the capital markets

future cash requirements our business requires significant capital investments 
through  we expect to need cash primarily for utility construction programs designed to improve and expand facilities related to providing electric service  which include  but are not limited to  expenditures for environmental projects at our coal fired power plants  new transmission lines and other improvements to our power plants  transmission and distribution lines  and equipment 
we expect to meet these cash needs with internally generated cash  short term borrowings and the issuance of securities in the capital markets 
we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs to comply with existing and future environmental laws and regulations  which are subject to changing interpretations and amendments 
changes to environmental regulations could result in significantly more stringent laws and regulations or interpretations thereof that could affect us and our industry in particular 
these laws  regulations and interpretations could result in more stringent terms in our existing operating permits or a failure to obtain new permits could cause a material increase in our capital or operational costs and could otherwise have a material effect on our operations and consolidated financial results

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our fuel procurement and energy marketing activities involve primary market risk exposures  including commodity price risk  credit risk and interest rate risk 
commodity price risk is the potential adverse price impact related to the purchase or sale of electricity and energy related products 
credit risk is the potential adverse financial impact resulting from non performance by a counterparty of its contractual obligations 
interest rate risk is the potential adverse financial impact related to changes in interest rates 
in addition  our investments in trusts to fund nuclear plant decommissioning and to fund non qualified retirement benefits give rise to security price risk 
many of the securities in these trusts are exposed to price fluctuations in the capital markets 
commodity price risk we engage in both financial and physical trading with the goal of managing our commodity price risk  enhancing system reliability and increasing profits 
we procure and trade electricity  coal  natural gas and other energy related products by utilizing energy commodity contracts and a variety of financial instruments  including futures contracts  options and swaps 
within our energy trading portfolio  we may establish certain positions intended to economically hedge a portion of physical sale or purchase contracts and we may enter into certain positions attempting to take advantage of market trends and conditions 
we use the term economic hedge to mean a strategy intended to manage risks of volatility in prices or rate movements on selected assets  liabilities or anticipated transactions by creating a relationship in which gains or losses on derivative instruments are expected to offset the losses or gains on the assets  liabilities or anticipated transactions exposed to such market risks 
at the time we enter into these transactions  we are unable to determine the hedge value until the agreements are actually settled 
our future exposure to changes in prices will be dependent on the market prices and the extent and effectiveness of any economic hedging arrangements into which we enter 
additionally  net open positions exist  or are established  due to the origination of new transactions and our assessment of  and response to  changing market conditions 
to the extent we have net open positions  we are exposed to the risk that changing market prices could have a material impact on our consolidated financial results 
we use various types of fuel  including coal  natural gas  uranium and diesel to operate our plants and also purchase power to meet customer demand 
our prices and consolidated financial results are exposed to market risks from commodity price changes for electricity and other energy related products as well as from interest rates 
volatility in these markets impacts our costs of purchased power  costs of fuel for our generating plants and our participation in energy markets 
we strive to manage our customers and our exposure to these market risks through regulatory  operating and financing activities and  when we deem appropriate  we economically hedge a portion of these risks through the use of derivative financial instruments for non trading purposes 

table of contents factors that affect our commodity price exposure are the quantity and availability of fuel used for generation  the availability of our power plants and the quantity of electricity customers consume 
quantities of fossil fuel we use to generate electricity fluctuate from period to period based on availability  price and deliverability of a given fuel type  as well as planned and unscheduled outages at our generating plants that use fossil fuels 
our commodity price exposure is also affected by our nuclear plant refueling and maintenance schedule 
our customers electricity usage also varies based on weather  the economy and other factors 
we trade various types of fuel primarily to reduce exposure related to the volatility of commodity prices 
a significant portion of our coal requirements is purchased under long term contracts to hedge much of the fuel exposure for customers 
if we were unable to generate an adequate supply of electricity for our customers  we would purchase power in the wholesale market to the extent it is available  subject to possible transmission constraints  and or implement curtailment or interruption procedures as permitted in our tariffs and terms and conditions of service 
one way by which we manage and measure the commodity price risk of our trading portfolio is by using a variance covariance value at risk var model 
in addition to var  we employ additional risk control processes such as stress testing  daily loss limits  credit limits and position limits 
we expect to use similar control processes in the future 
the use of var requires assumptions  including the selection of a confidence level and a measure of volatility associated with potential losses and the estimated holding period 
we express var as a potential dollar loss based on a confidence level using a one day holding period and a day historical observation period 
it is possible that actual results may differ significantly from assumptions 
accordingly  var may not accurately reflect our levels of exposure 
the energy trading and market based wholesale portfolio var amounts for and were as follows in thousands high low average we have considered a variety of risks and costs associated with the future contractual commitments included in our trading portfolios 
these risks include valuation and marking of illiquid pricing locations and products  the financial condition of our counterparties and interest rate movement 
see the credit risk and interest rate risk discussions below for additional information 
also  there can be no assurance that the employment of var  credit practices or other risk management tools we employ will eliminate possible losses 
credit risk we are exposed to counterparty default risk with our retail  wholesale and energy marketing activities  including participation in rtos 
such credit risk is associated with the financial condition of counterparties  product location basis pricing differentials  physical liquidity constraints and other risks 
declines in the creditworthiness of our counterparties could have a material impact on our overall exposure to credit risk 
we maintain credit policies with regard to our counterparties intended to reduce our overall credit risk 
we also employ additional credit risk control mechanisms that we believe are appropriate  such as requiring counterparties to issue letters of credit or parental guarantees in our favor and entering into master netting agreements with counterparties that allow for offsetting exposures 
certain of our derivative instruments contain collateral provisions subject to certain of our debt ratings 
if such debt ratings were to decrease or fall below investment grade  the counterparties to the derivative instruments  pursuant to the provisions  could require collateralization on derivative instruments 
the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with objective credit risk related contingent features that were in a liability position as of december  and  was million and million  respectively  for which we had posted no collateral as of either date 
if all credit risk related contingent features underlying these agreements had been triggered as of december  and  we would have been required to provide to our counterparties million and million  respectively  of additional collateral after taking into consideration the offsetting impact of derivative assets and net accounts receivable 

table of contents interest rate risk we have entered into numerous fixed and variable rate debt obligations 
for details  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  long term debt 
we manage our interest rate risk related to these debt obligations by limiting our exposure to variable interest rate debt  diversifying maturity dates and entering into treasury yield hedge transactions 
we may also use other financial derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps 
we compute and present information about the sensitivity to changes in interest rates for variable rate debt and current maturities of fixed rate debt by assuming a basis point change in the current interest rates applicable to such debt over the remaining time the debt is outstanding 
we had approximately million of variable rate debt and current maturities of fixed rate debt as of december  a basis point change in interest rates applicable to this debt would impact income before income taxes on an annualized basis by approximately million 
as of december   we had million of variable rate bonds insured by bond insurers 
interest rates payable under these bonds are normally set through periodic auctions 
however  conditions in the credit markets over the past few years caused a dramatic reduction in the demand for auction bonds  which led to failed auctions 
the contractual provisions of these securities set forth an indexing formula method by which interest will be paid in the event of an auction failure 
depending on the level of these reference indices  our interest costs may be higher or lower than what they would have been had the securities been auctioned successfully 
additionally  should insurers of those bonds experience a decrease in their credit ratings  such event would most likely increase our borrowing costs 
furthermore  a decline in interest rates generally can serve to increase our pension and post retirement benefit obligations 
security price risk we maintain the ndt  as required by the nrc and kansas statute  to fund certain costs of nuclear plant decommissioning 
as of december   investments in the ndt were allocated to equity securities  to debt securities  to combination debt equity securities  to real estate securities and less than to cash equivalents 
as of december  and  the fair value of the ndt investments was million and million  respectively 
changes in interest rates and or other market changes resulting in a decrease in the value of the securities would have resulted in a million decrease in the value of the ndt as of december  we also maintain a trust to fund non qualified retirement benefits 
as of december   investments in the trust were comprised of equity securities  debt securities and less than cash equivalents 
the fair value of the investments in this trust was million as of december   and million as of december  changes in interest rates and or other market changes resulting in a decrease in the value of the securities would have resulted in a million decrease in the value of the trust as of december  by maintaining diversified portfolios of securities  we seek to maximize the returns to fund the aforementioned obligations within acceptable risk tolerances  including interest rate risk 
however  many of the securities in the portfolios are exposed to price fluctuations in the capital markets 
if the value of the securities diminishes  the cost of funding the obligations rises 
we actively monitor the portfolios by benchmarking the performance of the investments against relevant indices and by maintaining and periodically reviewing the asset allocations in relation to established policy targets 
our exposure to security price risk related to the ndt is in part mitigated because we are currently allowed to recover decommissioning costs in the prices we charge our customers
