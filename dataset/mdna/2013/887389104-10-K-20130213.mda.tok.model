at december   the company had no outstanding borrowings under the asset securitization agreement  however  certain borrowing base limitations reduced the availability under the asset securitization agreement to million 
the company has a million senior credit facility that matures on may  at december   the company had no outstanding borrowings under the senior credit facility but had letters of credit outstanding totaling million  which reduced the availability under the senior credit facility to million 
under the senior credit facility  the company has two financial covenants a consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio 
at december   the company was in full compliance with the covenants under the senior credit facility 
the maximum consolidated leverage ratio permitted under the senior credit facility is to as of december   the company s consolidated leverage ratio was to the minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio permitted under the senior credit facility is to as of december   the company s consolidated interest coverage ratio was to 
table of contents the interest rate under the senior credit facility is based on the company s consolidated leverage ratio 
in addition  the company pays a facility fee based on the consolidated leverage ratio multiplied by the aggregate commitments of all of the lenders under the senior credit facility 
other sources of liquidity include short term and long term lines of credit for certain of the company s foreign subsidiaries  which provide for borrowings up to million in the aggregate 
the majority of these lines are uncommitted 
at december   the company had borrowings outstanding of million  which reduced the availability under these facilities to million 
the company expects that any cash requirements in excess of cash on hand will be met by the committed funds available under its asset securitization agreement and the senior credit facility 
management believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations through at least the term of the senior credit facility 
at december   approximately million  or  of the company s cash and cash equivalents resided in jurisdictions outside the united states 
repatriation of these funds to the united states could be subject to domestic and foreign taxes and an immaterial amount could be subject to governmental restrictions 
part of the company s strategy is to grow in attractive market sectors  many of which are outside the united states 
this strategy may include making investments in facilities and equipment and potential new acquisitions 
the company plans to fund these investments  as well as meet working capital requirements  with cash and cash equivalents and unused lines of credit within the geographic location of these investments when possible 
the company expects to remain in compliance with its debt covenants 
however  the company may need to limit its borrowings under the senior credit facility or other facilities in order to remain in compliance 
as of december   the company could have borrowed the full amounts available under the senior credit facility and asset securitization agreement  and would have still been in compliance with its debt covenants 
the company expects cash from operations in to decrease to approximately million from million in as the company anticipates lower net income and an increase in working capital partially offset by lower pension and postretirement contributions 
the company expects to make approximately million in pension and postretirement contributions in  compared to million in the company also expects to increase capital expenditures to approximately million in compared to million in contractual obligations the company s contractual debt obligations and contractual commitments outstanding as of december  were as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years interest payments long term debt  including current portion short term debt operating leases purchase commitments retirement benefits total the interest payments beyond five years primarily relate to medium term notes that mature over the next years 
purchase commitments are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company 
included in purchase commitments above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts  capital commitments  service agreements and utilities 
many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts  in which the company guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services 
these purchase commitments do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future  but represent only those items for which the company is contractually obligated 
the majority of the company products and services are purchased as needed  with no commitment 

table of contents retirement benefits represent pension and health care payments expected to be paid to retirees or their beneficiaries over the next ten years 
these payments are largely covered by pension and postretirement benefit plan assets 
as of december   the company had approximately million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits 
the company anticipates a decrease in its unrecognized tax positions of million to million during the next months 
the anticipated decrease is primarily due to settlements with tax authorities 
future tax positions are not known at this time and therefore not included in the above summary of the company s fixed contractual obligations 
refer to note income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
during  the company made cash contributions of approximately million to its global defined benefit pension plans  of which million was discretionary 
the company also contributed million to a veba trust to fund retiree health care costs 
the company currently expects to make contributions to its global defined benefit pension plans totaling approximately million in  of which million is discretionary 
the company also currently expects to make contributions to a veba trust to fund retiree health care costs totaling million in the company may consider making additional discretionary contributions to either its global defined benefit pension plans or its postretirement benefit plans during returns for the company s global defined benefit pension plan assets in were  above the expected rate of return of due to broad increases in global equity markets 
the higher returns positively impacted the funded status of the plans at the end of and are expected to result in lower pension expense in future years 
however  pension expense will increase due to the reduction in the discount rate in compared to refer to note retirement benefit plans and note postretirement benefit plans in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
during  the company purchased million of its common shares for approximately million in the aggregate under the company common stock purchase plan 
this plan authorizes the company to buy  in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  up to million shares of common stock  which are to be held as treasury shares and used for specified purposes 
the authorization expires on december  as disclosed in note contingencies and note income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company has exposure for certain legal and tax matters 
the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons 
recently adopted accounting pronouncments information required for this item is incorporated by reference to note significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the following paragraphs include a discussion of some critical areas that require a higher degree of judgment  estimates and complexity 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when title passes to the customer 
this occurs at the shipping point except for goods sold by certain foreign entities and certain exported goods  where title passes when the goods reach their destination 
selling prices are fixed based on purchase orders or contractual arrangements 
shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in net sales and the related costs are included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of income 
in july  the company acquired the assets of gears and services 
gears and services recognizes a portion of its revenues on the percentage of completion method 
in  the company recognized approximately million in net sales under the percentage of completion method 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  with approximately valued by the lifo method and the remaining valued by the first in  first out fifo method 
the majority of the company s domestic inventories are valued by the lifo method  and all of the company s international inventories are valued by the fifo method 
an actual valuation of the inventory under the lifo method can be made only at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time 
accordingly  interim lifo calculations are based on management s estimates of expected year end inventory levels and costs 
because these are subject to many factors beyond management s control  annual results may differ from interim results as they are subject to the final year end lifo inventory valuation 
the company recognized a decrease in its lifo reserve of million for  compared to an increase in its lifo reserve of million for goodwill the company tests goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually 
the company performs its annual impairment test on october first after the annual forecasting process is completed 
furthermore  goodwill is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
each interim period  management of the company assesses whether or not an indicator of impairment is present that would necessitate that a goodwill impairment analysis be performed in an interim period other than during the fourth quarter 
the goodwill impairment analysis is a two step process 
step one compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value 
to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  step two is performed  where the reporting unit s carrying value of goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of goodwill 
to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  impairment exists and must be recognized 
the company reviews goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
prior to  the company s reporting units were the same as its reportable segments mobile industries  process industries  aerospace and defense and steel 
during  management began reviewing goodwill for impairment at a level below the segment level for the process industries and aerospace and defense segments 
this change was necessitated by a change in management structure  as well as the level of review of financial information by management within the aerospace and defense segment  and the acquisition of the assets of gears and services 
gears and services is part of the process industries segment and provides aftermarket gear box repair services and gear drive systems for the industrial  energy and military marine market sectors 
the company still reviews goodwill for impairment at the segment level for the mobile industries and steel segments 

table of contents during  the company adopted the provisions of accounting standards update asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment  which allows companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
based on a review of various qualitative factors  management concluded that the goodwill for the mobile industries  process industries and steel segments  as well as the gears and services reporting unit  was not impaired and that the two step approach was not required to be performed for these reporting units 
based on a review of various qualitative factors  management concluded that the goodwill for the reporting units within the aerospace and defense segment would be tested under the two step approach 
the company prepares its goodwill impairment analysis by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit  using an income approach a discounted cash flow model  as well as a market approach  with its carrying value 
the income approach requires several assumptions including future sales growth  ebit earnings before interest and taxes margins and capital expenditures 
the company s reporting units each provide their forecast of results for the next three years 
these forecasts are the basis for the information used in the discounted cash flow model 
the discounted cash flow model also requires the use of a discount rate and a terminal revenue growth rate the revenue growth rate for the period beyond the three years forecasted by the reporting units  as well as projections of future operating margins for the period beyond the forecasted three years 
during the fourth quarter of  the company used a discount rate for its aerospace and defense reporting units of to and a terminal revenue growth rate of 
the market approach requires several assumptions including ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization multiples for comparable companies that operate in the same markets as the company s reporting units 
during the fourth quarter of  the company used ebitda multiples of to for its aerospace and defense reporting units 
as of december   the company had million of goodwill on its consolidated balance sheet  of which million was attributable to the aerospace and defense segment 
see note goodwill and other intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the carrying amount of goodwill by segment 
the fair value of the aerospace and defense segment three reporting units was million  million and million  respectively  compared to their carrying value of million  million and million  respectively 
as a result  the company did not recognize any goodwill impairment charges for the year ended december  a basis point increase in the discount rate would have resulted in one of the aerospace and defense segment reporting units failing step one of the goodwill impairment analysis  which would have required the completion of step two of the goodwill impairment analysis to arrive at a potential goodwill impairment loss 
the projected cash flows could decline by as much as and the reporting units fair value would still exceed their carrying value 
in  the income approach for the reporting units within the aerospace and defense segment was weighted by and the market approach was weighted by in arriving at fair value 
the weighting was selected to give consideration for the fact that the metrics for the last twelve months for the reporting units within the aerospace and defense segment were not reflective of expected performance and the discounted cash flow model provided a more normalized view of future operating conditions for the aerospace and defense segment 
had the company used a weighting  the company would still have passed step one of the goodwill impairment test for each of the reporting units within the aerospace and defense segment for the year ended december  during  the company adopted the provisions of accounting standards update asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangibles for impairment  which allows companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if indefinite lived intangibles might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two step impairment test 
based on a review of various qualitative factors  management concluded that the company indefinite lived intangible assets were not impaired and that the two step approach was not required to be performed for these reporting units 

table of contents restructuring costs the company s policy is to recognize restructuring costs in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  exit or disposal cost obligations  and asc  compensation and non retirement post employment benefits 
detailed contemporaneous documentation is maintained and updated to ensure that accruals are properly supported 
if management determines that there is a change in estimate  the accruals are adjusted to reflect this change 
income taxes the company  which is subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous non us jurisdictions  accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the company records valuation allowances against deferred tax assets by tax jurisdiction when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
in determining the need for a valuation allowance  the historical and projected financial performance of the entity recording the net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information 
net deferred tax assets relate primarily to pension and postretirement benefit obligations in the united states  which the company believes are more likely than not to result in future tax benefits 
in the ordinary course of the company s business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate income tax determination is uncertain 
the company is regularly under audit by tax authorities 
accruals for uncertain tax positions are provided for in accordance with the requirements of asc the company records interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  and accruals for uncertain tax positions 

table of contents benefit plans the company sponsors a number of defined benefit pension plans that cover eligible associates 
the company also sponsors several funded and unfunded postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees and their dependents 
these plans are accounted for in accordance with asc  defined benefit plans pension and asc  defined benefit plans other postretirement 
the measurement of liabilities related to these plans is based on management assumptions related to future events  including discount rates  rates of return on pension plan assets  rates of compensation increases and health care cost trend rates 
management regularly evaluates these assumptions and adjusts them as required and appropriate 
other plan assumptions are also reviewed on a regular basis to reflect recent experience and the company future expectations 
actual experience that differs from these assumptions may affect future liquidity  expense and the overall financial position of the company 
while the company believes that current assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the company pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations and its future expense and cash flow 
the discount rate is used to calculate the present value of expected future pension and postretirement cash flows as of the measurement date 
the company establishes the discount rate by constructing a notional portfolio of high quality corporate bonds and matching the coupon payments and bond maturities to projected benefit payments under the company pension and postretirement welfare plans 
the bonds included in the portfolio are generally non callable 
a lower discount rate will result in a higher benefit obligation  conversely  a higher discount rate will result in a lower benefit obligation 
the discount rate is also used to calculate the annual interest cost  which is a component of net periodic benefit cost 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by analyzing the historical long term performance of the company pension plan assets  as well as the mix of plan assets between equities  fixed income securities and other investments  the expected long term rate of return expected for those asset classes and long term inflation rates 
short term asset performance can differ significantly from the expected rate of return  especially in volatile markets 
a lower than expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense and future contributions 
defined benefit pension plans the company recognized net periodic benefit cost of million in for defined benefit pension plans  compared to million in the increase in expense was primarily due to higher amortization of net actuarial losses and costs related to the curtailment of pension benefit plans  partially offset by lower interest cost and higher expected return from plan assets 
amortization of net actuarial losses was million in  compared to million in the higher amortization of net actuarial losses was primarily due to a basis point reduction in the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit pension obligation of at december  compared to a discount rate of at december  in addition  the increase in amortization of actuarial losses was due to the migration of deferred asset losses from and into unrecognized losses subject to amortization 
net actuarial losses are amortized over the average remaining service period of participants in the defined benefit pension plans 
costs related to the curtailment of pension benefit plans were million and primarily related to the closure of the manufacturing facility in st

during the period between december  and december   the company recognized net actuarial losses totaling  million for defined benefit pension plans 
these actuarial losses primarily occurred in  and  offset slightly by gains in and in  the net actuarial loss of million for defined benefit pension plans was primarily due to the global financial crisis  which led to broad declines in pension investment returns a net asset loss of million on actual assets in  or negative on pension plan assets of billion  compared to an expected return of million  or  in 
the remaining portion of the net actuarial loss for was due to other changes in actuarial assumptions 
in  the net actuarial loss of million was primarily due to a basis point reduction in the company discount rate used to measure its defined benefit pension obligation

despite the net actuarial losses recorded for the period between december  and december   only approximately million of contributions are required in the effect of actuarial losses on future earnings and operating cash flow is expected to be largely neutral as the favorable impact of discretionary pension contributions offsets the increase in pension expense attributable to the amortization of actuarial losses

defined benefit pension plans in the united states represent of the company benefit obligation and of the fair value of the company plan assets at december  the company uses a combined us federal and state statutory rate of approximately to calculate the after tax impact on equity for us plans 
the company uses the local statutory tax rate in effect to calculate the after tax impact on equity for all remaining non us plans 
for some non us plans  a valuation allowance has been recorded against the tax benefits recorded in equity and  therefore  no tax benefits are recognized on an after tax basis 
postretirement benefit plans the company recognized net periodic benefit cost of million in for postretirement benefit plans  compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to higher expected returns from plan assets for postretirement benefit plans and lower interest cost 
in  the company included an expected return from plan assets of million in net periodic benefit cost  compared to an expected return from plan assets of million in at the end of  the company established a veba trust for certain bargaining unit employees retiree medical benefits

the change in total equity in the table above is reflected on a pre tax basis 
for measurement purposes for postretirement benefits  the company assumed a weighted average annual rate of increase in per capita cost health care cost trend rate for medical and prescription drug benefits of for  declining steadily for the next years to  and for hmo benefits for  declining gradually for the next years to 
the assumed health care cost trend rate may have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have increased the total service and interest cost components by million and would have increased the postretirement obligation by million 
a one percentage point decrease would provide corresponding reductions of million and million  respectively 
other loss reserves the company has a number of loss exposures that are incurred in the ordinary course of business such as environmental claims  product liability  product warranty  litigation and accounts receivable reserves 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires management s estimate and judgment with regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability or realization 
these loss reserves are reviewed periodically and adjustments are made to reflect the most recent facts and circumstances

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk changes in short term interest rates related to several separate funding sources impact the company s earnings 
these sources are borrowings under an asset securitization agreement  borrowings under the senior credit facility  floating rate tax exempt us municipal bonds with a weekly reset and short term bank borrowings by its international subsidiaries 
if the market rates for short term borrowings increased by one percentage point around the globe  the impact would be an increase in interest expense of million annually  with a corresponding decrease in income from continuing operations before income taxes of the same amount 
this amount was determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company s borrowing cost  year end debt balances by category and an estimated impact on the tax exempt municipal bonds interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk fluctuations in the value of the us dollar compared to foreign currencies  including the euro  also impact the company s earnings 
the greatest risk relates to products shipped between the company s european operations and the united states 
foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge a portion of these intercompany transactions 
additionally  hedges are used to cover third party purchases of product and equipment 
as of december   there were million of hedges in place 
a uniform weakening of the us dollar against all currencies would have resulted in a charge of million related to these hedges  which would have partially offset the otherwise favorable impact of the underlying currency fluctuation 
in addition to the direct impact of the hedged amounts  changes in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
commodity price risk in the ordinary course of business  the company is exposed to market risk with respect to commodity price fluctuations  primarily related to our purchases of raw materials and energy  principally scrap steel  other ferrous and non ferrous metals  alloys and natural gas 
whenever possible  the company manages its exposure to commodity risks primarily through the use of supplier pricing agreements that enable the company to establish the purchase prices for certain inputs that are used in our manufacturing and distribution business 
timken utilizes a raw material surcharge as a component of pricing steel to pass through the cost increases of scrap steel and other raw materials  as well as natural gas 
from time to time  the company also uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of its exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases
