item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview idenix pharmaceuticals  inc  which we refer to together with our wholly owned subsidiaries as idenix  we  us or our  is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of drugs for the treatment of human viral diseases with operations in the united states and europe 
currently  our primary research and development focus is on the treatment of patients with hepatitis c virus  or hcv 
our hcv discovery program is focused on nucleoside nucleotide polymerase inhibitors and nsa inhibitors 
our strategic goal is to develop all oral combinations of direct acting antiviral  or daa  drug candidates that should eliminate the need for interferon and or ribavirin with the current treatment for hcv 
our objective is to develop low dose  once or twice daily agents with broad genotypic activity that have low potential for drug drug interaction  high tolerability and are designed for use in multiple combination regimens 
we are seeking to build a combination development strategy  both internally and with partners  to advance the future of hcv treatments 
we believe that nucleotides will have a significant role in a combination daa strategy for the treatment of hcv and therefore we are currently concentrating a substantial amount of our discovery efforts on this class of drugs 
we believe we have strong nucleotide scientific expertise within our organization and should be able to leverage our intellectual patent portfolio to develop additional novel nucleotide drug candidates 
the following table summarizes key information regarding our pipeline of hcv drug candidates as well as telbivudine tyzeka sebivo indication product drug candidates programs description hcv nucleotide polymerase inhibitor idx in september  the us food and drug administration  or fda  placed two of our hcv drug candidates  idx and our protease inhibitor  idx  on clinical hold 
the hold was imposed following a day drug drug interaction study of a combination of idx and idx in healthy volunteers 
we believe hepatoxicity observed in this drug drug interaction study was caused by idx and therefore discontinued the clinical development of idx in february  the full clinical hold on idx was removed 
in july of  we initiated the phase ii clinical trial of idx in treatment na ve hcv genotype infected patients under a partial clinical hold 
we provided an interim analysis of the first patients following days of treatment to the fda and in february  the partial clinical hold was removed 
we completed enrollment in may with a total of patients and we reported rates of rapid virologic response rvr  virus levels iu ml at weeks of in the mg arm and in the mg arm 
rates of complete early virologic response cevr  virus levels iu ml at weeks were in the mg arm and in the mg arm 
no patient experienced virologic breakthrough during the week idx and pegylated interferon and ribavirin  or peg ifn rbv  treatment period 
the majority of patients are in the ongoing peg ifn rbv extension treatment phase 
in august  the fda placed idx on partial clinical hold due to serious cardiac related adverse events observed with a competitor s nucleotide polymerase inhibitor  bms in previous clinical trials as well as in our ongoing phase ii clinical trial of idx in combination with peg ifn rbv  we have 
table of contents indication product drug candidates programs description observed no evidence of severe cardiac findings to date 
in december  we submitted a response package to the fda and in february  the fda communicated to us that this program will remain on clinical hold due to unresolved concerns regarding the potential for cardiac toxicity 
as a result  we elected not to continue the development of idx nucleotide polymerase inhibitor idx in july  we submitted an investigational new drug application  or ind  for idx  our lead candidate for a nucleotide polymerase inhibitor drug candidate 
in august  the fda placed idx on clinical hold due to serious cardiac related adverse events observed with a competitor s nucleotide polymerase inhibitor  bms no patients have been dosed with idx in order to respond to the fda s concerns with respect to idx  we conducted additional preclinical toxicology and metabolic studies 
in february  the fda communicated to us that this program will remain on clinical hold due to unresolved concerns regarding the potential for cardiac toxicity 
as a result  we elected not to continue the development of idx nucleotide polymerase inhibitor discovery program as part of the ongoing extensive nucleotide discovery effort  we are exploring a diverse spectrum of nucleotides with novel bases  prodrugs and sugar moieties 
ind enabling studies have begun for a new uridine nucleotide prodrug and an ind is expected to be filed in the first half of we also anticipate conducting ind enabling studies for additional nucleotide prodrugs in nsa inhibitors idx in january  we initiated a phase i clinical study of idx the first part of the study evaluated the safety  pharmacokinetics and food effect of idx in healthy volunteers at single doses ranging from mg to mg 
eight healthy volunteers received mg of idx daily for seven days 
all doses were well tolerated and pharmacokinetic data supports once daily dosing in future studies 
in the second quarter of  we completed the second part of the phase i study  single ascending doses of idx in hcv genotype  and infected patients 
idx was well tolerated and demonstrated potent pan genotypic antiviral activity with more than log 
viral load reductions achieved in the mg dose group 
in june  we also completed a three day proof of concept study designed to evaluate treatment na ve hcv genotype   or infected patients 
hcv genotype patients were randomized to receive placebo  mg qd once daily  mg qd  mg bid twice daily or mg qd for three days 
hcv genotype  and patients were randomized to receive placebo  mg bid or mg qd for three days 
idx was well tolerated with no treatment emergent serious adverse events reported 
treatment with idx exhibited potent pan genotypic activity across genotypes in genotype a patients n  mean maximal viral load reductions ranged from log 
iu ml to log 
iu ml across treatment groups  
table of contents indication product drug candidates programs description in genotype b patients n  mean maximal viral load reductions were log 
iu ml in the mg qd arm  and log 
iu ml in the mg qd arm  in genotype patients n  the mean maximal viral load reduction was log 
iu ml in both the mg bid and mg qd arms with a greater variability in responses among these patients range log 
iu ml 
four of the genotype patients responded well to idx treatment  and four patients had maximal reductions that were less than log 
iu ml 
the decrease in viral load response in genotype patients was associated with the pre existence or emergence of the m polymorphism in the hcv nsa gene  in genotype patients n  mean maximal viral load reductions were log iu ml in the mg bid arm and log iu ml in the mg qd arm  and in genotype patients n  mean maximal viral load reductions were log 
iu ml in the mg bid arm and log 
iu ml in the mg qd arm 
in july  the fda granted fast track designation for idx with a fast track designation  there is an opportunity for more frequent interactions with the fda and the possibility of a priority review  which would reduce the length of the standard fda review period leading to commercialization 
we expect to initiate a drug drug interaction study evaluating idx and simeprevir tmc in the first quarter of followed by phase ii studies with janssen pharmaceuticals  inc  or janssen  through a non exclusive collaboration 
refer to the janssen phamaceuticals  inc collaboration heading below for further details 
hbv tyzeka sebivo telbivudine l nucleoside novartis pharma ag  or novartis  had worldwide development  commercialization and manufacturing rights and obligations related to tyzeka sebivo 
prior to august  we received royalty payments equal to a percentage of net sales of tyzeka sebivo 
refer to the novartis collaboration heading below for details on the modification of the collaboration and the tyzeka sebivo royalties 
in august  the fda placed idx on partial clinical hold and idx on clinical hold due to serious cardiac related adverse events observed with a competitor s nucleotide polymerase inhibitor  bms these three compounds are guanosine based nucleotide polymerase inhibitors 
in order to respond to the fda s concerns with respect to idx  we reviewed multiple cardiac safety measurements  in vitro cytotoxity studies and in vivo animal studies using idx in order to respond to the fda s concerns with respect to idx  we conducted additional preclinical toxicology and metabolic studies 
in december  we submitted a response package to the fda related to the partial clinical hold on idx and in february  the 
table of contents fda communicated to us that both of these programs will remain on clinical hold due to unresolved concerns regarding the potential for cardiac toxicity 
as a result  we elected not to continue the development of these two programs 
we have agreed to two additional cardiac safety visits for the patients in the idx phase ii study at six months and months following the echocardiograms we obtained when the clinical hold was initiated 
we intend to devote our resources to the development of idx and the discovery and development of additional novel nucleotide prodrugs 
all of our drug candidates are currently in preclinical or early clinical development 
to commercialize any of our drug candidates  we will be required to obtain marketing authorization approvals after successfully completing preclinical studies and clinical trials of such drug candidates 
we anticipate that we will incur significant additional third party research and development expenses that range from million to million for each drug candidate prior to commercial launch 
our current estimates of additional third party research and development expenses do not include the cost of phase iiib iv clinical trials and other clinical trials that are not required for regulatory approval 
we use our employees and our infrastructure resources across several projects  including our product discovery efforts 
we do not allocate our infrastructure costs on a project by project basis 
as a result  we are unable to estimate the internal costs incurred to date for our drug candidates on a project by project basis 
set forth below were the third party research and development expenses incurred in connection with our significant preclinical studies and clinical trials disease indication years ended december  product drug candidate in thousands hcv nucleotide polymerase inhibitors   hcv nsa inhibitor   hcv preclinical discovery program and other  hcv non nucleoside polymerase inhibitor  hcv protease inhibitors  hcv combination drug drug interaction study hiv non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor as shown in the table above  in our focus continued to be on the development of our nucleotide polymerase inhibitors program  which primarily included completing enrollment of the idx phase ii clinical trial and ind enabling studies for idx during  we also completed a phase i and proof of concept study for our nsa inhibitor  idx in  we elected not to devote significant resources to our non nucleoside and protease inhibitor programs and have reallocated these resources to the discovery and development of additional nucleotide polymerase inhibitors 
we have incurred significant losses each year since our inception in may and at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
historically  we have generated losses principally from costs associated with research and development activities  including clinical trial costs  and general and administrative activities 
as a result of planned expenditures for future discovery and development activities  we expect to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to sustain operations into at least the second half of janssen pharmaceuticals  inc collaboration on january   we entered into a non exclusive collaboration agreement with janssen for the clinical evaluation of all oral direct daa hcv combination therapies 
the combination therapies involve idx  our 
table of contents once daily pan genotypic nsa inhibitor  simeprevir tmc  a once daily protease inhibitor jointly developed by janssen and medivir ab  or medivir  and tmc  a once daily non nucleoside polymerase inhibitor  boosted with low dose ritonavir  being developed by janssen 
under the terms of this collaboration agreement  we will conduct the clinical trials 
clinical development plans include drug drug interaction studies  followed by phase ii studies as agreed between the companies  pending approval from regulatory authorities 
the phase ii program is expected to first evaluate the two daa combination of idx and simeprevir tmc plus ribavirin in treatment na ve hcv infected patients 
subsequently  the companies plan to evaluate a three daa combination of idx  simeprevir tmc  tmc with low dose ritonavir  with and without ribavirin  in a broader group of hcv infected patients 
the clinical trials will be conducted under an arrangement whereby janssen provides us with clinical supply of simeprevir tmc and tmc at no cost 
neither party will receive any milestone or royalty payments from the other party under this agreement 
both companies retain all rights to their respective compounds under this agreement 
the parties have no obligation to conduct additional clinical trials beyond those described here 
neither party has licensed any commercial rights to the other party 
this collaboration agreement may be terminated by either party in certain circumstances 
this collaboration agreement will terminate if the parties do not agree to proceed with a two daa combination clinical trial of idx and simeprevir tmc plus ribavirin in treatment na ve hcv infected patients within a certain period of time following the drug drug interaction study involving these two compounds 
janssen may terminate the collaboration agreement  in its sole discretion  by providing us with days written notice 
if janssen terminates the collaboration agreement in such instance  it shall reimburse us for certain of our costs associated with the collaboration 
janssen may also terminate the collaboration agreement if we fail to meet certain formulation requirements 
if either us or janssen materially breaches the collaboration agreement and does not cure such breach within a specified time period  the non breaching party may terminate the collaboration agreement in its entirety 
either party may also terminate the collaboration agreement  effective immediately  if the other party files for bankruptcy  is dissolved or has a receiver appointed for substantially all of its property 
either party may also terminate the collaboration agreement to protect the safety  health or welfare of subjects in the trials 
we may terminate the collaboration agreement prior to the commencement of certain activities if janssen s research development and license agreement with medivir is terminated 
novartis collaboration in may  we entered into a collaboration with novartis relating to the worldwide development and commercialization of our drug candidates  which we refer to as the development and commercialization agreement 
in may  we also entered into a stockholders agreement with novartis  which we refer to as the stockholders agreement 
on july   we and novartis materially modified our collaboration by executing a termination and revised relationship agreement  which we refer to as the termination agreement  and by amending the stockholders agreement  which we refer to as the second amended and restated stockholders agreement 
under the development and commercialization agreement  novartis had an option to license any of our development stage drug candidates after demonstration of activity and safety in a proof of concept clinical trial so long as novartis maintained at least ownership of our voting stock 
pursuant to the termination agreement executed in july  novartis option right to license our current and future development stage drug candidates in any therapeutic area was terminated 
in exchange  we have agreed to pay novartis a royalty based on worldwide product sales of our hcv drug products  unless such drug products are prescribed in combination with novartis hcv drug products 
the royalty percentage will vary based on our commercialized hcv drug product and range from the high single digits to the low double digit percentages 
royalties are payable until the 
table of contents later to occur of a expiration of the last to expire of specified patent rights in a country  or b ten years after the first commercial sale of a product in such country  provided that if royalties are payable on a product after the expiration of the patent rights in a country  each of the respective royalty rates for such product in such country would be reduced by one half 
pursuant to the termination agreement  we granted novartis a non exclusive license to conduct clinical trials evaluating a combination of any of our and novartis hcv drug candidates after the hcv drug candidates have completed dose ranging studies  subject to meeting certain criteria 
under certain circumstances novartis may conduct a dose ranging study with respect to our hcv drug candidates 
with respect to any combination trial  certain criteria must first be met prior to the commencement of such combination clinical trial 
if the parties cannot agree to the initiation of a combination trial  an independent data safety monitoring board will determine whether or not the combination trial should be initiated based on the safety profile of each hcv drug candidate 
we have agreed to supply novartis with our hcv drug candidates for use in such combination trials 
we and novartis have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to  in good faith  enter into a supply agreement and other relevant agreements in connection with any such combination trial 
novartis ability to initiate combination trials expires on the seven year anniversary of the execution of the termination agreement  or july  although any then existing combination study commenced prior to such expiration date may continue after the expiration date 
prior to the execution of the termination agreement  the balance of deferred revenue  related party was million 
since neither vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  or third party evidence  or tpe  for the non exclusive license deliverable was available  we determined the best estimate of selling price  or besp  of the non exclusive license at july  to be million 
we recognized the excess deferred revenue over the besp  or million  as collaborative revenue related party in the three months ended september  the remaining deferred revenue of million is being recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the non exclusive license  or seven years 
during the year ended december   we recognized million of collaboration revenue related to the non exclusive license and as of december   we had a balance of million of deferred revenue  related party in our consolidated balance sheet 
under the termination agreement  following the receipt of certain data related to a combination trial and upon novartis request  we and novartis are obligated to use  in good faith  commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate a future agreement for the development  manufacture and commercialization of such combination therapy for the treatment of hcv 
any future arrangement may set forth any co promotion and co marketing rights we may retain and any net benefit to us and novartis attributable to such rights 
neither party is obligated to negotiate for a period longer than days 
under the termination agreement  novartis has a non exclusive license to conduct clinical trials evaluating a combination of any of our hcv drug candidates and any of novartis hcv drug candidates after certain criteria have been met 
if novartis obtains regulatory approval to co label a novartis hcv drug product with one or more of our hcv drug products  novartis could market and sell a combination that may compete with our drug candidates and or combination products that we market and sell in the future 
in  under the development and commercialization agreement  novartis licensed tyzeka sebivo from us for the treatment of hepatitis b virus  or hbv 
in september  we and novartis entered into an amendment to the development and commercialization agreement pursuant to which we transferred to novartis worldwide development  commercialization and manufacturing rights and obligations pertaining to tyzeka sebivo 
subsequently  we began receiving royalty payments equal to a percentage of net sales of tyzeka sebivo through july   the date of the termination agreement 
subsequent to july  we no longer receive royalty or milestone payments from novartis based upon worldwide product sales of tyzeka sebivo for the treatment of hbv 
novartis is committed to reimburse us for our contractual payments to third parties in connection with intellectual property related to tyzeka sebivo 
we will otherwise be responsible for any payments to third parties in connection with intellectual property necessary to sell tyzeka sebivo 
the receivables from related party balance of million at december  consisted of the reimbursement by novartis of the contractual payments to third parties 

table of contents in july  we  novartis and certain other stockholders entered into the second amended and restated stockholder s agreement under which novartis maintains its rights to cause us to register for resale  under the securities act of  as amended  shares held by novartis and or its affiliates and we agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to nominate for election one designee of novartis for so long as novartis and its affiliates own at least of our common stock 
as of february   novartis owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
viiv healthcare company and glaxosmithkline collaboration in february  we licensed our non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor  or nnrti  compounds to glaxosmithkline  or gsk 
this agreement  which we refer to as the viiv license agreement  was assigned to viiv healthcare company  or viiv  which is an affiliate of gsk 
the viiv license agreement granted viiv an exclusive worldwide license to develop  manufacture and commercialize our nnrti compounds  including idx  now known as  for the treatment of human diseases  including human immunodeficiency virus type  or hiv  and acquired immune deficiency syndrome  or aids 
in february  we also entered into a stock purchase agreement with gsk  which we refer to as the gsk stock purchase agreement 
under this agreement  gsk purchased approximately million shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of million  or a per share price of 
these agreements became effective in march in march  we received a million payment related to this agreement  which consisted of a million license fee payment under the viiv license agreement and the million under the gsk stock purchase agreement described above 
in  we received million in milestone payments for the achievement of a preclinical operational milestone and the initiation of a phase iib clinical study of in february  viiv informed us that the fda placed on clinical hold and subsequently  the viiv license agreement was terminated on march  during the first quarter of  as a result of the termination  we recognized the deferred revenue balance of million as other collaboration revenue which was included in the consolidated statement of operations during the year ended december  results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues revenues for the years ended december  and were as follows years ended december  in thousands collaboration revenue related party license fee revenue royalty revenue reimbursement of royalties other revenue collaboration revenue total revenues 
table of contents collaboration revenue related party consisted of revenue associated with our collaboration with novartis for the worldwide development and commercialization of our drug candidates 
during the years ended december   and  collaboration revenue related party was comprised of the following through july   license and other fees received from novartis for the license of hbv and hcv drug candidates  net of changes for novartis stock subscription rights  which were being recognized over the development period of our licensed drug candidates  subsequent to july   the value of the non exclusive license that we granted to novartis for combination trials pursuant to the termination agreement  net of changes for novartis stock subscription rights  which are being recognized over the term of the non exclusive license  or seven years  through july   royalty payments associated with product sales of tyzeka sebivo made by novartis  and subsequent to july   reimbursement of royalties pursuant to novartis requirement to reimburse us for our contractual payments to the university of alabama at birmingham  or uab  in connection with intellectual property related to tyzeka sebivo 
collaboration revenue related party was million in as compared to million in the same period in the million increase was primarily due to the recognition of million representing the excess of deferred revenue over the besp of the non exclusive license granted to novartis for combination trials pursuant to the termination agreement 
additionally  license fee revenue increased million in related to the impact of novartis stock subscription rights 
reimbursement of royalties consisted of million recognized as a result of novartis requirement under the termination agreement to reimburse us for our contractual payments to uab in connection with intellectual property related to tyzeka sebivo 
collaboration revenue recognized under the viiv license agreement was million in as compared to million in the viiv license agreement was terminated on march  and as a result we recognized the deferred revenue balance of million as other collaboration revenue in the first quarter of cost of revenues cost of revenues were million in as compared to million in the increase of million was primarily due to the recognition of deferred expenses related to the termination of the viiv license agreement on march  research and development expenses research and development expenses were million in as compared to million in the increase of million was primarily due to million of expenses related to our phase ii clinical trial of idx and our clinical trials of idx in additionally  expenses increased million related to preclinical costs of idx and million related to our preclinical discovery program 
we expect our research and development expenses for to be higher than the amount incurred in mainly due to the development of our current clinical candidates and the expansion of our research pipeline 
we will continue to devote substantial resources to our research and development activities  expand our research pipeline and engage in future development activities as we continue to advance our drug candidates and explore collaborations with other entities that we believe will create shareholder value 

table of contents general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million in as compared to million in the increase of million was primarily due to additional legal costs associated with the us patent interference and patent litigation in various jurisdictions 
we expect our general and administrative expenses in to be significantly higher than those incurred in primarily due to expected higher legal costs associated with patent litigation in various jurisdictions 
intangible asset impairment under the termination agreement  we no longer receive royalty or milestone payments from novartis based upon worldwide product sales of tyzeka sebivo for the treatment of hbv 
we concluded that the intangible asset was effectively abandoned on the effective date of the termination agreement since there are no future cash flows associated with its use and the intangible asset has no alternate future use 
as a result  the carrying value of the related intangible asset is not recoverable and we recorded an impairment charge of million in our consolidated statement of operations during the year ended december  other income  net other income  net was million in as compared to million in the increase of million was primarily due to the reversal of reserves related to foreign research and development credits because the statute of limitations expired 
income tax benefit income tax benefit was less than million in which was substantially unchanged as compared to comparison of years ended december  and revenues revenues for the years ended december  and were as follows years ended december  in thousands collaboration revenue related party license fee revenue royalty revenue other revenue collaboration revenue government grants total revenues collaboration revenue related party was million in as compared to million in the million decrease in license fee revenue was primarily due to million related to the impact of novartis stock subscription rights and million due to adjusting the expected development period of our licensed drug candidates in  which represents the period over which we recognize license fee revenue 

table of contents collaboration revenue recognized under the viiv license agreement was million in as compared to million in the decrease of million was primarily due to the recognition of additional revenue in related to the million milestone payments received under the viiv license agreement 
a cumulative catch up of million was recognized in related to these milestone payments 
there were no milestone payments received during cost of revenues cost of revenues were million in as compared to million in the decrease of million was primarily a result of lower royalty payments due by us to a third party in in  we paid royalties to a third party associated with the million milestone payments received under the viiv license agreement in there were no milestone payments received in research and development expenses research and development expenses were million in as compared to million in the decrease of million was primarily due to million of lower expenses related to devoting fewer resources to our protease inhibitor and non nucleoside polymerase inhibitor programs in in addition  salaries and personnel related costs decreased million in compared to mainly due to a reduced headcount 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in expenses related to our nsa program 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million in as compared to million in the decrease of million was primarily due to million of severance and share based compensation expense related to the resignation of our former chief executive officer in  for which there is no comparable expense in restructuring charges in  we recorded restructuring charges of million for employee severance costs related to the reduction of our workforce in the united states and france 
all significant severance amounts were paid in there were no restructuring charges recorded in other income  net other income  net was million in which was substantially unchanged as compared to income tax benefit income tax benefit was less than million in which was substantially unchanged as compared to liquidity and capital resources since our inception in  we have financed our operations with proceeds obtained in connection with license and development arrangements and equity financings 
the proceeds include license  milestone  royalty and other payments from novartis through july   license  milestone and stock purchase payments from viiv and gsk through march   reimbursements from novartis for costs we have incurred subsequent to may  in connection with the development of tyzeka sebivo and compounds novartis previously licensed from us

prior to august  any financing requiring the issuance of additional shares of capital stock had to be first approved by novartis for so long as novartis continued to own at least of our voting stock 
this right was terminated in july under the second amended and restated stockholders agreement with novartis and therefore novartis approval was not required for the underwritten offering in august we received novartis approval for the following offerings in an in may  we received approval from novartis to issue capital shares pursuant to financing transactions under a shelf registration statement filed in september with the securities and exchange commission  or sec  so long as the issuance of shares did not reduce novartis interest in idenix below 
pursuant to this shelf registration statement  in april  we issued approximately million shares of our common stock pursuant to an underwritten offering and received million in net proceeds 
novartis did not participate in this offering  in april  we received approval from novartis to issue capital shares so long as the issuance of shares did not reduce novartis interest in idenix below 
in april  we issued approximately million shares of our common stock pursuant to the september shelf registration statement and approximately million shares of our common stock to novartis pursuant to a private placement agreement 
the net proceeds of both transactions were million 
upon completion of this offering  we fully utilized the shelf registration statement and novartis owned approximately of our outstanding common stock

in august  we issued million shares of our common stock under this shelf registration and received million in net proceeds 

table of contents we have incurred losses in each year since our inception and at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur losses over the next several years as we continue to expand our drug discovery and development efforts 
as a result  we may seek additional funding through a combination of public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements and we may seek a partner who will assist in the future development and commercialization of our drug candidates 
additional funding may not be available to us or  if available  may not be on terms favorable to us 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  other than novartis  which has the right to maintain its current ownership level 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to sustain operations into at least the second half of if we are unable to obtain adequate financing on a timely basis  we could be required to delay  reduce or eliminate one or more of our drug development programs  enter into new collaborative  strategic alliances or licensing arrangements that may not be favorable to us and reduce the number of our employees 
we had total cash and cash equivalents of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
our investment policy seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal and maintaining adequate liquidity 
as of december   all of our investments were in money market funds 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in net cash used in operating activities of million in compared to was primarily due to million higher operating expenses  excluding the intangible asset impairment of million in  partially offset by a million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses

pursuant to this settlement agreement  all contractual disputes relating to patents covering the use of certain synthetic nucleosides for the treatment of hbv and all litigation matters relating to patents and patent applications related to the use of l deoxy nucleosides for the treatment of hbv assigned to one or more of idenix  le centre national de la recherche scientifique  or cnrs  and the universite montpellier ii  or the university of montpellier  and which cover the use of tyzeka sebivo for the treatment of hbv have been resolved 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  we paid uabrf on behalf of uab and emory university a million upfront payment and agreed to make additional payments to uabrf equal to of all royalty payments received by us from novartis based on worldwide sales of tyzeka sebivo  subject to minimum payment obligations aggregating million 
our payment obligations under the settlement agreement will expire in august the settlement agreement was effective on june  and included mutual releases of all claims and covenants not to sue among the parties 
it also included a release from a third party scientist who had claimed to have inventorship rights in certain idenix cnrs university of montpellier patents 
under the july termination agreement with novartis  we no longer receive royalty or milestone payments from novartis based upon worldwide product sales of tyzeka sebivo for the treatment of hbv 
novartis is required to reimburse us for contractual payments to uabrf in connection with our intellectual property related to tyzeka sebivo 
included in receivables from related party was million for the reimbursement from novartis for our contractual payments to uabrf which have been recorded as collaboration revenue related party in our consolidated statement of operations during the year ended december  in connection with the certain of our operating leases for office and laboratory space  we have two letters of credit with a commercial bank totaling million which expire at varying dates through december  as of december   we had million of other long term liabilities 
these liabilities and certain potential payment obligations relating to our hbv and hcv product and drug candidates that are described below are excluded from the contractual obligations table above as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the cash payments may be made 
in may  we entered into a settlement agreement with uab which provides for a milestone payment of million to uab upon receipt of regulatory approval in the united states to market and sell certain hcv products invented or discovered by our former chief executive officer during the period from november  to november  this settlement agreement also provides that if such hcv products were approved and commercialized  we will pay uab an amount equal to of worldwide net sales of such hcv products with a minimum sales based payment equal to million 
such payments would be due even in the instance where we licensed such technology to a third party 
currently  there are no such hcv products approved and therefore there was no related liability recorded as of december  we have potential payment obligations under the license agreement with the universita degli studi di cagliari  or the university of cagliari  pursuant to which we have the exclusive worldwide right to make  use and sell certain hcv and other technologies 
we made certain payments to the university of cagliari under these arrangements based on the payments we received under the viiv and gsk collaboration 
as a result of the termination of the viiv license agreement  we will not receive any additional milestone or royalty payments under the viiv license transaction and therefore do not expect to make future payments to the university of cagliari for the patent and patent applications related to we are also liable for certain payments to the university of cagliari if we receive license fees  milestone payments or any other payments with respect to such technology from a collaborator or other third party 
in may  we and novartis entered into an amended and restated agreement with cnrs and the university of montpellier pursuant to which we worked in collaboration with scientists from cnrs and the university of montpellier to discover and develop technologies relating to antiviral substances  including 
table of contents telbivudine 
this cooperative agreement expired in december  but we retain rights to exploit the patents derived from the collaboration 
under the cooperative agreement  we are obligated to make royalty payments for products derived from such patents  including products for hbv  hcv and hiv 
such payments would be due even in the instance where we licensed such patents to a third party 
under the termination agreement  we no longer receive royalty or milestone payments from novartis based upon worldwide product sales of tyzeka sebivo for the treatment of hbv 
novartis is required to reimburse us for our contractual payments to cnrs and the university of montpellier  subject to our assignment to novartis of our patent rights under the amended and restated agreement with cnrs and the university of montpellier within months of the execution of the termination agreement  in connection with our intellectual property related to tyzeka sebivo 
until the assignment of such patent rights to novartis is effective  payments from novartis to reimburse us for our contractual payments to cnrs will be recorded as a deferred payment obligation on our consolidated balance sheet and we will continue to charge payments we make to cnrs to cost of revenues on our consolidated statement of operations 
we are in the process of assigning these patent rights to novartis 
in march  we entered into a final settlement agreement with sumitomo under which the rights to develop and commercialize telbivudine in japan  china  south korea and taiwan previously granted to sumitomo were returned to us 
this agreement with sumitomo became effective upon consummation of our collaboration with novartis in may the settlement agreement which we entered into with sumitomo provides for a million milestone payment to sumitomo if and when the first commercial sale of telbivudine occurs in japan 
as part of the termination agreement  novartis remains obligated to reimburse us for any such payment made to sumitomo 
off balance sheet transactions we currently have no off balance sheet transactions 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  accrued expenses and share based compensation which are described below 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  however  we believe that the following critical accounting policies are important to the understanding and evaluating of our reported financial results 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab no 
 as amended by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and  for revenue arrangements entered into after june   in accordance with the revenue recognition guidance of the financial accounting standards board  or fasb 
for multiple element arrangements entered into or materially modified after january   we recognize revenue under accounting standard update no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu no 
 which a provides updated guidance on when multiple elements exist  how the elements in an arrangement should be separated and 
table of contents how the arrangement considerations should be allocated to the separate elements  b requires an entity to allocate arrangement considerations to each element based on a selling price hierarchy  where the selling price for an element is based on vsoe  if available  tpe  if available and vsoe is not available  or the besp  if neither vsoe nor tpe is available  and c eliminates the use of the residual method and requires an entity to allocate arrangement considerations using the selling price hierarchy 
we record revenue provided that there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
our revenues are generated primarily through collaborative research  development and or commercialization agreements 
the terms of these agreements typically include payments to us for non refundable license fees  milestones  collaborative research and development funding and royalties received from our collaboration partners 
non refundable license fee payments where we have continuing performance obligations under the terms of a collaborative arrangement  non refundable license fees are recognized as revenue over the expected development period as we complete our performance obligations 
when our level of effort is relatively constant over the performance period or no other performance pattern is evident  the revenue is recognized on a straight line basis 
the determination of the performance period involves judgment on the part of management 
payments received from collaboration partners for research and development efforts by us are recognized as revenue over the contract term as the related costs are incurred  net of any amounts due to the collaboration partner for costs incurred during the period for shared development costs 
where we have no continuing involvement or obligations under a collaborative arrangement  we record non refundable license fee revenue when we have a contractual right to receive the payment  in accordance with the terms of the license agreement 
milestone payments revenue is recognized for payments that are contingent upon the achievement of a milestone in its entirety  in the period in which the milestone is achieved  only if the milestone is substantive and meets all of the following criteria a performance consideration earned by achieving the milestone be commensurate with either performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the item delivered as a result of a specific outcome resulting from performance to achieve the milestone  b it relates to past performance  and c the payment is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement 
collaboration revenue related party in may  we entered into the development and commercialization agreement with novartis which related to the worldwide development and commercialization of our drug candidates 
this agreement along with several other agreements between us and novartis constituted our collaborative arrangement with novartis  which was treated as a single unit of accounting for revenue recognition purposes 
in july  the development and commercialization agreement was materially amended and the termination agreement was entered into between us and novartis 
the termination agreement is described in detail in note in the footnotes to the financial statements to this annual report on form k 

table of contents development and commercialization agreement prior to august  under the development and commercialization agreement with novartis  we received non refundable license fees  milestones  collaborative research and development funding and royalty payments 
this agreement had several joint committees in which we and novartis participated 
we participated in these committees as a means to govern or protect our interests 
the committees spanned the period from early development through commercialization of drug candidates licensed by novartis 
as a result of applying the provisions of sab no 
 which was the applicable revenue guidance at the time the collaboration was entered into  our revenue recognition policy attributes revenue to the development period of the drug candidates licensed under the development and commercialization agreement 
we did not attribute revenue to our involvement in the committees following the commercialization of the licensed products as we determined that our participation on the committees  as such participation relates to the commercialization of drug candidates  is protective 
our determination was based in part on the fact that our expertise is  and has been  the discovery and development of drugs for the treatment of human viral diseases 
novartis  on the other hand  has the considerable commercialization expertise and infrastructure necessary for the commercialization of such drug candidates 
accordingly  we believed our obligation post commercialization was inconsequential 
prior to august  we recognized non refundable payments received from novartis over the performance period of our continuing obligations 
in the second quarter of  we adjusted the period over which we amortize the deferred payments to be through may based on then current judgments related to the product development timeline of our licensed drug candidates 
we reviewed our assessment and judgment on a quarterly basis with respect to the expected duration of the development period of our licensed drug candidates 
if the estimated performance period changed  we would adjust the periodic revenue that was being recognized and would have recorded the remaining unrecognized non refundable payments over the remaining development period during which our performance obligations would be completed 
significant judgments and estimates were involved in determining the estimated development period and different assumptions could yield materially different results 
prior to august  upon the grant of options and stock awards under our stock incentive plans  with the exception of the plan  the fair value of our common stock that would be issuable to novartis  less the exercise price  was recorded as a reduction of the non refundable payments associated with the novartis collaboration 
the amount was attributed proportionately between cumulative revenue recognized through the current date and the remaining amount of deferred revenue 
novartis retains these rights under the second amended and restated stockholders agreement that was executed in july as of july   the aggregate impact of novartis stock subscription rights reduced the non refundable payments by million  which was recorded as additional paid in capital 
of this amount  million was recorded as a reduction of deferred revenue with the remaining amount of million recorded as a reduction of license fee revenue 
for the period of january through july  the impact of novartis stock subscription rights increased additional paid in capital by million  decreased deferred revenue by million and decreased license fee revenue by million 
commencing in august  the change in fair value of novartis stock subscription rights under the second amended and restated stockholders agreement is accounted for solely as an adjustment to the revenue recognized from novartis non exclusive right to conduct combination trials under the termination agreement 
novartis stock subscription rights no longer impact deferred revenue 
the fair value of the stock subscription rights as of december  was estimated using a trinomial lattice valuation model which included inputs of our per share common stock price  exercise prices of outstanding options  expected term of our options and exercise rates as well as assumptions regarding expected volatility and exercise multiples 
for the period of august through december  using the trinomial lattice model  the impact of novartis s stock subscription rights decreased additional paid in capital by million and increased license fee revenue by million primarily due to the decline in our stock price 

table of contents for the year ended december   the impact of novartis stock subscription rights has decreased additional paid in capital by million  decreased deferred revenue by million and increased license fee revenue by million 
prior to august  royalty revenue consisted of revenue earned under our license agreement with novartis for sales of tyzeka sebivo  which was recognized when reported from novartis 
royalty revenue was equal to a percentage of tyzeka sebivo net sales  with such percentage increasing according to specified tiers of net sales 
the royalty percentage varied based on the specified territory and the aggregate dollar amount of net sales 
under the termination agreement executed in july  we no longer receive royalty milestone payments from novartis based upon worldwide product sales of tyzeka sebivo for the treatment of hbv 
termination agreement in july  we and novartis materially amended the development and commercialization agreement that was established in may  which is considered a material modification under asu no 
since august  we recognize revenue related to the termination agreement with novartis under asu no 
which a provides updated guidance on when multiple elements exist  how the elements in an arrangement should be separated and how the arrangement considerations should be allocated to the separate elements  b requires an entity to allocate arrangement considerations to each element based on a selling price hierarchy  where the selling price for an element is based on vsoe  if available  or tpe  if available and vsoe is not available  or the besp  if neither vsoe nor tpe is available  and c eliminates the use of the residual method and requires an entity to allocate arrangement considerations using the selling price hierarchy 
we evaluated our modified arrangement with novartis and determined that the agreements should continue to be treated as a single unit of accounting 
under the termination agreement we granted novartis a non exclusive license to conduct clinical trials evaluating a combination of any of our and novartis hcv drug candidates after the hcv drug candidates have completed dose ranging studies  subject to meeting certain criteria 
the non exclusive license is the only revenue generating deliverable remaining under the modified arrangement and since neither vsoe nor tpe for the non exclusive license deliverable was available  the selling price for the non exclusive license was established using the besp 
prior to the execution of the termination agreement  the balance of deferred revenue  related party was million 
we determined that the besp of novartis non exclusive license at july  was million 
we recognized the excess deferred revenue over the besp  or million  as collaborative revenue related party in the third quarter of as of december   the remaining balance of million was included in deferred revenue  related party in our consolidated balance sheet and will be recognized as collaboration revenue related party on a straight line basis over the term of the non exclusive license  or seven years 
in establishing besp for the non exclusive license  we used a discounted cash flow model and considered the likelihood of our and novartis drugs being commercialized  the development and commercialization timeline  discount rate  and probable treatment combination and associated peak sales figures which generate royalty amounts 
our key assumptions in the discounted cash flow model included the following market conditions and entity specific factors a the specific rights and limitations provided under the non exclusive license to conduct clinical trials evaluating a combination of any of our and novartis hcv drug candidates  b the current stage of development of novartis hcv drug candidates and related risks and estimated commercialization timelines  c the probability of successfully developing and commercializing a combination hcv drug therapy  d the probable treatment combination  e the market size for the probable treatment combination including the associated sales figures which generate royalty revenue  and f the expected product life of the probable treatment combination assuming commercialization 
we utilized an industry standard royalty rate in our analysis representing the mean royalty rate for phase ii product licensing 
we utilized a discount rate representing the risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital derived from returns on capital for comparable companies 
these assumptions involve judgment and uncertainty 

table of contents other revenue in february  we entered into the viiv license agreement 
under the viiv license agreement  we granted viiv an exclusive worldwide license to develop  manufacture and commercialize our nnrti compounds  including idx  now known as  for the treatment of human diseases  including hiv aids 
this agreement had performance obligations  including joint committee participation and viiv s right to license other nnrti compounds that we may develop in the future  that we had assessed under the fasb guidance related to multiple element arrangements  prior to the implementation of asu no 
we concluded that this arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting and recognized as revenue using the contingency adjusted performance method 
under this agreement  we received a non refundable license fee payment and milestone payments from viiv 
these milestone payments did not meet the revenue recognition criteria for immediate recognition 
the non refundable license fee payment and milestone payments received from viiv were recorded as deferred revenue and were being recognized as revenue over the life of the agreement  which was estimated to be years 
a cumulative catch up was recognized for the period from the execution of the license agreement in march through the period in which the milestone payments were received 
in february  viiv informed us that the fda placed on clinical hold and subsequently  the viiv license agreement was terminated on march  upon termination  viiv relinquished all rights it had in the intellectual property licensed from us and granted us an exclusive  perpetual and irrevocable license to any intellectual property relating to the licensed products it may have developed during the term of the license agreement 
we will not receive any additional milestone or royalty payments under the viiv license agreement 
during the first quarter of  as a result of the termination  we recognized the deferred revenue balance of million as other collaboration revenue 
government research grants that provide for payments to us for work performed are recognized as revenue when the related expense is incurred and we have obtained governmental approval to use the grant funds for these expenses 
deferred revenue in march  we entered into a final settlement agreement with sumitomo under which the rights to develop and commercialize telbivudine in japan  china  south korea and taiwan previously granted to sumitomo were returned to us 
this agreement with sumitomo became effective upon consummation of our collaboration with novartis in may we repurchased these product rights for million 
the repurchase of these rights resulted in a million reversal of revenue that we previously recognized under our original arrangements with sumitomo 
we recorded the remaining amount of million as a reduction of deferred revenue 
we have also included million as deferred revenue  net of current portion in our consolidated balance sheets at december  and representing amounts received from sumitomo that we have not included in our revenue to date 
we are required to pay an additional million to sumitomo if and when the first commercial sale of telbivudine occurs in japan 
this payment will be recorded first as a reduction of the remaining million of deferred revenue  with the excess recorded as an expense 
as part of the july termination agreement  novartis remains obligated to reimburse us for any such payment made to sumitomo 
if regulatory approval is not received for telbivudine in japan  we would have no further obligations under the settlement agreement with sumitomo and  therefore  the million of remaining deferred revenue would be recognized as revenue at that time 
accrued expenses we accrue expenses we have incurred but have not been invoiced 
this process involves estimating the level of service performed by third parties on our behalf and the associated cost incurred for these services as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of estimated accrued expenses in which subjective judgments may be required include services provided by contract organizations for preclinical development  
table of contents clinical trials and manufacturing of clinical materials 
accruals for amounts due to clinical research organizations are among our most significant estimates 
in connection with these service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual level of services incurred by the service providers 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of services is often subject to our judgment 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation for employees and directors using a fair value based method that results in expense being recognized in our financial statements 
we make assumptions related to the expected volatility of our stock and the expected term of the awards granted in order to value and expense our share based compensation 
the expected option term and expected volatility are determined by examining the expected option term and volatility of our own stock as well as those of similarly sized biotechnology companies 
we review these assumptions periodically 
the amounts recognized for share based compensation expense could vary depending upon changes in these assumptions 
share based compensation expense is recognized based on awards ultimately expected to vest and should be reduced for estimated forfeitures 
during  and  because substantially all of our stock option grants vest monthly  no forfeiture assumption was applied 
for purposes of our consolidated statements of operations  we allocate share based compensation to expense categories based on the nature of the service provided by the recipients of the stock option grants 
we expect to continue to grant options to purchase common stock in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  fasb issued accounting standard update no 
 disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 
the amendments in this update require an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
an entity is required to apply the amendments for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods 
an entity should provide the disclosures required by those amendments retrospectively for all comparative periods presented 
we do not expect its adoption to have a material impact on our financial position or results of our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk changes in interest rates may impact our financial position  operating results or cash flows 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital while maintaining liquidity until it is required to fund operations 
to minimize risk  we maintain our operating cash in commercial bank accounts 
we invest our cash in high quality financial instruments  primarily money market funds 
due to the nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk our foreign currency transactions include a subsidiary in france that is denominated in euros 
as a result of these foreign currency transactions  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows can be affected by market fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of fluctuations in currency exchange rates
