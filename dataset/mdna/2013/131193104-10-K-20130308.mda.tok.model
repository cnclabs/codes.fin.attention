for a complete discussion of all of the company s significant accounting policies  see note significant accounting policies to the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
revenue recognition sales are recognized in accordance with accounting standards codification asc topic  revenue recognition  as products are shipped to customers  net of an allowance for sales returns and accruals for sales programs 
the company records a reserve for anticipated returns through a reduction of sales and cost of sales in the period that the related sales are recorded 
sales returns are estimated based upon historical returns  current economic trends  changes in customer demands and sell through of products 
in addition  from time to time  the company offers sales programs that allow for specific returns 
the company records a reserve for anticipated returns related to these sales programs based on the terms of the sales program as well as historical returns  current economic trends  changes in customer demands and sell through of products 
historically  the company s actual sales returns have not been materially different from management s original estimates 
the company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the allowance for sales returns 
however  if the actual costs of sales returns are significantly different than the recorded estimated allowance  the company may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
assuming there had been a increase over the recorded estimated allowance for sales returns  pre tax loss for the year ended december  would have been increased by approximately million 
the company also records estimated reductions to revenue for sales programs such as incentive offerings 
sales program accruals are estimated based upon the attributes of the sales program  management s forecast of future product demand  and historical customer participation in similar programs 
the company s primary sales program  the preferred retailer program  offers longer payment terms during the initial sell in period  as well as potential rebates and discounts  for participating retailers in exchange for providing certain benefits to the company  including the maintenance of agreed upon inventory levels  prime product placement and retailer staff training 
under this program  qualifying retailers can earn either discounts or rebates based upon the amount of product purchased 
discounts are applied and recorded at the time of sale 
for rebates  the company accrues an estimate of the rebate at the time of sale based on the customer s estimated qualifying current year product purchases 
the estimate is based on the historical level of purchases  adjusted for any factors expected to affect the current year purchase levels 
the estimated year end rebate is adjusted quarterly based on actual purchase levels  as necessary 
the preferred retailer program is generally short term in nature and the actual costs of the 
table of contents program are known as of the end of the year and paid to customers shortly after year end 
in addition to the preferred retailer program  the company from time to time offers additional sales program incentive offerings which are also generally short term in nature 
historically the company s actual costs related to its preferred retailer program and other sales programs have not been materially different than its estimates 
revenues from gift cards are deferred and recognized when the cards are redeemed 
in addition  the company recognizes revenue from unredeemed gift cards when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote and under circumstances that comply with any applicable state escheatment laws 
the company s gift cards have no expiration 
to determine when redemption is remote  the company analyzes an aging of unredeemed cards based on the date the card was last used or the activation date if the card has never been used and compares that information with historical redemption trends 
the company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to determine the timing of recognition of gift card revenues 
however  if the company is not able to accurately determine when gift card redemption is remote  the company may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
the deferred revenue associated with outstanding gift cards decreased from million at december  to million at december  revenues from course credits in connection with the use of the company s upro gps devices are deferred when purchased and recognized on a straight line basis over a three year period 
although the company announced in july the transition of its integrated device business to a third party based model  the company will continue to maintain services related to course credits used in conjunction with the upro gps devices 
deferred revenue associated with unused course credits decreased to million at december  from million at december  allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of its customers to make required payments 
an estimate of uncollectible amounts is made by management based upon historical bad debts  current customer receivable balances  age of customer receivable balances  the customer s financial condition and current economic trends  all of which are subject to change 
if the actual uncollected amounts significantly exceed the estimated allowance  the company s operating results would be significantly adversely affected 
assuming there had been a increase over the recorded estimated allowance for doubtful accounts  pre tax loss for the year ended december  would have been increased by approximately million 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or fair market value 
cost is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
the inventory balance  which includes material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs  is recorded net of an estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory 
the estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory is based upon current inventory levels  sales trends and historical experience as well as management s understanding of market conditions and forecasts of future product demand  all of which are subject to change 
the calculation of the company s allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging  forecasted consumer demand and pricing  regulatory usga and r a rule changes  the promotional environment and technological obsolescence 
the company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the allowance 
however  if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner  the company may need to increase its inventory allowance  which could significantly adversely affect the company s operating results 
assuming there had been a increase over the recorded estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory  pre tax loss for the year ended december  would have been increased by approximately million 

table of contents long lived assets  goodwill and non amortizing intangible assets in the normal course of business  the company acquires tangible and intangible assets 
the company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of its long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and amortizing intangible assets  and investments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable or exceeds its fair value 
the company evaluates the recoverability of its goodwill and non amortizing intangible assets at least annually or whenever indicators that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable are present 
determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions  including determining the amount of undiscounted cash flows directly related to the potentially impaired asset  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  the timing of the impairment test  and the asset s residual value  if any 
to determine fair value  the company uses its internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate rate  quoted market prices  royalty rates when available and independent appraisals as appropriate 
any required impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the asset and a charge to earnings 
the company uses its best judgment based on current facts and circumstances related to its business when making these estimates 
however  if actual results are not consistent with the company s estimates and assumptions used in calculating future cash flows and asset fair values  the company may be exposed to losses that could be material 
as of december   the estimated fair values of the company s reporting units in the us  united kingdom  canada and korea  as well as the estimated fair values of certain trade names and trademarks  exceeded their carrying values 
in september  in connection with the company s cost reduction initiatives that were announced in july  the company committed to a plan to transition its integrated device business to a third party based model 
as a result  the company performed an impairment analysis and determined that the estimated discounted cash flows from the sales of upro gps devices were less than the carrying values of the intangible assets and goodwill associated with the uplay  llc acquisition  which was completed as of december  this analysis resulted in the recognition of impairment charges of million to write off amortizing intangible assets and goodwill associated with the uplay  llc acquisition  in addition to charges of million to write off property  plant and equipment related to upro gps devices

table of contents warranty policy the company has a stated two year warranty policy for its golf clubs 
the company s policy is to accrue the estimated cost of satisfying future warranty claims at the time the sale is recorded 
in estimating its future warranty obligations  the company considers various relevant factors  including the company s stated warranty policies and practices  the historical frequency of claims  and the cost to replace or repair its products under warranty 
the company s estimates for calculating the warranty reserve are principally based on assumptions regarding the warranty costs of each club product line over the expected warranty period 
where little or no claims experience may exist  the company s warranty obligation calculation is based upon long term historical warranty rates of similar products until sufficient data is available 
as actual model specific rates become available  the company s estimates are modified to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes 
historically  the company s actual warranty claims have not been materially different from management s original estimated warranty obligation 
the company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the warranty obligation 
however  if the number of actual warranty claims or the cost of satisfying warranty claims significantly exceeds the estimated warranty reserve  the company may be exposed to losses that could be material 
assuming there had been a increase over the recorded estimated allowance for warranty obligations  pre tax loss for the year ended december  would have been increased by approximately million 
income taxes current income tax expense or benefit is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable or receivable for the current year 
a deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability computed pursuant to asc topic  income taxes  and its reported amount in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled  respectively 
the company maintains a valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset when it is deemed to be more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required under such rules  the company considers all available positive and negative evidence  including prior operating results  the nature and reason for any losses  its forecast of future taxable income  and the dates on which any deferred tax assets are expected to expire 
these assumptions require a significant amount of judgment  including estimates of future taxable income 
these estimates are based on the company s best judgment at the time made based on current and projected circumstances and conditions 
in  as a result of this evaluation  the company recorded a valuation allowance against its us deferred tax assets 
at the end of each interim and annual reporting period  as the us deferred tax assets are adjusted upwards or downwards  the associated valuation allowance and income tax expense are also adjusted 
if sufficient positive evidence arises in the future  such as a sustained return to profitability in the us business  the valuation allowance could be reversed as appropriate  decreasing income tax expense in the period that such conclusion is reached 
the company has concluded that with respect to non us entities  there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that the realization of its deferred tax assets is deemed to be likely  and no allowances have been established 
in addition  the company has discontinued recognizing income tax benefits related to its us net operating losses until it is determined that it is more likely than not that the company will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefits from its us deferred tax assets 
pursuant to asc topic  the company is required to accrue for the estimated additional amount of taxes for uncertain tax positions if it is deemed to be more likely than not that the company would be required to pay such additional taxes 

table of contents the company is required to file federal and state income tax returns in the united states and various other income tax returns in foreign jurisdictions 
the preparation of these income tax returns requires the company to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions  which could affect the amount of tax paid by the company 
the company accrues an amount for its estimate of additional tax liability  including interest and penalties  for any uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return 
the company reviews and updates the accrual for uncertain tax positions as more definitive information becomes available 
historically  additional taxes paid as a result of the resolution of the company s uncertain tax positions have not been materially different from the company s expectations 
information regarding income taxes is contained in note income taxes to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation the company accounts for share based compensation arrangements in accordance with asc topic  stock compensation  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards to employees and non employees based on estimated fair values 
asc topic further requires a reduction in share based compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate 
the forfeiture rate used by the company is based on historical forfeiture trends 
if actual forfeitures are not consistent with the company s estimates  the company may be required to increase or decrease compensation expenses in future periods 
the company uses the black scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of its stock options and stock appreciation rights sars at the date of grant 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the company s expected stock price volatility  the expected dividend yield  the expected term of an option or sar and the risk free interest rate  which is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the company uses historical data to estimate the expected price volatility and the expected term 
the company uses forecasted dividends to estimate the expected dividend yield 
changes in subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option or sar 
furthermore  the estimated fair value of an option or sar does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by an employee 
compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period for stock options 
compensation expense for sars is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period based on award s estimated fair value  which is remeasured at the end of each reporting period 
once vested  sars continued to be remeasured to fair value until they are exercised 
the company records compensation expense for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units collectively restricted stock based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant 
the estimated fair value is determined based on the closing price of the company s common stock on the date of grant multiplied by the number of shares awarded 
compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period  reduced by an estimated forfeiture rate 
phantom stock units psus are a form of share based awards that are indexed to the company s stock and are settled in cash 
compensation expense for psus is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period based on the award s estimated fair value 
fair value is remeasured at the end of each interim reporting period through the award s settlement date and is based on the closing price of the company s stock

table of contents results of operations overview of business and seasonality the company designs  manufactures and sells high quality golf clubs and golf balls  and also sells golf accessories  such as golf bags  golf gloves  headwear and other golf related accessories 
in addition  the company licenses its trademarks and service marks in exchange for a royalty fee to third parties for use on golf related accessories  including apparel  footwear  eyewear  rangefinders and practice aids 
the company designs its products to be technologically advanced and in this regard invests a considerable amount in research and development each year 
the company s golf products are designed for golfers of all skill levels  both amateur and professional 
the company has two operating segments that are organized on the basis of products  namely the golf clubs segment and golf balls segment 
the golf clubs segment consists primarily of callaway golf woods  hybrids  irons  wedges and putters as well as odyssey putters 
this segment also includes other golf related accessories described above and royalties from licensing of the company s trademarks and service marks as well as sales of pre owned golf clubs 
the golf balls segment consists primarily of callaway golf and top flite golf balls 
the company sold the top flite brand in march see note goodwill and intangible assets to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as discussed in note segment information to the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company s operating segments exclude a significant amount of corporate general administrative expenses and other income expense not utilized by management in determining segment profitability 
in most of the regions where the company does business  the game of golf is played primarily on a seasonal basis 
weather conditions generally restrict golf from being played year round  except in a few markets  with many of the company s on course customers closing for the cold weather months 
the company s business is therefore subject to seasonal fluctuations 
in general  during the first quarter  the company begins selling its products into the golf retail channel for the new golf season 
this initial sell in generally continues into the second quarter 
the company s second quarter sales are significantly affected by the amount of reorder business of the products sold during the first quarter 
the company s third quarter sales are generally dependent on reorder business but are generally less than the second quarter as many retailers begin decreasing their inventory levels in anticipation of the end of the golf season 
the company s fourth quarter sales are generally less than the other quarters due to the end of the golf season in many of the company s key markets 
however  fourth quarter sales can be affected from time to time by the early launch of product introductions related to the new golf season of the subsequent year 
this seasonality  and therefore quarter to quarter fluctuations  can be affected by many factors  including the timing of new product introductions 
in general  however  because of this seasonality  a majority of the company s sales and most  if not all  of its profitability generally occurs during the first half of the year 
approximately half of the company s business is conducted in regions outside of the united states in currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  changes in foreign currency rates can have a significant effect on the company s financial results 
the company enters into foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency rates 
while these foreign currency exchange contracts can mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency rates  they do not eliminate those effects  which can be significant 
these effects include i the translation of results denominated in foreign currency into us dollars for reporting purposes  ii the mark to market adjustments of certain intercompany balance sheet accounts denominated in foreign currencies  and iii the mark to market adjustments on the company s foreign currency exchange contracts 
in general  the company s overall financial results are affected positively by a weaker us dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger us dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which the company conducts its business 
during  the company s financial results were negatively affected by the translation of sales denominated in foreign currencies into us dollars

table of contents the wind down of certain non core businesses the company exited in as well as increased sales promotions in response to the challenging marketplace combined with other actions the company took to prepare the business for a turnaround in this decline in the company s net sales and gross margins was partially offset by a million decline in operating expenses in compared to primarily due to a reduction in employee costs as a result of the company s cost reduction initiatives announced in july although management is not satisfied with the company s financial results on an absolute basis  the results reflect many actions that should be beneficial in the long term

see note income taxes to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
the company continues to make progress on its cost reduction initiatives  which are aimed to better align the company s cost structure with its current business levels and change the manner in which the company approaches and operates its business 
the actions include i a reduction in workforce that impacts all regions and levels of the organization  ii greater focus on the company s core product lines  including licensing to third parties the rights to develop  manufacture and distribute certain non core product lines eg apparel and footwear as well as transitioning to a third party based model for its integrated device business  and iii the reorganization of the company s golf ball manufacturing supply chain  which includes the sale and lease back of a reduced portion of the square footage of the company s ball manufacturing facility in chicopee  massachusetts 
the company expects to incur total pre tax charges of approximately million in connection with these initiatives  of which approximately two thirds is expected to result in non cash expenditures 
to date  the company has incurred total charges related to its cost reduction initiatives of million  of which million was recorded during the fourth quarter of these initiatives are estimated to yield approximately million in gross annualized savings 
the company continues to make solid progress on its turnaround plan 
in addition to the cost reduction initiatives discussed above  and the actions taken earlier in  including the sale of the top flite and ben hogan brands  changes in senior management  and changes in the company s approach to product design and the sales and marketing functions  the company also replaced a majority of its outstanding preferred stock with much less expensive convertible notes 
these key initiatives are all consistent with management s efforts to simplify the business  focus the team on the company s core business of golf clubs and golf balls  and reduce its cost structure 
management believes that these initiatives will result in improved financial results in
