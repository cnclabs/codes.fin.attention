the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview questcor is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the treatment of patients with serious  difficult to treat autoimmune and inflammatory disorders 
our primary product is hp acthar gel repository corticotropin injection  or acthar  an injectable drug that is approved by the us food and drug administration  or fda  for the treatment of indications 
of these fda approved indications  we currently generate substantially all of our net sales from the following indications nephrotic syndrome ns acthar is indicated to induce a diuresis or a remission of proteinuria in the nephrotic syndrome without uremia of the idiopathic type or that due to lupus erythematosus 
according to the national kidney foundation  nephrotic syndrome can result from several idiopathic type kidney disorders  including idiopathic membranous nephropathy  focal segmental glomerulosclerosis  iga nephropathy and minimal change disease 
nephrotic syndrome can also occur due to lupus erythematosus 
in this form k  the terms nephrotic syndrome and ns refer only to the proteinuria in nephrotic syndrome conditions that are covered by the acthar label of approved indications 
multiple sclerosis ms acthar is indicated for the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis in adults 
controlled clinical trials have shown acthar to be effective in speeding the resolution of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis 
however  there is no evidence that it affects the ultimate outcome or natural history of the disease 
infantile spasms is acthar is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of infantile spasms in infants and children under years of age 
we continue to support this vulnerable patient population 
we believe that a significant percentage of the million in free drug we have provided through the national organization of rare disorders  from september through december   has been used to treat is 
we support the is community through other initiatives 
in february  we were awarded the first ever corporate citizenship award presented by the child neurology foundation 
this award honors our long term commitment to support the child neurology community as well as our specific efforts to fund education and research related to is 
rheumatology related conditions acthar is approved for the following rheumatology related conditions i collagen diseases acthar is indicated during an exacerbation or as maintenance therapy in selected cases of systemic lupus erythematosus  systemic dermatomyositis polymyositis and ii rheumatic disorders acthar is indicated as adjunctive therapy for short term administration to tide the patient over an acute episode or exacerbation in psoriatic arthritis  rheumatoid arthritis  including juvenile rheumatoid arthritis selected cases may require low dose maintenance therapy  and ankylosing spondylitis 
we continue to explore additional markets for other on label indications 
in addition  we are exploring the possibility of pursuing fda approval for indications not currently on the acthar label that are related to the treatment of other serious  difficult to treat autoimmune and inflammatory disorders having high unmet medical need 
our other product is doral quazepam  which is indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulty in falling asleep  frequent nocturnal awakenings  and or early morning awakenings 
we own the us rights to and have modest sales of doral 
results of operations years ended december   and net sales 
net sales  which we derive from our sales of acthar and doral  were million in  compared to million in and million in the following table sets forth our net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively in thousands 
table of contents years ended december  revenue less sales reserves provision for medicaid rebates provision for chargebacks provision for coverage gap discount provision for tricare rebates co payment assistance and other total sales reserves net sales compared to net sales of acthar increased by approximately to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase in net sales was attributable to increased vial demand from curascript sd  our distributor for acthar 
we shipped  vials for the year ended december  as compared to  vials shipped for the year ended december  while we do not receive complete information regarding prescriptions by therapeutic area  we believe increased demand from curascript sd was driven by strong prescription growth in each of our ns and ms therapeutic areas 
net sales for the year ended december  were also positively affected by increases in the price we charge curascript sd for acthar 
we increased the price of acthar on december  by and on may  by  and currently charge curascript sd  per vial 
our net sales are also impacted by the amount of our sales reserves  which are deducted from revenue in the calculation of net sales 
during the years ended december   and  the largest component of our sales reserves related to our provision for medicaid rebates 
this provision is impacted by two factors 
first  our business mix across therapeutic areas affects our provision for medicaid rebates since the percentage of patients that are enrolled in medicaid varies by therapeutic area 
specifically  a lower percentage of adults are enrolled in medicaid than are infants 
as such  the growth in our ns and ms sales relative to is sales has resulted in an overall lower percentage of sales being attributable to patients enrolled in medicaid 
second  the rebate amount for acthar affects our provision for medicaid rebates 
for the year ended december   we recorded a provision of of our gross revenue for sales related reserves  a decrease from the in the year ended december  during the years ended december   and  the medicaid rebate amount equaled of the average manufacturer price  or amp  of acthar which approximates the amount we charge to curascript sd 
as such  we did not generate any net sales in connection with medicaid business 
during the first quarter of  the medicaid rebate amount for acthar was reset from of the amp of acthar to the basic rebate amount of of amp 
we believe that approximately three quarters of our growth in net sales from to was due to increased vial shipments  with the remainder of our net sales growth being due to the increase in the percentage of our product sales that are not subject to medicaid rebates as described above  as well as increased product pricing 
however  it is difficult to ascribe the sources of net sales growth to these individual factors as the factors might not be independent 
we believe that acthar represents a promising potential therapy for patients suffering from the difficult to treat  on label medical conditions for which we currently promote acthar 
acthar  however  remains relatively unknown to physicians who practice in the relevant medical specialties 
as a result  we have expanded our sales force in order to increase our ability to educate such physicians about acthar potential benefit to their patients 
it is unclear whether this will continue to result in increased net sales 
the process of significantly expanding a sales force in the biopharmaceutical industry is complex 
we modify and re allocate individual sales territories across our enlarged sales force  which can cause temporary disruptions in our selling efforts 
additionally  while the cost of our new sales representatives impacts our operating expenses immediately  there can be a delay in the expected ability of our new representatives to increase our net sales due to the time it takes for us to train the new representatives and for the new representatives to establish professional relationships with prescribing physicians within their territories 
acthar orders may be affected by several factors  including inventory levels at specialty and hospital pharmacies  greater use of patient assistance programs  the overall pattern of usage by the health care community  including medicaid and government supported entities  the use of alternative therapies  and the reimbursement policies of insurance companies 
our specialty distributor ships acthar to specialty pharmacies and hospitals to meet end user demand 
we track our own acthar shipments daily  but those shipments vary compared to end user demand and because of changes in inventory levels at specialty pharmacies and hospitals 
as a result of the variation in order patterns  in channel inventory levels may be positively or 
table of contents negatively affected 
for example  in late december  we received and shipped two orders of acthar for a total of vials 
we believe that distribution channel inventory was at the high end of the normal historic range as of december  compared to net sales of acthar increased by approximately to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in net sales was due to an increase in the number of acthar vials shipped from  vials shipped in  up to  vials shipped in  a reduction in the per vial rebate liability for both medicaid and tricare  and a reduction in the number of medicaid fee for service prescriptions 
this increase was partially offset by an increase in our medicaid managed care organization rebate  which became effective on march  our increased detailing efforts and our initiatives to educate ms specialists about the treatment benefits of acthar resulted in a significant increase in sales of acthar to treat select ms exacerbation patients for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in during the year ended december   new paid acthar prescriptions processed by our reimbursement support center for the treatment of ms exacerbations increased by approximately as compared to cost of sales and gross profit years ended december  cost of sales gross profit gross margin cost of sales was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for and million for we include in cost of sales material costs  packaging  warehousing and distribution  product liability insurance  royalties  quality control which primarily includes product stability testing  quality assurance and reserves for excess or obsolete inventory 
our gross margin and gross profit was and million  respectively  in  as compared to and million  respectively  in and and million  respectively  in the increase in gross profit dollars is due to continued growth in paid prescriptions for all of our indications 
the increase in cost of sales was primarily due to an increase in net sales coupled with an increase in the cost for outside product potency testing and an increase in royalties on acthar net sales  offset by a decrease in the proportionate amount of distribution costs relative to net sales 
we continue to expect our cost of sales  in absolute dollars  to increase in future periods due to increased costs associated with outside product potency testing  product stability testing and  in the event of increased net sales  higher royalty payments 
the manufacturing process for acthar is complex and problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons  including equipment malfunction  failure to follow specific protocols and procedures  problems with raw materials  natural disasters  and environmental factors 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses were million for the year ended december   as compared to million in and million in the increase of million in as compared to is due primarily to increases in headcount related costs and costs associated with our expanded sales and marketing effort 
we primarily include in sales and marketing expenses headcount related costs  promotional costs and physician program costs 
we have expanded our sales force and expect selling and marketing expenses to increase in future periods 
the increase in selling and marketing expenses of million in as compared to was also due primarily to increases in headcount related costs and costs associated with our expanded sales and marketing effort 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   as compared to million in and million in the increase of million in as compared to  as well as the increase of million in as compared to  is due primarily to increases in headcount and headcount related costs to support our growth  including increased bonus compensation for our bonus eligible employees  and increased legal costs 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million in  as compared to million in and million in the increase of million in research and development expenses in as compared to was primarily due to increases in headcount and headcount related costs to support our efforts to explore the use of acthar as a therapeutic alternative for the treatment of ns and costs incurred associated with the following clinical studies the initiation of our phase dose response clinical trial for idiopathic membranous nephropathy  the initiation of our pilot safety and efficacy study of acthar in patients with diabetic nephropathy  and the initiation of our study exploring 
table of contents the efficacy  safety and pharmacodynamics of acthar in system lupus erythematosus 
costs included in research and development also include costs associated with the funding of medical research projects to better understand the therapeutic benefit of acthar in current and new therapeutic applications  product development efforts and regulatory compliance activities 
we manage and evaluate our research and development expenditures generally by the type of costs incurred 
we generally classify and separate research and development expenditures into amounts related to medical affairs  regulatory  product development and manufacturing costs 
such categories include the following types of costs medical affairs costs medical affairs costs  which include activities related to medical information in support of acthar and its related indications 
regulatory costs regulatory costs  which include compliance and all fda interactions 
product development costs product development costs  which include contract research organization costs and study monitoring costs 
manufacturing costs manufacturing costs  which include costs related to production scale up and validation  raw material qualification and stability studies 
for the year ended december   approximately of our research and development expenditures were for medical affairs costs  was spent on regulatory costs  was spent on product development costs  and approximately was spent on manufacturing costs 
for the year ended december   approximately of our research and development expenditures were for medical affairs costs  was spent on regulatory costs  was spent on product development costs  and approximately was spent on manufacturing costs 
for the year ended december   approximately of our research and development expenditures were for medical affairs costs  was spent on regulatory costs  was spent on product development costs  and approximately was spent on manufacturing costs 
we plan to continue to expand our research and development efforts to support the use of acthar as a therapeutic alternative for the treatment of ns 
in  we started a phase dose response clinical trial for idiopathic membranous nephropathy and in  we started a pilot safety and efficacy study of acthar in patients with diabetic nephropathy and proteinuria 
these clinical trials will result in a significant increase in research and development expenses through we may also pursue clinical trials to evaluate the use of acthar to treat other therapeutic uses  including conditions that are not currently on the label of approved indications for acthar 
the expenditures that will be necessary to execute our development plans are subject to numerous uncertainties  which may affect our research and development expenditures and capital resources 
for instance  the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly depending on a variety of factors including a trial protocol  the number of patients in the trial  the duration of patient follow up  the number of clinical sites in the trial  and the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects 
even if earlier results are positive  we may obtain different results in later stages of development  including failure to show the desired safety or efficacy  which could impact our development expenditures for a particular indication 
although we spend a considerable amount of time planning our development activities  we may be required to deviate from our plan based on new circumstances or events or our assessment from time to time of a particular indication market potential  other product opportunities and our corporate priorities 
any deviation from our plan may require us to incur additional expenditures or accelerate or delay the timing of our development spending 
furthermore  as we obtain results from trials and review the path toward regulatory approval  we may elect to discontinue development of certain indications or product candidates  in order to focus our resources on more promising indications or candidates 
as a result  the amount or ranges of cost and timing to complete our product development programs and each future product development program is not estimable 
share based compensation costs 
total share based compensation costs for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
this increase was primarily due to a significant increase in the number of employees participating in our equity compensation programs 
for the year ended december   we granted options to employees and non employee directors to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share  which was equal to the weighted average of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of each grant 
in addition to stock options  we also granted restricted stock awards to certain employees 
the total share based compensation costs related to these restricted stock awards for the years 
table of contents ended december   and were million   and  respectively 
the following table sets forth our share based compensation costs for the years ended december   and  respectively in thousands years ended december  selling and marketing general and administrative research and development total share based compensation expense total other income 
total other income for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million for and million for the increase in total other income of million in as compared to was the result of an increase in the average cash balances on hand for as compared to resulting in higher interest income 
the increase in total other income of million in as compared to was the result of an increase in miscellaneous income offset by a lower yield on our cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances year over year 
income tax expense 
income tax expense for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively  and our effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes was approximately  and  respectively 
the increase in our effective income tax rate in as compared to is due to an increase in nondeductible expense  the absence of research and development tax credits in  and the one time tax credit recorded in for the costs incurred in obtaining the orphan drug designation 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in as compared to is due to the reduction in our state income tax rate because beginning in  california allows for a single apportionment factor and most of our sales are sourced outside of california  and finally  we recorded a one time tax credit during for the costs incurred in obtaining the orphan drug designation 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and working capital as of december  and  respectively  were as follows in thousands financial assets years ended december  cash and cash equivalents short term investments cash  cash equivalents and short term investments select measures of liquidity and capital resources years ended december  current assets current liabilities working capital current ratio until required for use in our business or returned to shareholders through our dividend  share repurchase program or other method  we invest our cash reserves in money market funds and high quality commercial  corporate and us government and agency bonds in accordance with our investment policy 
the objective of our investment policy is to preserve capital  provide liquidity consistent with forecasted cash flow requirements  maintain appropriate diversification and generate returns relative to these investment objectives and prevailing market conditions 
the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments was primarily due to the repurchase of  shares of our common stock through our approved stock repurchase plan for million  offset by an increase in net sales 
table of contents and the related cash generated from operations 
the decrease in our working capital was primarily due to decreases in our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  offset by increases in our accounts receivable  inventories  and sales related reserves 
our collection terms on our accounts receivable are net days  with approximately of our accounts receivable and net sales generated by our distributor for acthar  curascript sd  which in turn sells acthar primarily to specialty pharmacies 
we expect continued growth in our research and development expenses 
however  we anticipate that cash generated from operations and our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments should provide us adequate resources to fund our operations as currently planned for the foreseeable future

we review our level of liquidity and anticipated cash needs for the business on an ongoing basis  and consider whether to return additional capital to our shareholders as well as alternative methods to return capital 
historically  our primary method of returning capital to shareholders has been open market share repurchases and dividend payments

annual rent expense for all of our facilities  equipment and automobile leases for the year ended december  was approximately million 
we lease  square feet of laboratory and office space in hayward  california under a master lease that expires in may this facility is occupied by our commercial development  sales and marketing  medical affairs  contract manufacturing  quality control and quality assurance departments 
we lease  square feet of office space in ellicott city  maryland under a lease agreement that expires in october this facility is occupied by our product development and regulatory affairs departments 
we lease  square feet of office space in anaheim  california under a lease agreement that expires in october this facility is occupied by our executive  finance and administration departments  and serves as our corporate headquarters 
during the year ended december   we entered into an agreement with csl behring llc  or csl behring  to provide potency and toxicity testing on acthar prior to releasing the product for commercial distribution 
beginning on january   the agreement provides for a maximum number of tests to be performed each year 
tests performed in excess of the maximum are to be paid on a per test basis 
we have been in compliance with the terms of our agreement with csl behring 
critical accounting policies and estimates we base our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  upon our consolidated financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
we describe our significant accounting policies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we include within these policies our critical accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are those policies that are most important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and require management s most subjective and complex judgment due to the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
changes in estimates and assumptions based upon actual results may have a material impact on our results of operations and or financial condition 
we believe that the critical accounting policies that most impact the consolidated financial statements are described below 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting standards codification  revenue recognition products  or asc  from sales of acthar and doral 
pursuant to asc  we recognize revenue when we have persuasive evidence that an arrangement  agreement or contract exists  when title for our product and risk of loss have passed to our customers  the price we charge for our product is fixed or is readily determinable  and we are reasonably assured of collecting the amounts owed under the resulting receivable 
for sales of both of our products  we do not require collateral from our customers 
in order to ensure that patients who need acthar are able to obtain it regardless of ability to pay  we also support the patient assistance programs administered by the national organization of rare disorders  or nord  and the chronic disease fund by providing free drug with a commercial value of over million to patients from september through december  we do not recognize any revenue from our free drug program 

table of contents in the united states  our exclusive customer for acthar is curascript sd 
for our sales to curascript sd  a sale of acthar occurs when curascript sd accepts a shipment of acthar 
we sell acthar at a discount from our list price to curascript sd  which then sells acthar primarily to approximately specialty pharmacies  including curascript sp  and to many hospitals 
we sell doral to pharmaceutical wholesalers  which in turn sell doral primarily to retail pharmacies and hospitals 
international sales of our products are immaterial 
net sales we record net sales after establishing reserves for the following medicaid rebates  tricare retail program rebates  medicare part d coverage gap discount program rebates  chargebacks due to other government programs  questcor sponsored co pay assistance programs  returns  which have historically been immaterial  and other deductions such as payment discounts 
we currently provide our products to medicaid participants under an agreement with the center for medicare and medicaid services  or cms 
under this agreement  states are eligible to receive rebates from us for medicaid patients in accordance with cms regulations 
for the years ended december   and  the rebate amount equaled of the average manufacturer price  or amp  of acthar which approximates the amount we charge to curascript sd 
during the first quarter of  the medicaid rebate amount for acthar was reset from of the amp of acthar to the basic rebate of of amp 
states have historically provided us with rebate invoices for their medicaid fee for service reimbursements between to days after the end of the calendar quarter in which our products were provided 
certain states are taking longer to submit their initial rebate invoices for the medicaid managed care organization utilization that became rebate eligible on march   as a result of the enactment of the health care reform acts 
we estimate the end of period liability and the sales reserve needed for these medicaid rebates based on the following multi step process using a predictive model  we review national medicaid statistics as well as internal information received from our acthar reimbursement support center and from curascript sp for the most recent completed quarter to develop an estimate of future medicaid rebate invoices that we expect to receive 
this includes an estimate for future medicaid fee for service and medicaid managed care organization rebate invoices 
we review the medicaid rebate invoices received during the last days and compare those invoices to the reserve that we had previously set at the end of the prior quarter 
based on this comparison and using the predictive model and other available information  which is updated quarterly  we estimate the remaining liability that we believe is still outstanding for periods prior to the most recently completed quarter 
based on estimated end of quarter inventory held at curascript sd  all specialty pharmacies and hospitals  we calculate the expected future rebate liability for that portion of the estimated distribution channel inventory which will eventually be used to fill prescriptions for medicaid patients 
using similar processes  we estimate the end of period liability and the sales reserve needed for tricare retail program rebates  medicare part d coverage gap discount program rebates  or coverage gap discount rebates commonly referred to as the medicare part d donut hole  and chargebacks due to other government programs 
the coverage gap discount program took effect on january  we do not believe this program has or will have a material effect on our cash flows or results of operations 
our resulting total sales reserve includes the sum of the medicaid sales reserve  the tricare sales reserve  the coverage gap discount reserve  the chargeback sales reserve  co pay assistance payments  and payment discounts provided 
significant judgment is inherent in the selection of assumptions and the interpretation of historical experience as well as the identification of external and internal factors affecting the determination of our reserves for medicaid rebates and other government program rebates and chargebacks 
we believe that the assumptions used to determine these sales reserves are reasonable considering known facts and circumstances 
however  our medicaid rebates and other government program rebates and chargebacks could materially differ from our reserve amounts because of unanticipated changes in prescription trends or patterns in the states submissions of medicaid claims  adjustments to the amount of product in the distribution channel  or if 
table of contents our estimates of the number of medicaid patients with is  ms  ns and rheumatology related conditions are incorrect 
we have greater visibility on the future submission of medicaid claims and the amount of product in the distribution channel for acthar distributed to curascript sp which is owned by curascript sd than we have with respect to acthar distributed through other specialty pharmacies 
if actual medicaid rebates  or other government program rebates and chargebacks are materially different from our estimates  we would account for such differences as a change in estimate in the period in which they become known 
if actual future payments for such reserves exceed the estimates we made at the time of sale  our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows may be negatively impacted 
the following table summarizes the activity in the account for sales related reserves for medicaid rebates in thousands years ended december  balance at january actual medicaid rebate payments for sales made in prior year actual medicaid rebate payments for sales made in current year current medicaid rebate provision for sales made in prior year current medicaid rebate provision for sales made in current year balance at december tricare retail pharmacy programs the department of defense  or dod  tricare retail pharmacy program became effective on may  pursuant to section of the national defense authorization act of this program and its regulations require manufacturers to pay rebates  retroactive to january   to the dod on products distributed to tricare beneficiaries through retail pharmacies 
the regulations further require that pharmaceutical products paid for by the dod through the tricare retail pharmacy program be subject to the federal ceiling price program  which requires manufacturers to provide the dod with a refund on pharmaceutical products utilized through the tricare retail pharmacy program 
as a result  we established a sales reserve of million for tricare rebates as of the year ended december   which covered of our estimated liability for the time period january  through december  in late october  the united states district court for the district of columbia issued its decision in coalition for common sense in government procurement v 
united states  no

 upholding the dod regulation 
during the year ended december   we paid million for the periods january  through june  we believe our residual reserve of million is sufficient to cover the remaining period of july  through december  the following table summarizes the activity in the account for sales related reserves for tricare rebates in thousands years ended december  balance at january actual tricare rebate payments for sales made in prior year actual tricare rebate payments for sales made in current year current tricare rebate provision for sales made in prior year current tricare rebate provision for sales made in current year balance at december government chargebacks we permit certain other government supported entities  such as those covered by our contract with the veterans administration or eligible public health service  or phs  b entities  to purchase acthar from curascript sd based on a contractual amount 
because our payment terms with curascript sd are net days  we include actual chargebacks taken plus an estimate applied to the units in channel when estimating the sales reserve related to government chargebacks 
sales to the veterans administration and phs b entities are generally immaterial to our financial position as a whole 
co pay assistance programs 
table of contents we sponsor co pay assistance programs for acthar patients that are administered by the chronic disease fund 
we account for these co pay assistance program payments as a reduction to our revenue 
total sales related reserves at december  and  respectively  sales related reserves included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were as follows in thousands december  medicaid rebates tricare rebates coverage gap discount program rebates government chargebacks other discounts total inventories we state inventories  net of allowances  at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined by the first in  first to expire method 
we review inventory periodically for slow moving or obsolete status 
we adjust our inventory if we do not expect to recover the cost of inventory 
we would record a reserve to adjust inventory to its net realizable value i when a product is close to expiration and we do not expect it to be sold  ii when a product has reached its expiration date or iii when we do not expect a product to be saleable 
in determining the reserves for our products  we consider factors such as the amount of inventory on hand and its remaining shelf life  and current and expected market conditions  including management forecasts and levels of competition 
we have evaluated the current level of inventory and based on our evaluation have recorded adjustments to reflect inventory at its net realizable value 
these adjustments are estimates  which could vary significantly from actual results if future economic conditions  customer demand  competition or other relevant factors differ from expectations 
these estimates require us to assess the future demand for our products in order to categorize the status of such inventory items as slow moving  obsolete or in excess of need 
these future estimates are subject to the ongoing accuracy of our forecasts of market conditions  industry trends  competition and other factors 
differences between our estimated reserves and actual inventory adjustments have been immaterial  and we account for such adjustments in the current period as a change in estimate 
share based compensation we recognize compensation expense for all share based awards made to employees and directors 
the fair value of share based awards is estimated at grant date using an option pricing model and the portion that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as compensation cost over either the requisite service period or the performance period 
since share based compensation is recognized only for those awards that are ultimately expected to vest  we have applied an estimated forfeiture rate to unvested awards for the purpose of calculating compensation cost 
these estimates will be revised  if necessary  in future periods if actual forfeitures differ from estimates 
changes in forfeiture estimates impact compensation cost in the period in which the change in estimate occurs 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of share based awards 
the determination of fair value using the black scholes option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables  including expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  expected dividends and projected employee stock option behaviors 
we estimate the expected term based on the contractual term of the awards and employees exercise and expected post vesting termination behavior 
we use the intrinsic method to account for restricted stock awards 
the restricted stock awards are valued based on the closing stock price on the date of grant and amortized ratably over the life of the award 
additionally  we are required to disclose in our consolidated statements of cash flows the income tax effects resulting from share based payment arrangements 
we adopted the simplified method to calculate the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital  or apic  pool of excess tax benefits  and to determine the subsequent effect on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of employee share based compensation awards 

table of contents at december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock awards and million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options  which is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted average vesting period of approximately years 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the provisions of accounting standards codification  income taxes  or asc we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our tax exposure under the most current tax laws and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
utilization of our net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards may still be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions for ownership changes after december  such annual limitations could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards available as of december  before utilization 
income tax expense for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively  and our effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes was approximately  and  respectively 
the increase in our effective income tax rate in as compared to is due to an increase in nondeductible expense  the absence of research and development tax credits in  and the one time tax credit recorded in for the costs incurred in obtaining the orphan drug designation 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in as compared to is due to the reduction in our state income tax rate because beginning in  california allows for a single apportionment factor and most of our sales are sourced outside of california  and finally  we recorded a one time tax credit during for the costs incurred in obtaining the orphan drug designation 
as of december   we have recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million related to various federal and state income tax matters 
our policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense 
for the years ended december   and  interest and penalties were recorded for unrecognized tax benefits of   and  respectively 
as of december  and  our accrual for interest and penalties on any unrecognized tax benefits was  and  respectively 
we do not expect unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next months 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued accounting standards update no 
intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  or asu no 
asu no 
applies to testing the decline in realizable value of indefinite lived intangibles other than goodwill  and applies to all public  private  and not for profit organizations 
asu no 
allows an organization the option of first assessing qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative impairment test of the indefinite lived intangible asset is necessary 
if the qualitative assessment reveals that it s more likely than not that the asset is impaired  a calculation of the asset s fair value is required 
otherwise  no quantitative calculation is necessary 
fasb s previous guidance required an organization to compare the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset with its carrying amount at least annually to test for impairment 
if the asset s carrying amount exceeded its fair value  the difference was recognized as an impairment loss 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after sept 
 early adoption is permitted 
we plan to adopt asu no 
for fiscal year december  and do not anticipate a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market rate risk the primary objective of our investment policy is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in had market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later increases  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
in an attempt to limit interest rate risk  we 
table of contents follow guidelines to limit the average and longest single maturity dates 
our investments include money market accounts  government sponsored enterprises  certificates of deposit and municipal bonds 
none of our investments are in auction rate securities 
seeking to minimize credit risk  we place our investments with high quality issuers and follow internally developed guidelines to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
international sales of our products are immaterial 
accordingly  we have not had any exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
however  with the acquisition of biovectra in january  international sales as a component of our total sales will increase and we will have increased exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations
