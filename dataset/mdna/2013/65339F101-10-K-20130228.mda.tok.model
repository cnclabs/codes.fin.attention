table of contents adjusted earnings nee prepares its financial statements in accordance with gaap 
however  management uses earnings excluding certain items adjusted earnings  a non gaap financial measure  internally for financial planning  for analysis of performance  for reporting of results to the board of directors and as an input in determining whether performance goals are met for performance based compensation under nee s employee incentive compensation plans 
nee also uses adjusted earnings when communicating its financial results and earnings outlook to investors 
nee s management believes adjusted earnings provides a more meaningful representation of the company s fundamental earnings power 
although the excluded amounts are properly included in the determination of net income in accordance with gaap  management believes that the amount and or nature of such items make period to period comparisons of operations difficult and potentially confusing 
adjusted earnings do not represent a substitute for net income  as prepared in accordance with gaap 
adjusted earnings exclude the unrealized mark to market effect of non qualifying hedges as described below and otti losses on securities held in neer s nuclear decommissioning funds  net of the reversal of previously recognized otti losses on securities sold and losses on securities where price recovery was deemed unlikely collectively  otti reversals 
however  other adjustments may be made from time to time with the intent to provide more meaningful and comparable results of ongoing operations 
in  adjusted earnings also excluded the after tax loss on the sale of natural gas fired generating assets as described below 
nee and neer segregate into two categories unrealized mark to market gains and losses on energy derivative transactions which are used to manage commodity price risk 
the first category  referred to as non qualifying hedges  represents certain transactions entered into as economic hedges but the transactions do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting or hedge accounting treatment is not elected 
changes in the fair value of those transactions are marked to market and reported in the consolidated statements of income  resulting in earnings volatility because the economic offset to the positions  such as the physical assets from which power is generated  are not marked to market 
as a consequence  nee net income reflects only the movement in one part of economically linked transactions 
for this reason  nee management views results expressed excluding the unrealized mark to market impact of the non qualifying hedges as a meaningful measure of current period performance 
the second category  referred to as trading activities  which is included in adjusted earnings  represents the net unrealized effect of actively traded positions entered into to take advantage of expected market price movements and all other commodity hedging activities 
at fpl  substantially all changes in the fair value of energy derivative transactions are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled  and  upon settlement  any gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause or the capacity clause 
see note in late  subsidiaries of neer completed the sales of their ownership interests in five natural gas fired generating plants with a total generating capacity of approximately  mw located in california  virginia  alabama  south carolina and rhode island 
in connection with these sales  a loss of approximately million million total after tax with million of this loss recorded by neer was recorded in nee consolidated statements of income  which was excluded from adjusted earnings 
see note nonrecurring fair value measurements 
in late  a subsidiary of neer entered into an agreement to sell its ownership interest in a portfolio of hydropower generation plants and related assets with a total generating capacity of mw located in maine and new hampshire 
upon the anticipated closing in the first quarter of  neer expects to record a gain which is expected to be excluded from adjusted earnings 
the operations of these projects were not material to nee consolidated statements of income for the years ended december   and and the transaction is not expected to have a material effect on ongoing future financial results 
see note assets and liabilities associated with assets held for sale 
the following table provides details of the adjustments considered in computing nee adjusted earnings discussed above 
years ended december  millions net unrealized mark to market after tax gains losses from non qualifying hedge activity a income loss from otti after tax losses on securities held in neer nuclear decommissioning funds  net of otti reversals after tax loss on sale of natural gas fired generating assets b a million of losses  million of gains and million of gains  respectively  are included in neer net income  the balance is included in corporate and other 
b million is included in neer net income  the balance is included in corporate and other 
the change in unrealized mark to market activity from non qualifying hedges is primarily attributable to changes in forward power and natural gas prices  as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized mark to market gains or losses as the underlying transactions were realized 
as a general rule  a gain loss in the non qualifying hedge category is offset by decreases increases in the fair value of related physical asset positions in the portfolio or contracts  which are not marked to market under gaap 

table of contents summary nee net income for was million  or cents per share  lower than primarily due to lower results at corporate and other and neer  partly offset by higher earnings at fpl 
fpl increase in net income in was primarily driven by investments in plant in service which resulted in higher use of fpl surplus depreciation credit  as permitted under the rate agreement  to earn an regulatory roe on its retail rate base  as well as higher cost recovery clause results and higher afudc equity 
the rate agreement was effective through december  see outlook below for a discussion of the rate agreement 
fpl planned smart meter installations throughout florida are approximately complete  with a cumulative total of million smart meters installed 
in  fpl maintained a typical residential bill that was the lowest of all utilities in florida and below the national average based on a rate per kwh as of july neer earnings decreased in primarily due to net unrealized mark to market losses from non qualifying hedge activity in compared to gains on such hedges in and lower results from the existing asset portfolio  partly offset by the absence of the loss on sale of natural gas fired generating assets and impairment charges recorded in and higher results in from new investments and the customer supply and proprietary power and gas trading businesses 
in  neer added over  mw of wind capacity  including its first wind project in the province of ontario  canada  and placed its  th mw of wind capacity into service 
corporate and other earnings in decreased primarily due to the absence of state deferred income tax benefits related to state tax law changes and an income tax benefit related to the dissolution of a subsidiary recorded in nee and its subsidiaries  including fpl  require funds to support and grow their businesses 
these funds are primarily provided by cash flow from operations and short and long term borrowings and  from time to time  issuance of equity securities 
as of february   nee total net available liquidity was approximately billion  of which fpl portion was approximately billion 
outlook fpl rate agreement provides  among other things  base rate predictability through december  including allowances for rate increases when the modernized cape canaveral  rivera beach and port everglades power plants are placed in service  and  as discussed in more detail below  permits fpl to amortize the reserve up to million over the to period 
fpl allowed regulatory roe over this period will be  with a range of plus or minus basis points 
nee strategy at both of its principal businesses seeks to meet customer needs more economically and reliably than competitors 
meeting customer needs frequently requires the commitment of large capital expenditures to projects that have long lives and such commitments are difficult to reverse once made 
both fpl and neer have made commitments to a variety of major capital projects that are expected to be completed over the next several years 
while nee management believes that these projects individually and collectively are attractive investments with the potential to create value for shareholders  there can be no guarantee that all or any of these projects will be successful 
because of their importance  management focuses particular attention on these large projects 
in  nee expects to focus efforts in particular on the following initiatives at fpl sustaining fpl customer value proposition the combination of low bills  good reliability and excellent customer service that fpl currently provides its customers is both an objective of fpl strategy and an important contributor to its long term business success 
fpl seeks to  at a minimum  maintain and ideally improve its overall customer value proposition 
major capital projects fpl is currently engaged in a large capital expansion program and its objective is to bring these projects in on schedule and within budget 
this program includes modernizing its cape canaveral  riviera beach and port everglades power plants to high efficiency natural gas fired units approximately  mw each at cape canaveral and riviera beach and  mw at port everglades to be placed in service by june  june and mid  respectively  and adding at least mw of capacity at its existing nuclear units at st 
lucie and turkey point  to be placed in service by the spring of  of which approximately mw are in service as of december  
table of contents natural gas pipeline in december  fpl issued an rfp to build a third major natural gas pipeline to serve peninsular florida 
the proposed new pipeline will have an upstream segment which originates at an existing hub in western alabama and ends at a new hub to be built in central florida 
the downstream segment will originate at the new hub in central florida and connect with fpl system in martin county 
fpl plans to propose a self build option for the downstream segment of the pipeline  which  if selected  is expected to be built  owned and operated by a ferc regulated affiliate 
the ferc regulated affiliate is prepared to consider investing in support of a selected upstream segment to facilitate timely construction 
the bids are due in april  with the winning proposal s expected to be selected by the end of june the pipeline will be subject to regulatory approvals 
at neer maintaining excellence in day to day operations neer has developed a track record of generally running its facilities reliably and cost effectively 
the company seeks to  at minimum  maintain and ideally improve its operating performance 
solar add nearly mw of new solar generation by  including the completion of the construction of the spain solar projects in see note commitments for recent changes in law that could negatively affect the spain solar projects  the mw genesis solar project in california  the mw desert sunlight solar project in california  in which neer has a equity investment  and the mw mccoy solar pv project located in the mojave desert near the genesis and desert sunlight solar projects 
wind add approximately mw of new canadian wind generation by the end of and mw of new us wind generation in continue to develop a backlog for us wind for and in light of the ptc extension under the taxpayer relief act 
at lone star achieve commercial operations by the end of the first quarter of on approximately miles of transmission lines and other associated facilities in texas 
in addition  nee and fpl devote effort to numerous other initiatives designed to support their long term growth and development 
there can be no guarantees that nee or fpl will be successful in attaining their goals with respect to any of these initiatives 
for additional information on certain of the above matters  see item business 
results of operations nee s net income for was billion  compared to billion in and billion in the decrease in net income was primarily due to the absence of certain income tax benefits at corporate and other recorded in and lower results at neer  partly offset by improved results at fpl 
the decrease in nee s net income was primarily driven by lower earnings at neer  partly offset by improved results at fpl and income tax benefits at corporate and other 
nee effective income tax rate for all periods presented reflects ptcs for wind projects at neer and deferred income tax benefits associated with convertible itcs under the american recovery and reinvestment act of recovery act 
ptcs and deferred income tax benefits associated with convertible itcs can significantly affect nee effective income tax rate depending on the amount of pretax income 
ptcs can be significantly affected by wind generation and by the roll off of ptcs on certain wind projects after ten years of production ptc roll off

fpl obtains its operating revenues primarily from the sale of electricity to retail customers at rates established by the fpsc through base rates and cost recovery clause mechanisms 
in through  fpl earned a regulatory roe of  as permitted by the rate agreement 
in and in  growth in earnings for fpl was driven by investment in plant in service which resulted in higher use of fpl surplus depreciation credit to earn an regulatory roe on its retail rate base  higher cost recovery clause results  and for  higher afudc equity

table of contents fpl operating revenues consisted of the following years ended december  millions retail base fuel cost recovery net deferral of retail fuel revenues net repayment of previously deferred retail fuel revenues other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs  net of any deferrals other  primarily pole attachment rentals  transmission and wholesale sales and customer related fees total retail base as permitted by the rate agreement  in and  fpl collected approximately million and million  respectively  in additional retail base revenues through the capacity clause related to the placement in service of wcec unit no 
in may also included in retail base revenues were approximately million of unbilled revenues associated with new retail base rates under the rate agreement see fpsc rate orders below  which were billed in additional base revenues of approximately million were collected in related to new nuclear capacity which was placed in service in  as permitted by the fpsc nuclear cost recovery rule 
in  fpl expects to collect approximately million of additional base revenues related to new nuclear capacity of approximately mw  which was placed in service in a base rate increase pursuant to the fpsc rate order increased retail base revenues by approximately million 
fpsc rate orders during the period to  fpl base rates were established by the fpsc rate order and the rate agreement which  among other things  during this period provided an approximately million base rate increase on an annualized basis  effective march   and permitted fpl to vary the amount of surplus depreciation credit taken in any calendar year up to certain limits  provided that in any year of the rate agreement fpl was required to use enough surplus depreciation credit to maintain an earned regulatory roe within the range of 
during  and  fpl recorded million  million and million of surplus depreciation credit 
see item business fpl fpl regulation for additional information on the fpsc rate order and the rate agreement 
effective january through december  fpl base rates will be determined by the rate agreement  which was approved by the fpsc in january key elements of the rate agreement include  among other things  the following new retail base rates and charges were established in january resulting in an increase in retail base revenues of million on an annualized basis 
fpl allowed regulatory roe will be  with a range of plus or minus basis points 
if fpl earned regulatory roe falls below  fpl may seek retail base rate relief 
if the earned regulatory roe rises above  any party to the rate agreement other than fpl may seek a review of fpl retail base rates 
retail base rates will be increased by the annualized base revenue requirements for fpl three modernization projects cape canaveral  riviera beach and port everglades as each of the modernized power plants becomes operational which is expected by june  june and mid  respectively 
cost recovery of wcec unit no 
 which was placed in service in may  will continue to occur through the capacity clause  however  such recovery will not be limited to the projected annual fuel cost savings as was the case in the previous rate agreement 
subject to certain conditions  fpl must amortize  over the term of the rate agreement  a depreciation reserve surplus remaining at the end of under the rate order approximately million and may amortize a portion of fpl fossil dismantlement reserve up to a maximum of million collectively  the reserve  provided that in any year of the rate agreement  fpl must amortize at least enough reserve to maintain a earned regulatory roe but may not amortize any reserve that would result in an earned regulatory roe in excess of 
the reserve will be amortized as a reduction of regulatory liabilities accrued asset removal costs on nee and fpl consolidated balance sheets 
future storm restoration costs would be recoverable on an interim basis beginning days from the filing of a cost recovery petition  but capped at an amount that could produce a surcharge of no more than for every  kwh of usage on residential bills during the first months of cost recovery 
any additional costs would be eligible for recovery in subsequent years 
if storm restoration costs exceed million in any given calendar year  fpl may request an increase to the surcharge to recover the amount above million 

table of contents on february   the office of public counsel filed a notice of appeal to the florida supreme court of the fpsc final order regarding the rate agreement 
retail customer usage and growth in each of the years ended december  and  fpl experienced a decrease in average usage per retail customer  primarily due to weather conditions partly offset in by higher non weather related usage per retail customer  which decreased retail base revenues by approximately million and million  respectively 
the usage per retail customer data for the year ended december  includes three extra days of sales after adjusting for a change from a fiscal month to a calendar month 
for both years ended december  and  fpl experienced a increase in the average number of customer accounts  increasing retail base revenues by approximately million and million  respectively 
non weather related usage per retail customer increased in mirroring the continued gradual improvements in the florida economy 
as of december  florida has experienced consecutive months of positive year over year employment growth 
the state unemployment rate has fallen from a high of in january to in december the number of empty homes in fpl service area is also gradually declining 
the number of inactive meters premises where electric service is available but no customer is requesting electric service declined by in while the number of low usage accounts decreased by 
at the same time  higher energy efficiencies are offsetting some of the increase in non weather related usage per retail customer resulting from the improved economic outlook 
fpl has now experienced three consecutive years of moderately positive growth in the average number of customer accounts 
some improvement in the rate of customer growth is expected in  assuming no significant decline in the overall state of florida economy 
cost recovery clauses revenues from fuel and other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs  such as franchise fees  revenue taxes and storm related surcharges  are largely a pass through of costs 
such revenues also include a return on investment allowed to be recovered through the cost recovery clauses on certain assets  primarily related to nuclear capacity  solar and environmental projects 
in  and  cost recovery clauses contributed million  million and million  respectively  to fpl s net income 
the increase in in cost recovery clause results was primarily due to a return related to additional nuclear capacity investments  while the increase in reflects a return related to additional solar  environmental and nuclear capacity investments 
in  it is expected that earnings from cost recovery clauses will decline primarily as a result of the collection in of retail base revenues related to new nuclear capacity which was placed in service in see retail base above 
fluctuations in fuel cost recovery revenues are primarily driven by changes in fuel and energy charges which are included in fuel  purchased power and interchange expense in the consolidated statements of income  as well as by changes in energy sales 
fluctuations in revenues from other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs are primarily driven by changes in storm related surcharges  capacity charges  franchise fee costs  the impact of changes in o m and depreciation expenses on the underlying cost recovery clause  investment in solar and environmental projects  investment in nuclear capacity until such capacity goes into service and is recovered in base rates  pre construction costs associated with the development of two additional nuclear units at the turkey point site and changes in energy sales 
capacity charges and franchise fee costs are included in fuel  purchased power and interchange and taxes other than income taxes and other  respectively  in the consolidated statements of income 
underrecovery or overrecovery of cost recovery clause and other pass through costs can significantly affect nextera energy and fpl operating cash flows 
the change from december  to december  in deferred clause and franchise expenses and in deferred clause and franchise revenues was approximately million and positively affected nee s and fpl s cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december  risk management fuel procurement program fpl uses a risk management fuel procurement program which was approved by the fpsc 
the fpsc reviews the program activities and results for prudence on an annual basis as part of its annual review of fuel costs 
the program is intended to manage fuel price volatility by locking in fuel prices for a portion of fpl s fuel requirements 
the current regulatory asset for the change in fair value of derivative instruments used in the fuel procurement program was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in fuel cost recovery revenues in is primarily due to a lower average fuel factor of approximately million and lower energy sales of million 
the increase in fuel cost recovery revenues in reflects the absence of a million one time credit to retail customers bills made in pursuant to an fpsc order  partly offset by approximately million related to lower energy sales and million related to a lower average fuel factor 

table of contents other the increase in revenues from other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs in is primarily due to higher revenues associated with the fpsc s nuclear cost recovery rule reflective of higher earnings on additional nuclear capacity investments 
the nuclear cost recovery rule provides for the recovery of prudently incurred pre construction costs and carrying charges equal to a fixed pretax afudc rate on construction costs and a return on investment for new nuclear capacity through levelized charges under the capacity clause 
the same rule provides for the recovery of construction costs  once property related to the new nuclear capacity goes into service  through a base rate increase effective beginning the following january 
other items impacting fpl results fuel  purchased power and interchange the major components of fpl fuel  purchased power and interchange expense are as follows years ended december  millions fuel and energy charges during the period net collection of previously deferred retail fuel costs net deferral of retail fuel costs other  primarily capacity charges  net of any capacity deferral total the decrease in fuel and energy charges in reflects lower fuel and energy prices of million and lower energy sales of million 
the decrease in fuel and energy charges in reflects lower fuel and energy prices of approximately million and lower energy sales of million 
o m expenses fpl o m expenses increased million in primarily due to higher employee related and insurance costs  as well as higher fossil plant outage costs primarily due to timing 
also  fpl o m expenses in reflect higher cost recovery clause costs of approximately million  which did not significantly affect net income 
fpl s o m expenses increased million in primarily due to higher cost recovery clause costs 
depreciation and amortization expense the major components of fpl s depreciation and amortization expense are as follows years ended december  millions surplus depreciation credit recorded under the rate agreement other depreciation and amortization recovered under base rates depreciation and amortization recovered under cost recovery clauses and securitized storm recovery cost amortization total under the terms of the rate agreement  fpl could vary the amount of surplus depreciation credit taken in any calendar year up to a cap in of million  a cap in subsequent years of million plus the amount of any unused portion from prior years  and a cap of million over the to period 
see fpsc rate orders above for additional information on the use of the remaining depreciation reserve surplus 
the increase in surplus depreciation credit recorded under the rate agreement in and is primarily a result of increased plant investment and enabled fpl to earn its regulatory roe 
the increase in other depreciation and amortization expense recovered under base rates in and is primarily due to higher plant in service balances 
the increase in depreciation and amortization recovered under cost recovery clauses and securitized storm recovery cost amortization in is primarily due to true ups of prior year recoveries under the fpsc nuclear cost recovery rule  while the decrease in such depreciation in is primarily due to lower depreciation and amortization under the fpsc nuclear cost recovery rule 
see note electric plant  depreciation and amortization 
taxes other than income taxes and other taxes other than income taxes and other decreased million in primarily due to lower franchise fees and revenue taxes collectively  million  both of which are pass through costs and reflect the decrease in fuel cost recovery clause revenues  partly offset by higher property taxes of million reflecting growth in plant in service balances 
the increase in of million was primarily due to higher franchise fees and revenue taxes  reflecting the increase in revenues from fuel and other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs  and higher property taxes of million reflecting growth in plant in service balances partly offset by a lower average property tax rate 

table of contents interest expense the increase in interest expense in is primarily due to higher average debt balances  partly offset by lower average interest rates  lower interest expense on customer deposits reflecting lower rates and lower average customer deposit balances and higher afudc debt 
the change in afudc debt is due to the same factors as described below in afudc equity 
the increase in interest expense in is primarily due to higher average interest rates and higher average debt balances 
interest expense on storm recovery bonds  as well as certain other interest expense on clause recoverable investments collectively  clause interest  are essentially pass through amounts and do not significantly affect net income  as the clause interest is recovered either under cost recovery clause mechanisms or through a storm recovery bond surcharge 
clause interest for  and amounted to approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in clause interest in and is primarily due to higher interest associated with nuclear capacity and environmental investments and  in  also reflects higher interest associated with solar investments 
afudc equity the increase in afudc equity in is primarily due to additional afudc equity on the cape canaveral and riviera beach modernization projects  partly offset by the absence of afudc equity on wcec unit no

table of contents corporate and other results of operations corporate and other is primarily comprised of interest expense  the operating results of neet  fpl fibernet and other business activities  as well as corporate interest income and expenses 
corporate and other allocates non utility interest expense and shared service costs to neer 
interest expense is allocated based on a deemed capital structure of debt and  for purposes of allocating non utility interest expense  the liability associated with differential membership interests sold by neer s subsidiaries is included with debt 
each subsidiary s income taxes are calculated based on the separate return method  except that tax benefits that could not be used on a separate return basis  but are used on the consolidated tax return  are recorded by the subsidiary that generated the tax benefits 
any remaining consolidated income tax benefits or expenses are recorded at corporate and other 
the major components of corporate and other s results  on an after tax basis  are as follows years ended december  millions interest expense  net of allocations to neer interest income federal and state income tax benefits other net income loss the increase in interest expense in and reflects higher average debt balances and  in  a lower allocation of interest costs to neer  as neer obtained additional project specific financing  partly offset by lower average interest rates 
the decline in interest income in is primarily due to lower interest recorded on unrecognized tax benefits  reflecting the settlement with the internal revenue service in see note unrecognized tax benefits 
the federal and state income tax benefits reflect consolidating income tax adjustments and include the following items in  a state deferred income tax benefit of approximately million  net of federal income taxes  related to state tax law changes  in  an income tax benefit of million related to the dissolution of a subsidiary  in  a million expense associated with the loss on sale of natural gas fired generating assets  and in  an income tax benefit of million related to employee benefits 
other includes all other corporate income and expenses  as well as other business activities 
the decline in other in is primarily due to approximately million of after tax investment losses  including an impairment charge on an early stage technology investment  a million after tax loss on the redemption in of neech junior subordinated debentures  as well as other corporate costs  partly offset by higher results from other business activities 
the pretax amount of the impairment charge on the early stage technology investment and the loss on the redemption of neech junior subordinated debentures collectively amounted to approximately million and is reflected in other net in nee consolidated statements of income 
the increase in other in is primarily due to the absence of an million after tax loss recorded in on the sale of assets held under leveraged leases  the pretax amount million of such loss is reflected in other net in nee consolidated statements of income 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources nee and its subsidiaries  including fpl  require funds to support and grow their businesses 
these funds are used for  among other things  working capital  capital expenditures  investments in or acquisitions of assets and businesses  payment of maturing debt obligations and  from time to time  redemption or repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities 
it is anticipated that these requirements will be satisfied through a combination of cash flow from operations  short and long term borrowings  and the issuance  from time to time  of short and long term debt and equity securities  consistent with nee s and fpl s objective of maintaining  on a long term basis  a capital structure that will support a strong investment grade credit rating 
nee  fpl and neech rely on access to credit and capital markets as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements and other operations that are not satisfied by operating cash flows 
the inability of nee  fpl and neech to maintain their current credit ratings could affect their ability to raise short and long term capital  their cost of capital and the execution of their respective financing strategies  and could require the posting of additional collateral under certain agreements

pursuant to a guarantee agreement  nee guarantees the payment of neech s debt obligations under the revolving credit facilities 
in order for fpl or neech to borrow or to have letters of credit issued under the terms of their respective revolving credit facilities  fpl  in the case of fpl  and nee  in the case of neech  are required  among other things  to maintain a ratio of funded debt to total capitalization that does not exceed a stated ratio 
the fpl and neech revolving credit facilities also contain default and related acceleration provisions relating to  among other things  failure of fpl and nee  as the case may be  to maintain the respective ratio of funded debt to total capitalization at or below the specified ratio

dodd frank act the dodd frank act  enacted into law in july  among other things  provides for substantially increased regulation of otc derivatives markets 
the dodd frank act includes provisions that will require certain otc derivatives  or swaps  to be centrally cleared and executed through an exchange or other approved trading platform 
while the legislation is broad and detailed  substantial portions of the legislation require implementing rules to be adopted by federal governmental agencies including  but not limited to  the sec and the cftc 
nee and fpl continue to monitor the development of rules related to the dodd frank act and are taking steps to comply with those rules that affect their businesses 
a number of rules have already been finalized and have become or will become effective over the next ten months 
the rule related to the definition of a swap was effective in october  which triggered formal effective dates for a number of other rules that are dependent on the definition of a swap over the next ten months  including the reporting and recordkeeping obligations applicable to derivative end users such as nee and fpl 
the implementation of these rules is not expected to have a material effect on nee and fpl  however  it is expected to add cost and compliance risk related to hedging activities 
the rules related to collateral requirements have not been finalized 
if those rules  when finalized  require nee and fpl to post significant amounts of cash collateral with respect to swap transactions  nee and fpl liquidity could be materially affected 
nee and fpl cannot predict the impact these new rules will have on their ability to hedge their commodity and interest rate risks or on otc derivatives markets as a whole  but management believes that they could potentially have a material effect on nee and fpl risk exposure  as well as reduce market liquidity  and further increase the cost of hedging activities 

table of contents capital support letters of credit  surety bonds and guarantees nee and fpl obtain letters of credit and surety bonds and issue guarantees to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties and financings 
letters of credit  surety bonds and guarantees support  among other things  the buying and selling of wholesale energy commodities  debt and related reserves  nuclear activities  capital expenditures for neer wind and solar development and other contractual agreements 
substantially all of nee and fpl guarantee arrangements are on behalf of their consolidated subsidiaries for their related payment obligations 
in addition  as part of contract negotiations in the normal course of business  nee and fpl may agree to make payments to compensate or indemnify other parties for possible future unfavorable financial consequences resulting from specified events 
the specified events may include  but are not limited to  an adverse judgment in a lawsuit  the imposition of additional taxes due to a change in tax law or interpretations of the tax law or the non receipt of renewable tax credits or proceeds from cash grants under the recovery act 
nee and fpl are unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under some of these contracts because events that would obligate them have not yet occurred or  if any such event has occurred  they have not been notified of its occurrence 
in addition  nee has guaranteed certain payment obligations of neech  including most of its debt and all of its debentures and commercial paper issuances  as well as most of its payment guarantees and indemnifications  and neech has guaranteed certain debt and other obligations of neer and its subsidiaries 
at december   nee had approximately billion of standby letters of credit million for fpl  approximately million of surety bonds million for fpl and approximately billion notional amount of guarantees and indemnifications million for fpl  of which approximately billion of letters of credit  guarantees and indemnifications million for fpl have expiration dates within the next five years 
an aggregate of approximately billion of the standby letters of credit million for fpl at december  were issued under fpl s and neech s credit facilities 
each of nee and fpl believe it is unlikely that it would incur any liabilities associated with these letters of credit  surety bonds  guarantees and indemnifications 
accordingly  at december   nee and fpl did not have any liabilities recorded for these letters of credit  surety bonds  guarantees and indemnifications 
shelf registration in august  nee  neech and fpl filed a shelf registration statement with the sec for an unspecified amount of securities which became effective upon filing

b the outlook indicated by each of moody  s p and fitch is stable 

table of contents nee and its subsidiaries  including fpl  have no credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding debt 
a change in ratings is not an event of default under applicable debt instruments  and while there are conditions to drawing on the credit facilities noted above  with the exception of the spain senior secured limited recourse loan facility  the maintenance of a specific minimum credit rating is not a condition to drawing on these credit facilities 
commitment fees and interest rates on loans under these credit facilities agreements are tied to credit ratings 
a ratings downgrade also could reduce the accessibility and increase the cost of commercial paper and other short term debt issuances and additional or replacement credit facilities 
in addition  a ratings downgrade could result in the requirement that nee subsidiaries  including fpl  post collateral under certain agreements  including those related to fuel procurement  power sales and purchases  nuclear decommissioning funding  debt related reserves and trading activities 
fpl s and neech s credit facilities are available to support these potential requirements 
covenants nee charter does not limit the dividends that may be paid on its common stock 
as a practical matter  the ability of nee to pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon  among other things  dividends paid to it by its subsidiaries 
for example  fpl pays dividends to nee in a manner consistent with fpl long term targeted capital structure 
however  the mortgage securing fpl first mortgage bonds contains provisions which  under certain conditions  restrict the payment of dividends to nee and the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds 
additionally  in some circumstances  the mortgage restricts the amount of retained earnings that fpl can use to pay cash dividends on its common stock 
the restricted amount may change based on factors set out in the mortgage 
other than this restriction on the payment of common stock dividends  the mortgage does not restrict fpl use of retained earnings 
as of december   no retained earnings were restricted by these provisions of the mortgage and  in light of fpl current financial condition and level of earnings  management does not expect that planned financing activities or dividends would be affected by these limitations 
fpl may issue first mortgage bonds under its mortgage subject to its meeting an adjusted net earnings test set forth in the mortgage  which generally requires adjusted net earnings to be at least twice the annual interest requirements on  or at least of the aggregate principal amount of  fpl s first mortgage bonds including those to be issued and any other non junior fpl indebtedness 
as of december   coverage for the months ended december  would have been approximately times the annual interest requirements and approximately times the aggregate principal requirements 
new first mortgage bonds are also limited to an amount equal to the sum of of unfunded property additions after adjustments to offset property retirements  the amount of retired first mortgage bonds or qualified lien bonds and the amount of cash on deposit with the mortgage trustee 
as of december   fpl could have issued in excess of billion of additional first mortgage bonds based on the unfunded property additions and in excess of billion based on retired first mortgage bonds 
as of december   no cash was deposited with the mortgage trustee for these purposes

critical accounting policies and estimates nee s and fpl s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with gaap 
critical accounting policies are those that nee and fpl believe are both most important to the portrayal of their financial condition and results of operations  and require complex  subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
nee and fpl consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing their consolidated financial statements accounting for derivatives and hedging activities nee and fpl use derivative instruments primarily swaps  options  futures and forwards to manage the commodity price risk inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity  as well as interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with outstanding and forecasted debt issuances 
in addition  nee  through neer  uses derivatives to optimize the value of power generation assets and engages in power and gas marketing and trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements 
nature of accounting estimates accounting pronouncements require the use of fair value accounting if certain conditions are met  which requires significant judgment to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities 
this applies not only to traditional financial derivative instruments  but to any contract having the accounting characteristics of a derivative 
much of the existing accounting guidance related to derivatives focuses on when certain contracts for the purchase and sale of power and certain fuel supply contracts can be excluded from derivative accounting rules  however the guidance does not address all contract issues 
as a result  significant judgment must be used in applying derivatives accounting guidance to contracts 
in the event changes in interpretation occur  it is possible that contracts that currently are excluded from derivatives accounting rules would have to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value  with changes in the fair value recorded in the statement of income 

table of contents assumptions and accounting approach nee and fpl s derivative instruments  when required to be marked to market  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
fair values for some of the longer term contracts where liquid markets are not available are derived through internally developed models which estimate the fair value of a contract by calculating the present value of the difference between the contract price and the forward prices 
forward prices represent the price at which a buyer or seller could contract today to purchase or sell a commodity at a future date 
the near term forward market for electricity is generally liquid and therefore the prices in the early years of the forward curves reflect observable market quotes 
however  in the later years  the market is much less liquid and forward price curves must be developed using factors including the forward prices for the commodities used as fuel to generate electricity  the expected system heat rate which measures the efficiency of power plants in converting fuel to electricity in the region where the purchase or sale takes place  and a fundamental forecast of expected spot prices based on modeled supply and demand in the region 
nee estimates the fair value of interest rate and foreign currency derivatives using a discounted cash flows valuation technique based on the net amount of estimated future cash inflows and outflows related to the derivative agreements 
the assumptions in these models are critical since any changes therein could have a significant impact on the fair value of the derivative 
at fpl  substantially all changes in the fair value of energy derivative transactions are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled  and  upon settlement  any gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause or the capacity clause 
see note in nee s non rate regulated operations  predominantly neer  all changes in the derivatives fair value for power purchases and sales and trading activities are recognized on a net basis in operating revenues  fuel purchases and sales are recognized on a net basis in fuel  purchased power and interchange expense  and the equity method investees related activity is recognized in equity in earnings of equity method investees in nee s consolidated statements of income 
for those transactions accounted for as cash flow hedges  much of the effects of changes in fair value are reflected in oci  a component of common shareholders equity  rather than being recognized in current earnings 
for those transactions accounted for as fair value hedges  the effects of changes in fair value are reflected in current earnings offset by changes in the fair value of the item being hedged 
certain hedging transactions at neer are entered into as economic hedges but the transactions do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting or hedge accounting treatment is not elected 
changes in the fair value of those transactions are marked to market and reported in the consolidated statements of income  resulting in earnings volatility 
these changes in fair value are captured in the non qualifying hedge category in computing adjusted earnings 
this could be significant to neer s results because the economic offset to the positions  such as the physical assets from which power is generated  are not marked to market 
as a consequence  nee net income reflects only the movement in one part of economically linked transactions 
for this reason  nee s management views results expressed excluding the unrealized mark to market impact of the non qualifying hedges as a meaningful measure of current period performance

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits nee sponsors a qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all employees of nee and its subsidiaries 
nee also has a supplemental executive retirement plan serp which includes a non qualified supplemental defined benefit pension component that provides benefits to a select group of management and highly compensated employees 
the impact of the serp component is included within the pension plan as discussed below 
management believes that  based on actuarial assumptions and the well funded status of the pension plan  nee will not be required to make any cash contributions to the qualified pension plan in the near future 
in addition to pension benefits  nee sponsors a contributory postretirement plan for health care and life insurance benefits other benefits plan for retirees of nee and its subsidiaries meeting certain eligibility requirements 
the qualified pension plan has a fully funded trust dedicated to providing the benefits under the plan 
the other benefits plan has a partially funded trust dedicated to providing benefits related to life insurance 
nee allocates net periodic benefit income or cost associated with the pension and other benefits plans to its subsidiaries annually using specific criteria 

table of contents nature of accounting estimates for the pension plan  the benefit obligation is the actuarial present value as of the december measurement date  of all benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered to that date 
the amount of benefit to be paid depends on a number of future events incorporated into the pension benefit formula  including estimates of the average life of employees survivors and average years of service rendered 
the projected benefit obligation is measured based on assumptions concerning future interest rates and future employee compensation levels 
for the other benefits plan  the benefit obligation is the actuarial present value as of the december measurement date of all future benefits attributed under the terms of the other benefits plan to employee service rendered to that date 
nee derives pension income and the cost of the other benefits plan from actuarial calculations based on each plan s provisions and management s assumptions regarding discount rate  rate of increase in compensation levels and expected long term rate of return on plan assets and  in the case of the other benefits plan  health care cost trend rates 
assumptions and accounting approach accounting guidance requires recognition of the funded status of benefit plans in the balance sheet  with changes in the funded status recognized in other comprehensive income within shareholders equity in the year in which the changes occur 
since nee is the plan sponsor  and its subsidiaries do not have separate rights to the plan assets or direct obligations to their employees  this accounting guidance is reflected at nee and not allocated to the subsidiaries 
the portion of previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses  prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that are estimated to be allocable to fpl as net periodic benefit income cost in future periods and that otherwise would be recorded in aoci are classified as regulatory assets and liabilities at nee in accordance with regulatory treatment 
pension income and the cost of the other benefits plan are included in o m expenses  and are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions 
those assumptions for the years ended december   and include an expected long term rate of return on qualified plan assets of for the pension plan and for the other benefits plan  assumed increases in salary of  weighted average discount rates of  and for the pension plan and  and for the other benefits plan  respectively  and health care cost trend rates as related to other benefits for those under age of for medical and for prescription drug benefits and for those age and over of for medical and for prescription drug benefits 
these rates are assumed to decrease over the next years for medical benefits and years for prescription drug benefits to the ultimate trend rate of and remain at that level thereafter 
the ultimate trend rate is assumed to be reached in for medical benefits and for prescription drug benefits 
in developing these assumptions  nee evaluated input from its actuaries and consultants  as well as information available in the marketplace 
for the expected long term rate of return on fund assets  nee considered different models  capital market return assumptions and historical returns for a portfolio with an equity bond asset mix similar to its funds  as well as its funds historical compounded returns 
nee also considered input  including other qualitative and quantitative factors  from its actuaries and consultants as well as information available in the marketplace 
nee believes that and are reasonable long term rates of return on its pension plan and other benefits plan assets  respectively 
nee will continue to evaluate all of its actuarial assumptions  including its expected rate of return  at least annually  and will adjust them as necessary 
nee bases its determination of pension and other benefits plan expense or income on a market related valuation of assets  as prescribed by accounting guidance 
this market related valuation reduces year to year volatility and recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period following the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return realized on those assets 
since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period  the future value of assets will be affected as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized 
such gains and losses together with other differences between actual results and the estimates used in the actuarial valuations are deferred and recognized in determining pension income and other benefits plan expense only to the extent they exceed of the greater of projected benefit obligations or the market related value of assets 

table of contents the following table illustrates the effect on net periodic benefit income of changing the critical actuarial assumptions discussed above  while holding all other assumptions constant increase decrease in net periodic benefit income change in assumption nee fpl millions expected long term rate of return discount rate salary increase health care cost trend rate a a assumed health care cost trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for postretirement plans providing health care benefits 
however  this effect is somewhat mitigated by the retiree cost sharing structure incorporated in nee s other benefits plan 
see note carrying value of long lived assets nee evaluates long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
nature of accounting estimates the amount of future net cash flows  the timing of the cash flows and the determination of an appropriate interest rate all involve estimates and judgments about future events 
in particular  the aggregate amount of cash flows determines whether an impairment exists  and the timing of the cash flows is critical in determining fair value 
because each assessment is based on the facts and circumstances associated with each long lived asset  the effects of changes in assumptions cannot be generalized 
assumptions and accounting approach an impairment loss is required to be recognized if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows associated with that asset 
the impairment loss to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds the asset s fair value 
in most instances  the fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate interest rate

b represents total amount accrued for ratemaking purposes 

table of contents nature of accounting estimates the calculation of the future cost of retiring long lived assets  including nuclear decommissioning and plant dismantlement costs  involves estimating the amount and timing of future expenditures and making judgments concerning whether or not such costs are considered a legal obligation 
estimating the amount and timing of future expenditures includes  among other things  making projections of when assets will be retired and ultimately decommissioned and how costs will escalate with inflation 
in addition  nee and fpl also make interest rate and rate of return projections on their investments in determining recommended funding requirements for nuclear decommissioning costs 
periodically  nee and fpl are required to update these estimates and projections which can affect the annual expense amounts recognized  the liabilities recorded and the annual funding requirements for nuclear decommissioning costs 
for example  an increase of in the assumed escalation rates would increase nee s and fpl s asset retirement obligations and conditional asset retirement obligations collectively  aros as of december  by million and million  respectively 
assumptions and accounting approach nee and fpl each account for aros under accounting guidance that requires a liability for the fair value of an aro to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if it can be reasonably estimated  with the offsetting associated asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived assets 
fpl for ratemaking purposes  fpl accrues and funds for nuclear plant decommissioning costs over the expected service life of each unit based on studies that are filed with the fpsc 
the studies reflect  among other things  the expiration dates of the operating licenses for fpl s nuclear units 
the most recent studies  filed in  indicate that fpl s portion of the future cost of decommissioning its four nuclear units  including spent fuel storage above what is expected to be refunded by the doe under the spent fuel settlement agreement  is approximately billion  or billion expressed in dollars 
fpl accrues the cost of dismantling its fossil and solar plants over the expected service life of each unit based on studies filed with the fpsc 
unlike nuclear decommissioning  dismantlement costs are not funded 
the most recent studies became effective january  at december   fpl s portion of the ultimate cost to dismantle its fossil and solar units is approximately million  or million expressed in dollars 
the majority of the dismantlement costs are not considered aros 
fpl accrues for interim removal costs over the life of the related assets based on depreciation studies approved by the fpsc 
any differences between the aro amount recorded and the amount recorded for ratemaking purposes are reported as a regulatory liability in accordance with regulatory accounting 
neer neer records a liability for the present value of its expected decommissioning costs which is determined using various internal and external data and applying a probability percentage to a variety of scenarios regarding the life of the plant and timing of decommissioning 
the liability is being accreted using the interest method through the date decommissioning activities are expected to be complete 
at december   the aro for nuclear decommissioning of neer s nuclear plants totaled approximately million 
neer s portion of the ultimate cost of decommissioning its nuclear plants  including costs associated with spent fuel storage above what is expected to be refunded by the doe under the spent fuel settlement agreement  is estimated to be approximately billion  or billion expressed in dollars

all regulatory assets and liabilities are included in rate base or otherwise earn pay a return on investment during the recovery period 
assumptions and accounting approach accounting guidance allows regulators to create assets and impose liabilities that would not be recorded by non rate regulated entities 
if fpl were no longer subject to cost based rate regulation  the existing regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless regulators specify an alternative means of recovery or refund 
in addition  the fpsc has the authority to disallow recovery of costs that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred 
such costs may include  among others  fuel and o m expenses  the cost of replacing power lost when fossil and nuclear units are unavailable  storm restoration costs and costs associated with the construction or acquisition of new facilities 
the continued applicability of regulatory accounting is assessed at each reporting period 
energy marketing and trading and market risk sensitivity nee and fpl are exposed to risks associated with adverse changes in commodity prices  interest rates  equity prices and currency exchange rates 
financial instruments and positions affecting the financial statements of nee and fpl described below are held primarily for purposes other than trading 
market risk is measured as the potential loss in fair value resulting from hypothetical reasonably possible changes in commodity prices  interest rates  equity prices or currency exchange rates over the next year 
management has established risk management policies to monitor and manage such market risks  as well as credit risks 
commodity price risk nee and fpl use derivative instruments primarily swaps  options  futures and forwards to manage the commodity price risk inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity 
in addition  nee  through neer  uses derivatives to optimize the value of power generation assets and engages in power and gas marketing and trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements

nee uses a value at risk var model to measure commodity price market risk in its trading and mark to market portfolios 
the var is the estimated nominal loss of market value based on a one day holding period at a confidence level using historical simulation methodology

the var figures for the non qualifying hedges and hedges in oci and fpl cost recovery clauses category do not represent the economic exposure to commodity price movements 
interest rate risk nee and fpl are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of their respective issuances of debt  investments in special use funds and other investments 
nee and fpl manage their respective interest rate exposure by monitoring current interest rates  entering into interest rate swaps and using a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt 
interest rate swaps are used to mitigate and adjust interest rate exposure when deemed appropriate based upon market conditions or when required by financing agreements 

table of contents the following are estimates of the fair value of nee and fpl financial instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk december  december  carrying amount estimated fair value carrying amount estimated fair value millions nee fixed income securities special use funds a a other investments debt securities a a notes receivable b b long term debt  including current maturities c d d interest rate swaps net unrealized losses e e fpl fixed income securities special use funds a a long term debt  including current maturities d d a estimated using quoted market prices for these or similar issues 
b estimated using a discounted cash flow valuation technique based on certain observable yield curves and indices considering the credit profile of the borrower 
c also includes long term debt reflected in liabilities associated with assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets  for which carrying amount approximates fair value 
d estimated using either quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or discounted cash flow valuation technique  considering the current credit spread of the debtor 
e modeled internally using discounted cash flow valuation technique and applying a credit valuation adjustment 
the special use funds of nee and fpl consist of restricted funds set aside to cover the cost of storm damage for fpl and for the decommissioning of nee and fpl nuclear power plants 
a portion of these funds is invested in fixed income debt securities primarily carried at estimated fair value 
at fpl  changes in fair value  including any otti losses  result in a corresponding adjustment to the related liability accounts based on current regulatory treatment 
the changes in fair value of nee non rate regulated operations result in a corresponding adjustment to oci  except for impairments deemed to be other than temporary  including any credit losses  which are reported in current period earnings 
because the funds set aside by fpl for storm damage could be needed at any time  the related investments are generally more liquid and  therefore  are less sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the nuclear decommissioning funds  in contrast  are generally invested in longer term securities  as decommissioning activities are not scheduled to begin until at least at fpl 
as of december   nee had interest rate swaps with a notional amount of approximately billion related to long term debt issuances  of which billion are fair value hedges at neech that effectively convert fixed rate debt to a variable rate instrument 
the remaining billion of notional amount of interest rate swaps relate to cash flow hedges to manage exposure to the variability of cash flows associated with variable rate debt instruments  the majority of which relate to neer debt issuances 
at december   the estimated fair value of nee fair value hedges and cash flow hedges was approximately million and million  respectively 
see note based upon a hypothetical decrease in interest rates  which is a reasonable near term market change  the net fair value of nee s net liabilities would increase by approximately  million million for fpl at december  equity price risk nee and fpl are exposed to risk resulting from changes in prices for equity securities 
for example  nee s nuclear decommissioning reserve funds include marketable equity securities primarily carried at their market value of approximately  million and  million  million and  million for fpl at december  and  respectively 
at december   a hypothetical decrease in the prices quoted by stock exchanges  which is a reasonable near term market change  would result in a million million for fpl reduction in fair value 
for fpl  a corresponding adjustment would be made to the related liability accounts based on current regulatory treatment  and for nee s non rate regulated operations  a corresponding adjustment would be made to oci to the extent the market value of the securities exceeded amortized cost and to otti loss to the extent the market value is below amortized cost 
currency exchange rate risk at december   with respect to certain debt issuances and borrowings  neech has two cross currency swaps to hedge against currency movements with respect to both interest and principal payments and a cross currency swap to hedge against currency and interest rate movements with respect to both interest and principal payments 
at december  and  the fair value of cross currency swaps was approximately million and million  respectively 

table of contents credit risk nee and its subsidiaries are also exposed to credit risk through their energy marketing and trading operations 
credit risk is the risk that a financial loss will be incurred if a counterparty to a transaction does not fulfill its financial obligation 
nee manages counterparty credit risk for its subsidiaries with energy marketing and trading operations through established policies  including counterparty credit limits  and in some cases credit enhancements  such as cash prepayments  letters of credit  cash and other collateral and guarantees 
credit risk is also managed through the use of master netting agreements 
nee s credit department monitors current and forward credit exposure to counterparties and their affiliates  both on an individual and an aggregate basis 
for all derivative and contractual transactions  nee s energy marketing and trading operations  which includes fpl s energy marketing and trading division  are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to these transactions 
some relevant considerations when assessing nee s energy marketing and trading operations credit risk exposure include the following operations are primarily concentrated in the energy industry 
trade receivables and other financial instruments are predominately with energy  utility and financial services related companies  as well as municipalities  cooperatives and other trading companies in the us overall credit risk is managed through established credit policies and is overseen by the emc 
prospective and existing customers are reviewed for creditworthiness based upon established standards  with customers not meeting minimum standards providing various credit enhancements or secured payment terms  such as letters of credit or the posting of margin cash collateral 
master netting agreements are used to offset cash and non cash gains and losses arising from derivative instruments with the same counterparty 
nee s policy is to have master netting agreements in place with significant counterparties 
based on nee s policies and risk exposures related to credit  nee and fpl do not anticipate a material adverse effect on their financial statements as a result of counterparty nonperformance 
as of december   approximately of nee s and of fpl s energy marketing and trading counterparty credit risk exposure is associated with companies that have investment grade credit ratings
