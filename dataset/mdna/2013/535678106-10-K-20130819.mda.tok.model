critical accounting policies the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require it to make estimates and judgments that significantly affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company regularly evaluates these estimates  including those related to inventory valuation  revenue recognition and income taxes 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed by management to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates  which may impact the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues when the earnings process is complete  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
during fiscal years and  the company recognized approximately and  respectively  of net revenues from domestic distributors that are recognized under agreements which provide for certain sales price rebates and limited product return privileges 
given the uncertainties associated with the levels of pricing rebates  the ultimate sales price on domestic distributor sales transactions is not fixed or determinable until domestic distributors sell the merchandise to the end user 
at the time of shipment to domestic distributors  the company records a trade receivable and deferred revenue at the distributor purchasing price since there is a legally enforceable obligation from the distributor to pay for the products delivered 
the company relieves inventory as title has passed to the distributor and recognizes deferred cost of sales in the same amount 
deferred income on shipments to distributors represents the difference between deferred revenue and deferred cost of sales and is recognized as a current liability until such time as the distributor confirms a final sale to its end customer 
at june   the company had approximately million of deferred revenue and million of deferred cost of sales recognized as million of deferred income on shipments to distributors 
at july   the company had approximately million of deferred revenue and million of deferred cost of sales recognized as million of deferred income on shipments to distributors 
the company believes that its deferred costs of revenues have limited risk of material impairment  as the company offers stock rotation privileges to distributors up to to of quarterly purchases which enable distributors to rotate slow moving inventory 
in addition  stock rotated inventory that is returned to the company is generally resalable 
the company reviews distributor ending on hand inventory balances  as well as orders placed on the company to ensure that distributors are not overstocking parts and are ordering to forecasted demand 
to the extent the company were to have a significant reduction in distributor price or grant significant price rebates  there could be a material impact on the ultimate revenue and gross profit recognized 
the price rebates that have been remitted back to distributors have ranged from million to million per quarter 
the company s sales to international distributors are made under agreements which permit limited stock return privileges but not sales price rebates 
revenue on these sales is recognized upon shipment at which time title passes 
the company has reserves to cover expected product returns 
if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed or are below expectations  the company may determine that additional or less sales return allowances are required to properly reflect its estimated exposure for product returns 
generally  changes to sales return allowances have not had a significant impact on operating margin 
inventory valuation the company values inventories at the lower of cost or market 
the company records charges to write down inventories for unsalable  excess or obsolete raw materials  work in process and finished goods 
newly introduced parts are generally not valued until success in the market place has been determined by a consistent pattern of sales and backlog among other factors 
the company arrives at the estimate for newly released parts by analyzing sales and customer backlog against ending inventory on hand 
the company reviews the assumptions on a quarterly basis and makes decisions with regard to inventory valuation based on the current business climate 
in addition to write downs based on newly introduced parts  judgmental assessments are calculated for the remaining inventory based on salability  obsolescence  historical experience and current business conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required that could adversely affect operating results 
if actual market conditions are more favorable  the company may have higher gross margins when products are sold 
sales to date of such products have not had a significant impact on gross margin 
income taxes the company must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  tax benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to the tax provision in a subsequent period 
the calculation of the company s tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
the company recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed in the authoritative accounting literature 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires the company to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as the company has to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
the company reevaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision
