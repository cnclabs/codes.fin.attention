item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements for the years ended december   and  and related notes included elsewhere in this document 
overview we provide secure information exchange capabilities for consumers and enterprises through the development and distribution of software  delivery of managed and hosted solutions and provisioning of associated services 
we have thousands of enterprise customers and more than one million individual consumers in over countries 
our solutions are used by more than  us army users deployed worldwide 
we operate primarily in the managed file transfer  or mft  industry 
we are evolving our mft focus into adjacent solution spaces  including creating what we refer to as total path security 
the total path security framework addresses data and information management  movement  security and accessibility across a broad range of environments encompassing data and information in motion for example  with traditional mft solutions delivered as on premises software or as a cloud service and at rest for example  through securely deleting or purging files or securely accessing stored data from mobile tablet or smartphone devices using our tappin solution 
our solution portfolio facilitates transmission of critical information such as financial data  medical records  customer files  vendor files  personnel files and other similar documents between diverse and geographically separated network infrastructures while supporting a range of information protection approaches to meet privacy and other security requirements 
our products provide the ability to monitor these activities  as well as access the underlying data  securely and flexibly through a wide range of network enabled  mobile devices  including tablets and smartphones 
our solutions enable compliance with government regulations relating to the protection of information while allowing users to reduce it costs  increase efficiency  track and audit transactions and automate processes 
our solutions also provide data replication  acceleration of file transfer  sharing collaboration and continuous data backup and recovery to our customers 
we believe we are strongly positioned to provide secure transfer  sharing  and replication of files that need to be transmitted inside the user s firewall to distributed offices  or outside the user s firewall to business and trading partners  including network enabled  mobile devices 
our initial product  cuteftp  a file transfer protocol client program used mostly by individuals and small businesses  was first distributed in over the internet and achieved significant success and popularity 
since then  we have continued to enhance our portfolio of products to meet the increasing demand for secure information exchange in the mft industry and adjacent markets such as cloud services 
our capabilities have evolved from personal and small business mft products to include standard and enterprise versions of our enhanced file transfer  or eft software  with an increasing number of add on modules that provide additional capabilities such as ad hoc file transfer  advanced auditing and reporting  government validated cryptography  and workflow automation 
we have also developed wide area file services  or wafs  and continuous data protection  or cdp  software which further enhances the ability to replicate  share and backup files within a wide area network or local area network  at wan and lan speeds 

table of contents we also offer managed e mail attachment  software as a service  or saas  and cloud based subscription products and solutions for information sharing solutions 
our managed e mail attachment solution addresses the needs of customers who are constrained by the typical limits on e mail attachment size or who require additional security  auditing  and reporting for file attachments shared through e mail 
our saas and cloud based subscription solutions allow customers to reduce their upfront and total cost of ownership and achieve other recognized benefits of cloud based solutions  including service elasticity and strong service level agreements for it infrastructure reliability and performance 
our managed cloud based subscription solutions are a notable part of our future revenue model plans because they provide recurring revenue which potentially builds over time  as compared to sales of on premises software licenses which must be reconstituted every period 
while we are in the early stages of growing our subscription services  we already have added capability to deliver these services in additional geographies  such as the united kingdom and canada  where country specific compliance requirements may necessitate in country service delivery in december  we entered the secure content mobility market with the acquisition of tappin  inc secure content mobility provides users with the ability to easily and securely access and share data and information using a web browser  tablet or other mobile device such as a smartphone 
secure content mobility integrates aspects of ad hoc file transfer  broader mft capabilities  cloud services  and remote accessibility to address growing market demand for secure  anytime and anywhere  device independent access to distributed content 
we believe that the addition of secure content mobility capability to our portfolio potentially has profound implications due to the continuing growth of tablet computers and smartphone sales and their increasing adoption by business users 
key business metrics key business metrics we review a number of key business metrics on an ongoing basis to help us monitor our performance and to identify material trends which may affect our business 
the measures that we believe are the primary indicators of our performance are revenue growth recurring revenue growth aggregate contract value growth adjusted ebitda excluding infrequent items revenue growth since  we have transitioned from a consumer products company mostly focused on the cuteftp product line to an mft enterprise solutions provider with a focus on increasing the revenue contribution from cloud based solutions  enabling secure mobile access to data and delivering professional services while continuing to grow our core mft business 
we have grown revenue consistently throughout this transition such that our enterprise solutions sales have grown from less than of our revenue as recently as to now comprising more than of our sales with our cuteftp consumer products accounting for less than of revenue for the year ended december  we believe our ability to sustain revenue growth while continuing this business evolution is the most significant metric for our business 
although we often have grown revenue sequentially quarter over quarter in recent years  we view annual revenue growth as the more important metric  especially considering the ongoing evolution of our solution 
table of contents portfolio 
we believe annual core revenue growth  excluding larger  exceptional transactions  is a key metric for monitoring our continued success in developing our business in future periods 
given our diverse solution portfolio and the addition of subscription services  we review our revenue mix and changes in revenue  across all solutions  on a regular basis to identify key trends and adjust resource allocations 
we believe attaining additional traction in the cloud based managed solutions and secure content mobility market segments  realizing the potential of new software solutions  and our ability to continue developing and enhancing our existing software solutions are significant factors in our continued ability to sustain or possibly increase our revenue growth in future years 
the impact of cloud based managed solutions on our revenue growth trends depends on several key factors  including the number of customers who may shift from software licenses to subscription services  the rate at which they may do so  the subscription term and fees  and the comparative value of the opportunity had it materialized as a software license sale instead of as a subscription service 
generally  for a fixed number of opportunities that is  without considering the possibility that a new service offering may result in additional sales opportunities  addition of subscription services reduces revenue growth rates for several quarters for the associated software license solutions until cumulative subscription revenue increases and  potentially  surpasses comparable software license revenue 
the revenue impacts are particularly pronounced early in the introduction of subscription services because there has been only a short time period for accumulation of the recurring revenue stream 
similarly  we believe market adoption of secure content mobility solutions  such as those provided by tappin  will increase in future periods as use of personal computing devices  such as smart phones and tablets  continues to grow exponentially and as businesses increasingly embrace byod operating models 
see the section below comparing our results of operations for the years ended december   and  for discussion of the revenue trends we have experienced 
recurring revenue growth 
recurring revenue includes revenue recognized from our maintenance and support  or m s contracts  managed and hosted solutions  and other subscription services such as from our tappin product line 
m s contracts for our products are sold for fixed periods of time and are typically for one year with some agreements having longer terms 
we recognize revenue from these contracts on a monthly basis over the life of the contract 
managed and hosted solutions  such as mix and hosted eft  are sold as one  two  or three year subscriptions with the services invoiced and revenue recognized on a monthly basis 
tappin subscriptions typically are sold for one year terms with the revenue recognized on a monthly basis 
recurring revenue provides a more predictable revenue stream in future periods which we believe is highly valued by institutional investors and other market participants 
we review recurring revenue trends periodically to determine the progress of our m s and cloud solution sales and customer satisfaction with our ongoing solution development and support activities 
we also assess how aggregate contract value see further discussion below will factor into possible recurring revenue in future periods 
see the section below comparing our results of operations for the years ended december   and  for discussion of the recurring revenue trends we have experienced 

table of contents aggregate contract value growth 
aggregate contract value  or acv  is a measure of future revenue potential we have in place under non cancellable contracts for product sales  maintenance and support  managed solutions  and professional services for which we will recognize revenue in future periods 
acv is the sum of deferred revenue resulting from payments we have already received for services to be provided in the future 
amounts we are due to be paid under non cancellable contracts for future services we will provide under those contracts 
our acv growth as illustrated in the table below is a result of sales success in numerous areas of our business 
while we expect acv may grow in future periods as we potentially continue to increase our volume of non cancellable contracts for future delivery of our products and services  it could also decrease for a number of reasons including existing customers electing not to renew their maintenance and support contracts or a large professional services contract  such as those we have in place to provide services to the us army  not being renewed for additional terms as provided in certain of those contracts 
acv is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap and should not be considered a substitute for deferred revenue 
we use this metric to assess the effectiveness of sales and business development activities and how that effectiveness will factor into future revenue 
we have maintained increased visibility into acv in recent years because with the addition of subscription services and increased sales of professional services  we believe sales growth may significantly outpace revenue growth in the near term 
acv  together with recurring revenue and deferred revenue trends  provides greater insight into how bookings will factor into revenue over specific periods 
we determine acv related to non cancellable contracts for future delivery of our products and services as follows december  thousands amounts we have billed and or been paid in advance presented as deferred revenue in our financial statements amounts we will bill and be paid in the future will appear in our financial statements when we are paid and or when we provide the products and services total acv non gaap financial measures in addition to our financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap  we use certain supplemental  non gaap measures as defined by the securities and exchange commission to monitor the financial performance of our core operating activities prior to consideration of significant events that occur infrequently 
those non gaap measures include non gaap operating expenses non gaap operating income non gaap net income non gaap earnings per share each of these non gaap financial measures excludes the effects of the affiliated entity asset impairment and the tappin earnout liability not paid that are part of our consolidated statements of operations and 
table of contents comprehensive income prepared in accordance with gaap 
we exclude these items when determining our non gaap financial measures because we do not consider them part of our core operating results when assessing our operational performance  allocating resources to our business activities and preparing operating budgets 
we believe that by comparing our non gaap financial measures across historical periods  our operating results can be evaluated exclusive of the effects of certain items that may not be indicative of our core operations 
while we believe these non gaap financial measures provide useful supplemental information  there are limitations associated with the use of these non gaap financial measures 
these non gaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies since there is no standard for preparing these non gaap financial measures 
each of the excluded items listed above individually and collectively can have a material impact on operating expenses  operating income  net income and earnings per share 
as a result  these non gaap financial measures have limitations and should not be considered in isolation from  or as a substitute for  financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 
year ended december  in s except per share amounts non gaap operating expenses gaap total operating expenses affiliated entity asset impairment tappin earnout liability not earned non gaap operating expenses non gaap loss income from operations gaap loss income from operations affiliated entity asset impairment tappin earnout liability not earned non gaap income from operations non gaap net income loss gaap net loss income affiliated entity asset impairment tappin earnout liability not earned non gaap net income non gaap earnings per share non gaap net income weighted average share outstanding basic diluted non gaap net income per common share basic diluted the affiliated entity asset impairment effect on non gaap net income of million is the gross affiliated entity asset impairment associated with the write off of our investment in  and our notes receivable from  coretrace corporation 
there is no related federal income tax effect reflected here because this item is a capital loss for federal income tax purposes for which we are uncertain as to whether we will generate sufficient capital gains in the future against which this capital loss can be applied 
the tappin earnout liability not paid of million is the gross amount of the liability relieved 
there is no related federal income tax effect because the elimination of the liability for this payment is not a taxable event for federal income tax purposes 

table of contents see our comparison of results for the years ended december   and  below for our discussion of variations in the underlying elements comprising the amounts above 
adjusted ebitda excluding infrequent items management utilizes adjusted ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  total other income expense  depreciation  amortization and share based compensation expense excluding infrequent items to measure profitability and cash flow from the company s core operating activities 
we monitor and review cost of revenues  selling  general  and administrative  or sg a  expenses and research and development  or r d  expenses to assess conformance with established budget expectations and to identify specific variances 
identifying and  if necessary  addressing variances above budget is important for the purpose of staying within budget ceilings 
however  even variances below budget may indicate imbalances in resource allocations or deviation of operating activities from established expectations 
we exclude infrequent items because when they occur  they typically do not directly impact profitability and cash flow resulting from the company s core activities 
for the year ended december   the reduction to zero of the carrying value of our investment in  and notes receivable  from coretrace corporation and the tappin earnout liability not paid were infrequent items 
adjusted ebitda excluding infrequent items is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered a substitute for net income 
adjusted ebitda excluding infrequent items has limitations as an analytical tool and when assessing our operating performance 
adjusted ebitda excluding infrequent items should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other income statement data prepared in accordance with gaap 
we compute adjusted ebitda excluding infrequent items as follows in thousands year ended december  net loss income add subtract items to determine adjusted ebitda income tax expense other expense depreciation and amortization stock based compensation expense affliated entity asset impairment tappin earnout liability not paid adjusted ebitda see the section below comparing our results of operations for the years ended december   and  for discussion of the variances between periods in the components comprising adjusted ebitda 

table of contents solution perspective and trends the following is a summary description of our products and solutions 
our discussion of the business trends of our products is based on the following profile of our revenue components in thousands revenue for the year ended december  amount percent of total amount percent of total amount percent of total revenue by product eft server enterprise eft server wide area file services cdp professional services cuteftp other total operating revenues maintenance and support included in total operating revenue managed file transfer solutions on premises and cloud based our mft products and solutions allow customers to move large files and large numbers of files securely 
we facilitate management  monitoring  and reporting on the file transfers and deliver advanced workflow capabilities to move data and information into and throughout an enterprise 
we earn most of our software license revenue from sales of our eft standard edition and eft enterprise edition products and solutions 
these products and solutions provide a common  scalable mft platform that accommodates a broad family of add on modules to provide smb and enterprise customers with increased security  automation  and performance when compared to traditional ftp based and e mail delivery systems 
the add on modules allow customers to select the solution configuration most applicable to their requirements for auditing and reporting  encryption  ad hoc and web based file transfers  operability in or through a dmz network  and integration with back end business processes  including workflow automation capabilities 
we continue to develop these products and solutions by  for example  improving their speed and responsiveness of performance  providing additional administration flexibility supporting cross platform implementation with our dmz gateway solution  implementing business activity monitoring  and providing additional language support 
we have sustained the year to year increase in our revenue from these products and solutions as a result of our ongoing development of this product line that has continued to enhance its appeal in the marketplace 
cuteftp is a client side software product  installed on a user s local computer  that enables file transfers from or to an ftp server 
the target market for the cuteftp product includes corporate it professionals who use it to transfer data between locations via the internet and individual web site operators who use it to upload their web pages to their web hosting provider  among others 
while cuteftp still has significant brand recognition in the market  the revenue dollars we earn from this product line and its percent of our total revenue has declined in recent years 
we believe market availability of free ftp utilities and the emergence of social media with imbedded capabilities for sharing non sensitive data such as photos and videos are examples of the primary causes of the decline in cuteftp revenue 
we released our current cuteftp version in november the version release includes a number of updates  including support for unicode utf characters that will allow greater international use and web distributed authoring and versioning webdav support to facilitate collaboration between users in editing and managing documents and files stored on world wide web servers 
in creating the version release  we also simplified our cuteftp product line by consolidated all the features of 
table of contents our previous multi product cuteftp product line for windows operating systems into the single new version 
we also continue to offer cuteftp version software for mac platforms 
we believe this product version product  as well as our continued offering of version for mac platforms  can appeal to users wanting features more robust than offered in free alternatives and potentially may slow the rate of decrease in cuteftp s level of contribution to our revenue in the future 
we have a partner agreement with rackspace hosting  inc  a world leader in the hosting and cloud computing industry that began in we have a similar agreement with peer hosting to meet the growing european demand for our services 
through these relationships  we deliver cloud based  managed file transfer solutions for the secure exchange of business to business data  including large files and sensitive data 
our cloud based solutions allow customers to outsource all or part of their complex and demanding information exchange needs to reduce costs  improve operational efficiencies  track and audit transactions  and provide a greater level of security 
we offer our cloud services capability in the united states  as well as in the united kingdom and canada  to support solution delivery in instances where country specific compliance requirements may necessitate in country delivery of the services 
the cloud based solutions established an additional delivery method for our mft products and solutions and potentially for other solution capabilities 
through our cloud services  we can offer new and existing customers pay as you go  flexible pricing under one  two  and three year contracts that help them eliminate upfront capital expenditures 
this subscription revenue provides us with a growing revenue stream visible into future periods 
the revenue we earn from this product line is included in other revenue in the table above 
while this revenue has grown from year to year  it does not yet constitute a material portion of our overall revenue 
wide area file services and continuous data protection solution our wide area file services  or wafs  software provides a file sharing  collaboration  and replication solution over multiple sites 
wafs technology can have our continuous data protection cdp product added to provide enterprises with a file access and data protection combination that centralizes data storage and it administration facilities but doesn t compromise data sharing and protection 
we experienced a decline in wafs revenue during as the marketplace anticipated a product upgrade forthcoming at that time 
we released wafs  a major upgrade of the solution  in september wafs introduced a new user interface  support for unicode characters to facilitate greater international sales  and other significant enhancements 
wafs allowed us to increase revenue from that product line in  reversing a multi year trend of declining revenue 
we believe wafs will be competitive in the marketplace for the foreseeable future as a product serving the need for wide area file access and data protection 
managed e mail attachment solution our managed e mail attachment solution  mail express  is a client server application that allows users to send and receive e mail attachments  up to gb  with enhanced security and visibility compared to typical e mail solutions 
the mail express application provides flexible  customer defined administration privileges to allow e mail administrators and end users to configure specific parameters for handling e mail attachments in accordance with corporate policy 
we released mail express in august which led to continued revenue growth from that product line in and in february  we announced the general availability of mail express version that includes a number of enhancements including integration with eft we believe mail express will be competitive in the marketplace for the foreseeable future as a product for securely sharing and managing large e mail attachments 

table of contents secure content mobility solution we acquired tappin  inc in december to provide us with initial entry into the secure content mobility market 
the tappin by globalscape service provides the ability to easily and securely access and share documents  pictures  videos and music anytime  anywhere while eliminating or minimizing the storage of data in the cloud and the associated security and privacy concerns 
from the office  at home  or on the road  customers can tapp in to their files  stored in multiple locations  using any web browser and most internet enabled mobile devices including apple iphone and ipad  google android and windows phone and kindle fire 
with tappin  users can avoid uploading and or syncing to a cloud storage location and eliminate the need to pay for additional cloud storage 
instead  the tappin service securely accesses the user s existing in house storage devices such as a desktop computer  in house network servers or network attached storage devices  allows sharing files of any size and provides encryption to safeguard content 
the tappin by globalscape service incorporates elements of on premises software  cloud and saas delivery models 
unlike other remote access products that can consume significant amounts of storage capacity on a smartphone or tablet  tappin makes content available through a secure pathway that gives users access to files on their existing in house storage devices without having to download those files to their mobile device 
this delivery method not only saves storage space on the mobile device but also ensures content remains secure and private on the user s existing in house storage devices 
we believe secure content mobility is a rapidly emerging central feature of our served markets  including our primary mft market 
exponential growth in smartphone and tablet sales and adoption  combined with rapid growth in retained content and byod expectations  will drive strong revenue growth in this market segment 
professional services we offer a range of professional services to complement our software and cloud based solutions 
these professional services include product customization and system integration  solution quickstart implementations  business process and workflow  policy development  education and training  and health checks 
in addition  we may provide longer term engineering services  including supporting multi year contracts  if necessary to support certain solution implementations and integrations 
professional services decreased slightly from million  or percent of revenue in  to million or percent of revenue in due to a decrease in revenue earned under our contract supporting the standard army maintenance system enhanced  or sams e  logistics program as a result of various budget action and project scope decisions made by the us army and the primary contractor to the us army  whom we support under this contract 
the scope of this contract may continue to change in the future due to a variety of factors  including availability of government budget authorization for the sams e program and our evolving work share of the contract 
we believe we can continue to increase deliveries of our commercial non government professional services as we increasingly bundle those services with new sales of our enterprise solutions and as we sell repeat services to our prior customers 
our increased professional services lead to a corresponding increase in our cost of revenues or cost of goods sold  because the services necessarily are labor intensive 
for this reason  professional services typically have significantly lower margins than product sales or subscription services 
however  we believe professional services allow us to better establish and maintain our solution implementations  while also providing our customers with the training and education services that help them make more complete use of our solution capabilities 
in addition  for large contracts like the engineering services we provide to the us army  such professional services provide significant past performance that facilitates additional business 
over time  we believe the return on investment from increased professional services outweighs the potential near term impacts on operating margins 

table of contents endpoint security solution we had planned to enter the endpoint security market through development of appshield  a software application control or whitelisting product 
the appshield product was being developed under a joint development and reseller agreement between globalscape and coretrace corporation 
in november  coretrace corporation sold substantially all of its assets to an unrelated third party resulting in coretrace ending its development work on appshield 
this action provided us possession of the appshield source code while sustaining our prior appshield related license rights 
the notable resulting change is that we now have the right to sell products based on the appshield source code with no royalty obligation to coretrace corporation or any other party 
the consumer application control market has matured significantly since appshield product development began in that situation necessitates additional development work on the appshield source code  which possibly could be significant  to bring appshield to market 
we are investigating whether to further develop this product on our own  engage others to continue the development for us  or sell the appshield rights to another party 
as a result  we have no date scheduled for introduction of appshield to the market nor do we have specific plans to pursue such introduction 
overall revenue trends and mix between products  services  and maintenance and support our revenue from software licenses and professional services ie all sources other than m s sales increased in compared to and in compared to notable factors yielding these combined results include software license revenue from our eft  wafs and other software products ie all software products other than cuteftp grew in compared to and declined in compared to the decline in was due to pricing pressure in the marketplace on eft enterprise due primarily to general economic conditions resulting in a related responsive promotion in during which we discounted the price of certain of our eft products 
we resumed growth in these license revenues in as improved market conditions relieved pricing pressure  and we were able to achieve eft enterprise sales targets without continuing the discounting promotion from the growth rate in is consistent with our expectations for these products that present our latest technologies to the marketplace  that constitute over of our software license revenue and that contribute significantly to our operating margins 
software license revenue from cuteftp declined in compared to and declined in compared to while this trend is unfavorable  it is not inconsistent with our expectations 
as discussed elsewhere in this document and in our previous regulatory filings  while cuteftp still has significant brand recognition in the market  the revenue dollars we earn from this product line and its percent of our total revenue has declined in recent years 
we believe market availability of free ftp utilities and the emergence of social media with imbedded capabilities for sharing non sensitive data such as photos and videos are examples of the primary causes of the decline in cuteftp revenue 
we believe cuteftp version  as well as our continued offering of version for mac platforms  can appeal to users wanting features more robust than offered in free alternatives and potentially may slow the rate of decrease in cuteftp s level of contribution to our revenue in the future 
professional services revenue declined in compared to after increasing over in compared to we earn a significant portion of this professional services revenue in and in under our contract supporting the standard army maintenance system enhanced  or sams e  logistics program 
this program  which is dependent upon federal funding as determined by the united states congress  is subject to unpredictable and varying budget actions and project scope decisions between the us army and the primary contractor to the us army whom we support under this contract  which are factors beyond our control 
the scope of this contract may continue to change in the future due to a variety of factors  including availability of government budget authorization for the sams e program and our evolving work share of the contract 

table of contents m s revenue increased in compared to and in compared to m s revenue as a percent of our total revenue was  and in  and  respectively 
this continued growth in m s revenue is consistent with the continued growth in our deferred revenue balance at each year end 
our m s revenue growth and its increasing percentage of our total revenue are primarily due to the growing installed base of our software products in the marketplace 
this installed base growth creates a compounding effect for m s renewals since the cumulative number of licensed software installations sold over multiple years that create m s renewals in any single year predictably and in line with our expectations exceeds the number of new software licenses we sell in a single year 
we expect this compounding effect to continue to grow 
we view this m s revenue increase as a positive indicator of our customers ongoing satisfaction with our products purchased in past years 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash of million 
we generated cash in excess of million from our operating activities in each of  and we rely on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to fund our operations and believe these items will be our principal sources of operating capital in at december   our net working capital position was  the current liabilities component of that working capital included million of deferred revenue which  unlike all other liability components of our working capital  is an obligation we will satisfy through ongoing operating activities from which we have historically generated cash flow and not through a disbursement of cash as a direct payment of that liability 
our capital requirements principally relate to our need to fund our ongoing operating expenditures  which are primarily related to employee salaries and benefits 
we make these expenditures to enhance our existing products  develop new products  sell those products in the marketplace and support our customers after the sale 
in  we enhanced our product offerings through the acquisition of tappin  a secure content mobility solution company 
at the time of that acquisition  we paid the tappin selling stockholders million which we funded with million of our cash on hand and million borrowed under our notes payable to a bank 
in  the tappin shareholders earned an additional milestone payment provided for under the purchase agreement of million of which we paid million in and  in from our cash on hand 
if certain tappin product revenue milestones are achieved by december   we will be obligated to pay the former stockholders of tappin an additional million because our principal sources of capital are cash on hand and cash flow from operations  to the extent that sales decline  our cash flow from operations could also decline 
if sales decline or if our liquidity is otherwise under duress  management could substantially reduce personnel and personnel related costs  reduce or substantially eliminate capital expenditures and or reduce or substantially eliminate certain research and development expenditures 
we may also sell equity or debt securities or enter into credit arrangements in order to finance future acquisitions or licensing activities  to the extent available 
cash provided or used by our various activities consisted of the following in thousands year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities 
table of contents the variations in these amounts between years are due to the following items 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated statement of cash flows presented below in
