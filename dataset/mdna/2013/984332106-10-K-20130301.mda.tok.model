table of contents for the year ended december   adjusted ebitda decreased million  or percent  compared to  due to a decline in revenue year over year offset by a decline in operating costs 
the decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to a decline in search revenue 
the decline in operating costs year over year was attributable to a decline in search tac resulting from the required change in revenue presentation for transitioned markets in the fourth quarter of due to the search agreement with microsoft described under significant transactions below as we no longer incur search tac for transitioned markets

for the year ended december   free cash flow increased million  or percent  compared to the increase was primarily attributable to a decline in capital expenditures and an increase in net cash provided by operating activities 
non gaap financial measures revenue ex tac 
revenue ex tac is a non gaap financial measure defined as gaap revenue less tac 
tac consists of payments made to affiliates that have integrated our advertising offerings into their sites and payments made to companies that direct consumer and business traffic to yahoo properties 
based on the terms of the search agreement with microsoft described under significant transactions below  microsoft retains a revenue share of percent of the net after tac search revenue generated on yahoo properties and affiliate sites in transitioned markets 
we report the net revenue we receive under the search agreement as revenue and no longer present the associated tac 
accordingly  for transitioned markets we report gaap revenue associated with the search agreement on a net after tac basis rather than a gross basis 
for markets that have not yet transitioned  revenue continues to be recorded on a gross basis  and tac is recorded as a part of operating expenses 
we present revenue ex tac to provide investors a metric used by us for evaluation and decision making purposes during the microsoft transition and to provide investors with comparable revenue numbers when comparing periods preceding  during and following the transition period 
a limitation of revenue ex tac is that it is a measure which we have defined for internal and investor purposes that may be unique to us  and therefore it may not enhance the comparability of our results to other companies in our industry who have similar business arrangements but address the impact of tac differently 
management compensates for these limitations by also relying on the comparable gaap financial measures of revenue and total operating expenses  which include tac in non transitioned markets 

table of contents adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure defined as net income attributable to yahoo inc before taxes  depreciation  amortization of intangible assets  stock based compensation expense  other income  net which includes interest  earnings in equity interests  net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and certain gains  losses  and expenses that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing results 
we present adjusted ebitda because the exclusion of certain gains  losses  and expenses facilitates comparisons of the operating performance of our company on a period to period basis 
adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results reported under gaap 
these limitations include adjusted ebitda does not reflect tax payments and such payments reflect a reduction in cash available to us  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our businesses  adjusted ebitda does not include stock based compensation expense related to our workforce  adjusted ebitda also excludes other income  net which includes interest  earnings in equity interests  net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and certain gains  losses  and expenses that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing results  and these items may represent a reduction or increase in cash available to us 
adjusted ebitda is a measure that may be unique to us  and therefore it may not enhance the comparability of our results to other companies in our industry 
management compensates for these limitations by also relying on the comparable gaap financial measure of net income attributable to yahoo inc  which includes taxes  depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation expense  other income  net which includes interest  earnings in equity interests  net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and the other gains  losses and expenses that are excluded from adjusted ebitda 
free cash flow 
free cash flow is a non gaap financial measure defined as net cash provided by used in operating activities adjusted to include excess tax benefits from stock based awards  less acquisition of property and equipment  net and dividends received from equity investees 
we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure which provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the acquisition of property and equipment  which can then be used for strategic opportunities including  among others  investing in our business  making strategic acquisitions  strengthening the balance sheet  and repurchasing stock 
a limitation of free cash flow is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period 
management compensates for the limitation of free cash flow by also relying on the net change in cash and cash equivalents as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows prepared in accordance with gaap which incorporates all cash movements during the period 
significant transactions initial repurchase of alibaba group holding limited ordinary shares on september  the repurchase closing date  alibaba group holding limited alibaba group repurchased the initial repurchase million of the  million ordinary shares of alibaba group shares owned by us 
the initial repurchase was made pursuant to the terms of the share repurchase and preference share sale agreement entered into by yahoo inc  alibaba group and yahoo hong kong holdings limited  a hong kong corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of yahoo inc yhk on may  as amended on september   the repurchase agreement 
we received per share  or approximately billion in total consideration  for the million shares sold to alibaba group 
approximately billion of the consideration was received in cash and million was received in alibaba group preference shares the alibaba group preference shares 
this initial repurchase resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately billion for the year ended december  which is included in other income  net on our consolidated statements of income 
on the repurchase closing date  alibaba group paid us million in satisfaction of certain future royalty payments under our existing technology and intellectual property license agreement tipla with alibaba group

we intend to return billion of the after tax proceeds to shareholders 
this amount includes approximately billion we returned to shareholders through share repurchases from may   the date we announced the repurchase agreement  through december  at the time of an initial public offering of alibaba group meeting certain specified criteria qualified ipo  yahoo and yhk will sell  at alibaba group s election either directly to alibaba group or in the qualified ipo  up to an additional million of our remaining shares

see note investments in equity interests in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
search agreement with microsoft corporation on december   we entered into a search and advertising services and sales agreement the search agreement with microsoft corporation microsoft  which provides for microsoft to be the exclusive algorithmic and paid search services provider on yahoo properties and non exclusive provider of such services on affiliate sites 
we also entered into a license agreement with microsoft pursuant to which microsoft acquired an exclusive year license to our core search technology that it will be able to integrate into its existing web search platforms 
the global transition of our algorithmic and paid search platforms to microsoft s platform and the migration of paid search advertisers and publishers to microsoft s platform are being done on a market by market basis 
during the first five years of the search agreement  in transitioned markets we are entitled to receive percent of the revenue generated from microsoft s services on yahoo properties 
we are also entitled to receive percent of the revenue generated from microsoft s services on affiliate sites after the affiliate s share of revenue 
in the transitioned markets  for search revenue generated from microsoft s services on yahoo properties and affiliate sites  we report as revenue the percent revenue share  as we are not the primary obligor in the arrangement with the advertisers and publishers 
the underlying search advertising services are provided by microsoft 
for new affiliates during the term of the search agreement  and for all affiliates after the first five years of such term  we will receive percent of the revenue generated from microsoft s services on affiliate sites after the affiliate s share of revenue and certain microsoft costs are deducted 
on the fifth anniversary of the date of implementation of the search agreement  microsoft will have the option to terminate our sales exclusivity for premium search advertisers 
if microsoft exercises its option  the revenue share rate will increase to percent for the remainder of the term of the search agreement  unless we exercise our option to retain our sales exclusivity  in which case the revenue share rate would be reduced to percent for the remainder of the term 
if microsoft does not exercise such option  the revenue share rate will be percent for the remainder of the term of the search agreement 
under the search agreement  for each market  microsoft generally guarantees yahoo s revenue per search rps guarantee on yahoo properties only for months after the transition of paid search services to microsoft s platform in that market 
in the fourth quarter of  microsoft agreed to extend the rps guarantee in the us and canada through march  the rps guarantee is calculated based on the difference in revenue per search between the pre transition and post transition periods and certain other factors 
we record the rps guarantee as search revenue in the quarter the amount becomes fixed  which is typically the quarter in which the associated shortfall in revenue per search occurred 
if the rps guarantee in the us and canada is not renewed prior to its expiration on march   we currently anticipate that our revenue  cash flows and income will be negatively impacted 

table of contents under the search agreement  microsoft agreed to reimburse us for certain transition costs up to an aggregate total of million during the first three years of the search agreement 
during the third quarter of  our cumulative transition costs exceeded microsoft s million reimbursement cap under the search agreement

our results reflect search operating cost reimbursements from microsoft under the search agreement of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
search operating cost reimbursements are expected to decline as we fully transition all markets and  in the long term  the underlying expenses are not expected to be incurred under our cost structure

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and 
table of contents liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about  among other things  the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure below 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

display revenue is generated from the display of graphical advertisements and search revenue is generated from the display of text based links to an advertiser s website and from revenue sharing arrangements with partners for search technology and services 
other revenue consists of listings based services revenue  transaction revenue  and fees revenue 
while the majority of our revenue transactions contain standard business terms and conditions  there are certain transactions that contain non standard business terms and conditions 
in addition  we enter into certain sales transactions that involve multiple elements arrangements with more than one deliverable 
we also enter into arrangements to purchase goods and or services from certain customers 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for these transactions including whether an arrangement exists  whether fees are fixed or determinable  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among potential multiple elements  establishing selling prices for deliverables considering multiple factors  when to recognize revenue on the deliverables  whether all elements of the arrangement have been delivered  whether the arrangement should be reported gross as a principal versus net as an agent  whether we receive a separately identifiable benefit from the purchase arrangements with certain customers for which we can reasonably estimate fair value  and whether the consideration received from a vendor should be characterized as revenue or a reimbursement of costs incurred 
in addition  our revenue recognition policy requires an assessment as to whether collection is reasonably assured  which inherently requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers 
changes in judgments on these assumptions and estimates could materially impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition 
income taxes 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
see note income taxes in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we establish reserves for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
these reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are in accordance with applicable tax laws 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit  new tax legislation  or the change of an estimate based on new information 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest and penalties 
we record a valuation allowance against certain of our deferred income tax assets if it is more likely than not that those assets will not be realized 
in evaluating our ability to realize our deferred income tax assets we consider all 
table of contents available positive and negative evidence  including our operating results  ongoing tax planning  and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize these deferred income tax assets in the future  we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance  which would reduce the provision for income taxes 
goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized  but is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
the performance of the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step involves comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values  including goodwill 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the test is performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill in the reporting unit to its implied fair value 
an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value 
our reporting units are based on geography  either at the operating segment level or one level below operating segments 
the fair values of our reporting units are estimated using an average of a market approach and an income approach as this combination is deemed to be the most indicative of our fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants and is consistent with the methodology used for the goodwill impairment test in prior years 
in addition  we ensure that the fair values estimated under these two approaches are comparable with each other 
under the market approach  we utilize publicly traded comparable company information to determine revenue and earnings multiples that are used to value our reporting units adjusted for an estimated control premium 
under the income approach  we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted by an estimated weighted average cost of capital  reflecting the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including selection of market comparables  estimated future cash flows  and discount rates 
these components are discussed below market comparables we select comparable companies in the specific regions in which our reporting units operate based on similarity of type of business  primarily those involved in online advertising  relative size  financial profile  and other characteristics of those companies compared to our reporting units 
trailing and forward revenue and earnings multiples derived from these comparable companies are applied to financial metrics of each reporting unit to determine their estimated fair values  adjusted for an estimated control premium 
estimated future cash flows we base cash flow projections for each reporting unit using a five year forecast of cash flows and a terminal value based on the perpetuity growth model 
the five year forecast and related assumptions were derived from the most recent annual financial forecast for which the planning process commenced in our fourth quarter 
key assumptions in estimating future cash flows include  among other items  revenue and operating expense growth rates  terminal value growth rate  and capital expenditure and working capital levels 
discount rates we employ a weighted average cost of capital wacc approach to determine the discount rates used in our cash flow projections 
the determination of the discount rates for each reporting unit includes factors such as the risk free rate of return and the return an outside investor would expect to earn based on the overall level of inherent risk 
the determination of expected returns includes consideration of the beta a measure of risk of traded securities of comparable companies and risk premiums of reporting units based on international cost of capital methods 
the sum of the fair values of our reporting units is reconciled to our market capitalization after considering an estimated control premium 

table of contents we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test as of october  and determined that the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and therefore goodwill in those reporting units was not impaired 
significant management judgment is involved in determining these estimates and assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit which could trigger future impairment 
long lived assets 
we amortize long lived assets over their estimated useful lives 
identifiable long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value 
fair value is determined based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated future cash flows using discount rates determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model 
our estimates of future cash flows attributable to our long lived assets require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors 
different assumptions and judgments could materially affect estimated future cash flows relating to our long lived assets which could trigger impairment 
no impairments of long lived assets were identified during any of the periods presented 
investments in equity interests 
we account for investments in the common stock of entities in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence but do not own a majority equity interest or otherwise control using the equity method 
in accounting for these investments we record our proportionate share of the entities net income or loss  one quarter in arrears 
we review our investments in equity interests for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment may not be fully recoverable 
investments identified as having an indication of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the impairment is other than temporary and this analysis requires estimating the fair value of the investment 
the determination of fair value of the investment involves considering factors such as the stock prices of public companies in which we have an equity investment  current economic and market conditions  the operating performance of the companies  including current earnings trends and forecasted cash flows  and other company and industry specific information 
the fair value determination  particularly for investments in privately held companies  requires significant judgment to determine appropriate estimates and assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the calculation of the fair value of the investments and the determination of whether any identified impairment is other than temporary 
stock based compensation expense 
we recognize stock based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate and therefore only recognize compensation expense for those shares expected to vest over the service period of the award 
calculating stock based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected term of the stock based options  stock price volatility  and the pre vesting award forfeiture rate 
we estimate the expected life of options granted based on historical exercise patterns  which we believe are representative of future behavior 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock on the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded options on our common stock  with a term of one year or greater 
we believe that implied volatility calculated based on actively traded options on our common stock is a better indicator of expected volatility and future stock price trends than historical volatility 
therefore  expected volatility for the year ended december  was based on a market based implied volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected pre vesting award forfeiture rate  as 
table of contents well as the probability that performance conditions that affect the vesting of certain awards will be achieved  and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
we estimate this forfeiture rate based on historical experience of our stock based awards that are granted and cancelled before vesting 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our original estimates  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stock based compensation expense  as the effect of adjusting the forfeiture rate for all current and previously recognized expense for unvested awards is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
in addition  because many of our stock based awards have vesting schedules of two or three year cliff vests  a significant change in our actual or expected forfeiture experience will result in the adjustment of stock based compensation which was recorded in prior years for all unvested awards 
if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment will be made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate  which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment will be made to lower the estimated forfeiture rate  which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates and changes in the market values of our investments 
we may use derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain risks in accordance with our investment and foreign exchange policies 
we do not use derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate exposure our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates impacts our costs associated with hedging  and primarily relates to our cash and marketable debt securities portfolio 
we invest excess cash in money market funds  time deposits  and liquid debt instruments of the us and foreign governments and their agencies  us municipalities  and high credit corporate issuers which are classified as marketable debt securities and cash equivalents 
investments in fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in a million and million decrease in the fair value of our available for sale debt securities as of december  and  respectively 
foreign currency exposure our foreign currency exposure continues to increase as we grow internationally 
the objective of our foreign exchange risk management program is to identify material foreign currency exposures and identify methods to manage these exposures to minimize the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flows and results of operations 
counterparties to our derivative contracts are all major institutions 
we transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenue  as well as costs denominated in foreign currencies 
this exposes us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

table of contents our objective is to identify material foreign currency exposures and to manage these exposures to minimize the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flow and results of operations 
we had net realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction losses of million for the year ended december  our net realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we categorize our foreign currency exposure as follows net investment  balance sheet  and translation 
net investment exposure 
in december  we began hedging  on an after tax basis  our net investment in yahoo japan with forward contracts to reduce the risk that our investment in yahoo japan will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the forward contracts have maturities ranging from to months 
if the japanese yen appreciates at maturity from the forward contract execution rates  the forward contracts will require us to pay a cash settlement  which may be material 
if the japanese yen depreciates at maturity from the forward contract execution rates  we will receive a cash settlement  which may be material 
we have elected to apply net investment hedge accounting and expect the hedges to be effective  allowing changes in fair value of the derivative instrument to be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet 
the notional amounts of the foreign currency forward contracts related to our net investment hedge were billion as of december  the fair value of the foreign currency contracts was million as of december  and is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
a gain of million was recorded for the year ended december  and is included in accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet 
balance sheet exposure 
we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these derivative instruments hedge assets and liabilities  including intercompany transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies 
the balance sheet hedges are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded in other income  net on our consolidated statements of income 
these derivative instruments do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset gains or losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged 
the notional amounts of the foreign currency forward contracts were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we did not enter into any derivative instruments in fiscal year the fair value of the foreign currency forward contract liability was million and million as of december  and  respectively  and was recorded as a gain of million and loss of million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
translation exposure 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we convert the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries and our investments in equity interests into us dollars in consolidation 
if there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates  the conversion of the foreign subsidiaries financial statements into us dollars results in a gain or loss which is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income which is part of stockholders equity 
we do not hedge our exposure to foreign currency risks arising from translation  except for the japanese yen forward contracts entered into related to our investment in yahoo japan 
a value at risk var sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign currency derivative positions as of december  and december  to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates 
the var model uses a monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random price paths assuming normal market conditions 
the var is the maximum expected one day loss in fair value  for a given statistical confidence level  to our foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates 
the var model is used as a risk management tool and is not intended to represent either actual or forecasted losses 
based on the results of the model using a percent confidence interval  we estimate the maximum one day loss in fair value is million on the notional value of our balance sheet hedges at december  compared to a million loss at december  the maximum one day loss in fair value is million on the notional value of the net investment hedges at december  there were no net investment hedges outstanding at december  
table of contents actual future gains and losses associated with our derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analysis performed as of december  due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and our actual exposures and positions 
in addition  the var sensitivity analysis may not reflect the complex market reactions that may arise from the market shifts modeled within this var sensitivity analysis 
revenue ex tac and related expenses generated from our international subsidiaries are generally denominated in the currencies of the local countries 
primary currencies include australian dollars  british pounds  euros  japanese yen  korean won  and taiwan dollars 
the statements of income of our international operations are translated into us dollars at exchange rates indicative of market rates during each applicable period 
to the extent the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in reduced consolidated revenue and operating expenses 
conversely  our consolidated revenue and operating expenses will increase if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies 
using the foreign currency exchange rates from the year ended december   revenue ex tac for the americas segment for the year ended december  would have been higher than we reported by million  revenue ex tac for the emea segment would have been higher than we reported by million  and revenue ex tac for the asia pacific segment would have been higher than we reported by million 
using the foreign currency exchange rates from the year ended december   direct costs for the americas segment for the year ended december  would have been higher than we reported by million  direct costs for the emea segment would have been higher than we reported by million  and direct costs for the asia pacific segment would have been higher than we reported by million 
investment exposure we are exposed to investment risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments 
we have investments in marketable debt securities and equity instruments of public and private companies 
our cash and marketable debt securities investment policy and strategy attempts primarily to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements 
a large portion of our cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of our investment policy 
we protect and preserve invested funds by limiting default  market  and reinvestment risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of liquid fixed income securities  including both government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
as of december  and  net unrealized gains and losses on these investments were not material 
alibaba group preference shares exposure 
to estimate the fair value of the alibaba group preference shares  we performed benchmarking by comparing the terms and conditions of the alibaba group preference shares to dividend rates  subordination terms  and credit ratings of those of similar type instruments 
the credit rating of alibaba group  general business conditions  and market rates could materially affect the fair value of the alibaba group preference shares
