in april  we effected a for stock split 
we made cash payments based upon the closing price of our shares on the record date in lieu of the issuance of fractional shares 
share and per share information in this report  including in our financial statements  reflect the impact of the stock split 
on march   we amended our senior note payable that provided for updated financial covenants in exchange for an increase in the floor interest rate from to 
see note in the accompanying financial statements for more information 
under the continued guidance and direction of our directors and chief executive officer  asure will continue to implement its corporate strategy for growing its software and services business 
however  uncertainties and challenges remain and there can be no assurances that asure can successfully grow its revenues or achieve profitability and positive cash flows during calendar year revenues our revenues in were million  as compared to million for revenues represent our consolidated revenues  including sales of our scheduling software  time and attendance and human resource software  complementary hardware devices to enhance our software products  software maintenance and support services  installation and training services and other professional services 
revenues increased by million  or  in as compared to this revenue increase is due primarily to our adi and legiant acquisitions in the fourth quarter of and our peoplecube acquisition in july we attribute million of the revenue increase to the full year of adi and legiant revenues  consisting of million increase in software subscription revenue  million in hardware revenue  million in maintenance revenue   in onetime software license revenue and  in professional services revenue 
we attribute million of the revenue increase to six months of revenues from peoplecube  consisting primarily of million in software subscription revenue  million in maintenance revenue   in professional services revenue   in onetime software license revenue and  in hardware revenue 
iemployee and meeting room manager software solutions revenues remained level at million for and 
table of contents meeting room manager revenues were million in this compares to revenues of million in iemployee revenues were million in  as compared to million in meeting room manager revenues increased  overall from and iemployee revenues decreased  from  primarily driven by an increase in our cloud based software subscriptions and a decrease in our software licenses  as we focused more on asure s cloud based software solutions 
we deliver our software to customers under the saas model on a subscription basis 
in recent times  this type of software subscription has become known as cloud based software subscriptions in addition to being referred to as a saas model 
when purchasing any of asure s cloud based software solutions  customers do not need to install or maintain the software on their own servers 
additionally  purchasing an annual subscription may not require as stringent approval requirements as purchasing a perpetual license 
thus  we believe that purchasing our products on a subscription basis is becoming more appealing to customers as they try to meet operational goals while reducing capital expenditures 
our meeting room manager cloud based software subscription revenue for increased  or  over revenues  while our meeting room manager software license revenues decreased  or  as compared to iemployee software subscription revenue decreased by  or 
this was due to turning focus away from the iemployee software subscription product and focusing on the adi software subscription solutions 
we attribute our meeting room manager software subscription increases to a combination of new sales and the accretive nature of recurring subscription revenue 
during  software license revenues increased  as compared the full year of revenues for adi and legiant contributed to  of this increase 
peoplecube comprised  of the increase 
meeting room manager software license revenues decreased  or  as compared to the company continues to focus efforts on the repetitive nature of its meeting room manager on demand software subscription product as an alternative to the one time nature of its perpetual  in house software solution

adi and legiant contributed million to this increase 
peoplecube had million of maintenance revenue in  offset by a slight decrease in iemployee and meeting room manager maintenance revenue of  as compared to contributing to this overall increase was new onetime license sales  and aggressive focus on both retaining and winning back maintenance customers  as well as the continued enforcement of our auto renew provision absent sufficient notice to our annual maintenance contracts 
professional services revenue increased million in over adi and legiant contributed  to this increase 
peoplecube had  of professional services revenue in iemployee and meeting room manager professional services revenue increased  in as compared to  reflecting price increases which were initiated in early although our sales are concentrated in certain industries  including corporate  education  healthcare  governmental  legal and non profit  our total customer base is widely spread across industries 
geographically  we sell our products worldwide  but sales are largely concentrated in the united states and canada 
additionally  asure has a distribution partner in australia 
for  asure continued to target small and medium businesses and divisions of enterprises in these same industries 
as the overall workforce management solutions market continues to experience significant growth related to saas products  asure will continue to focus on sales of its meeting room manager on demand  peoplecube and adi saas products

income taxes at december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  r d credit carryforwards of approximately million and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of approximately  the net operating loss and r d credit carryforwards will expire in varying amounts from through  if not utilized 
minimum tax credit carryforwards carry forward indefinitely 
income tax expense increased to  in  compared to an expense of  in these figures represent an effective tax rate of and in and  respectively 
the income tax expense  and the increase from  is primarily due to deferred taxes on the amortization of goodwill for tax purposes and the results of foreign operations 
as a result of our various acquisitions in prior years  we may be subject to a substantial annual limitation in the utilization of the net operating losses and credit carryforwards due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of realizing the benefits of our favorable tax attributes in future tax returns  we have placed a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset  exclusive of goodwill 
during  we decreased the valuation allowance by approximately million due primarily to operations  including expiration of tax carryforwards 
the valuation allowance also increased by approximately million in due to the acquisition of peoplecube 
approximately million of the valuation allowance relates to tax benefits for stock option deductions included in our net operating loss carryforward which we will allocate  if and when realized  directly to contributed capital to the extent the benefits exceed amounts attributable to book deferred compensation expense 
we consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries permanently reinvested and  accordingly  we have not provided for us federal or state income taxes thereon

deferred revenue is an obligation to perform future services 
it should be converted to future revenue  but does not represent future payments 
we attribute the decrease in our working capital to  of payments on our line of credit and a million increase in current notes payable  together with an increase in accounts payable of million and an increase in deferred revenue of million in compared to  primarily due to our peoplecube acquisition in july

cash provided by financing activities during was million 
we incurred million of debt principally to fund the acquisitions of adi and legiant 
as of december   asure s principal source of liquidity consisted of approximately million of current cash and cash equivalents as well as future cash generated from operations 
we believe that we currently have and or will generate sufficient cash for our operational needs  including any required debt payments  for at least the next twelve months 
we continue to reduce expenses and may utilize some of our cash balances in the short term to reduce our long term costs 
we currently project that we can generate positive cash flows from our operating activities in our management team is focused on growing our existing software operations and is also seeking additional strategic acquisitions for the near future  although we have no current agreements to acquire any technology or business 
at present  we plan to fund any future acquisition with equity  existing cash  cash generated from future operations and or cash or debt raised from outside sources 
we have determined that we have not been in compliance with certain of our financial covenants  including minimum ebitda  under our loan agreement with deerpath funding  lp as of december  deerpath did not declare the loan in default while we were not in compliance 
on march   but effective as of december   we amended our loan agreement with deerpath funding  lp 
under the amended agreement  deerpath increased by  to  in the aggregate its conditional commitment to provide us additional single advance senior secured terms loans from time to time for refinancing certain other indebtedness  funding permitted acquisitions or other growth initiatives and paying fees and expenses of the term loans and permitted acquisitions 
in addition  deerpath eliminated the requirement for us to maintain certain minimum ebitda levels during the loan term and modified other financial covenants as discussed below 
in exchange  we agreed to an increase in the term loan interest rate from a floating annual rate of libor plus to libor plus and an increase in the floor interest rate from to 
in addition to continuing our monthly interest payments and quarterly principal payments  we further agreed to make a separate  principal payment by october  however  if we do not make the  principal payment by may   the interest rate on that portion of the entire term loan will increase by until paid 
in addition  we agreed to pay a  loan amendment fee 
we also agreed to revised financial covenants 
beginning with the quarter ending march   we agreed to a total debt to ebitda ratio of not greater than to formerly to beginning with that period  with the levels stepping down thereafter to to for the quarter ending march  and thereafter formerly to for those periods 
beginning with the quarter ended december   we agreed to a senior debt to ebitda ratio of not greater than to formerly to beginning with that period with the levels stepping down thereafter to to for the quarter ending december  and thereafter formerly to for those periods 
other financial covenants remain unchanged 
we are in compliance with the amended covenant requirements as of december  and expect to be incompliance over the subsequent twelve month period 
we cannot assure that we can grow our cash balances or limit our cash consumption and thus maintain sufficient cash balances for our planned operations or future acquisitions 
future business demands may lead to cash utilization at levels greater than recently experienced 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future  including making the required  principal payment to deerpath funding  lp 
however  we cannot assure that we will be able to raise additional capital on acceptable terms  or at all 
critical accounting policies we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and including the accounts of asure s wholly owned subsidiaries 
we have eliminated all significant intercompany transactions and balances in the consolidation 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates are subjective in nature and involve judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at fiscal year end and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the fiscal year 
the more significant estimates made by management include the valuation allowance for our gross deferred tax asset  lease impairment  useful lives of fixed assets  the determination of the fair value of our long lived assets and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed during acquisitions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the given circumstances 
these estimates could be materially different under different conditions and assumptions 
additionally  the actual amounts could differ from the estimates made 
management periodically evaluates estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements for continued reasonableness 
we prospectively apply appropriate adjustments  if any  to our estimates based upon our periodic evaluation 

table of contents we believe the following are our critical accounting policies revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable 
we recognize software revenue in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition 
our revenues consist of software license  software subscription and service fees 
we earn revenue from the software element through the licensing or right to use our software and from the sale of specific software products 
we earn service fee income through the sale of maintenance and technical support  training and installation 
we recognize revenue from the sale of hardware devices upon shipment of the hardware 
asure also sells multiple elements within a single sale 
since we currently offer software both as a perpetual license and as software as a service  revenue recognition varies based on which of these forms of software the customer purchases 
when we sell software licenses in a multiple element arrangement and we have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for the undelivered element  we recognize sales revenue on the date we ship the product  using the residual method  deferring the unearned portion of revenue due to the applicable undelivered elements 
we base vsoe of fair value for our maintenance  training and installation services on the prices charged for these services when sold separately 
generally  we restrict the undelivered elements for our multiple element arrangements with a customer to post contract support  training and installation services 
we apply the vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements to allocate the amount of revenue to them 
we recognize deferred revenue due to undelivered elements ratably on a straight line basis over the service period typically one year or when we complete the service 
when we cannot determine vsoe of fair value for the undelivered element of a multiple element arrangement  we generally recognize sales revenue on the entire arrangement ratably on a straight line basis over the service period of the undelivered element 
we believe that our training and installation services are not essential to the functionality of our products  as third parties or customers themselves can provide these services 
we also sell software subscriptions and may at times sell related setup  implementation and professional services in the same arrangement 
setup and implementation services typically occur at start of the software subscription period  while certain professional services may not occur until several months later depending on the nature of the services and the customer requirements 
we allocate the value of the arrangement to each separate unit of accounting based on vsoe of selling price  when it exists  third party evidence of selling prices for like services or an estimated selling price 
we recognize software subscription service revenues pro rata over the life of the software subscription contract  while we recognize the related setup  implementation or professional services revenues upon service completion 
we do not recognize revenue for agreements with rights of return  refundable fees  cancellation rights or acceptance clauses until these return  refund or cancellation rights have expired or acceptance has occurred 
our arrangements with resellers do not allow for any rights of return 
deferred revenue includes amounts received from customers in excess of revenue recognized  and is comprised of deferred maintenance  service and other revenue 
we recognize deferred revenues when we complete the service and over the terms of the arrangements  primarily ranging from one to three years 
intangible assets and goodwill we record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition  with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill 
valuation of intangible assets and in process research and development entails significant estimates and assumptions including  but not limited to  estimating future cash flows from product sales  developing appropriate discount rates  estimating probability rates for the continuation of customer relationships and renewal of customer contracts and approximating the useful lives of the intangible assets acquired 
us generally accepted accounting principles gaap require that we not amortize intangible assets other than goodwill with an indefinite life until we determine their life as finite 
we must amortize all other intangible assets over their useful lives 
we currently amortize our acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods ranging from one to nine years 
impairment of intangible assets and long lived assets in accordance with fasb asc  we review and evaluate our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not recover their net book value 
when such factors and circumstances exist  including those noted above  we compare the assets carrying amounts against the estimated undiscounted cash flows we expect to generate with those assets over their estimated useful lives 
if the carrying amounts are greater than the undiscounted cash flows  we estimate the fair values of those assets by discounting the projected cash flows 
we record any excess of the carrying amounts over the fair values as impairments in that fiscal period 

table of contents goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year  and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist  using a fair value based approach 
there has been no impairment of goodwill for the periods presented 
see notes and in the accompanying financial statements for additional information regarding goodwill 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued asu topic fair value measurement 
the new guidance creates a uniform framework for applying fair value measurement principles 
it eliminates differences between gaap and international financial reporting standards issued by the international accounting standards board 
new disclosures required by the guidance include quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used for level measurements  a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of recurring level measurements to changes in the unobservable inputs disclosed  including the interrelationship between inputs  and a description of the company s valuation processes 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   and companies apply all amendments prospectively with any changes in measurements recognized in income in the period of adoption 
the adoption of these standards did not materially affect our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued asu topic comprehensive income 
the new guidance amends disclosure requirements for the presentation of comprehensive income 
the amended guidance eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income oci as part of the statement of changes in shareholders equity 
companies must present all changes in oci either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive financial statements 
the guidance does not change the items that companies must report in oci 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim reporting periods within those years beginning after december  with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of this guidance did not materially impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows and only impacts the presentation of oci in the consolidated financial statements 
we adopted these standards in the first quarter of fiscal in september  the fasb issued asu no 
amending accounting related to goodwill impairment testing 
asu allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
under these amendments  an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the amendments include a number of events and circumstances for an entity to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment 
asu is effective for impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  we have not applied the optional requirements of asu in our goodwill impairment testing 
in july  the fasb issued asu amending accounting standards related to impairment testing for indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill 
asu allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets 
an entity that elects to perform a qualitative assessment no longer is required to perform the quantitative impairment test for an indefinite lived intangible asset if it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired 
asu is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   with early adoption permitted 
we have not applied the optional requirements of asu in our indefinite lived intangible assets impairment testing
