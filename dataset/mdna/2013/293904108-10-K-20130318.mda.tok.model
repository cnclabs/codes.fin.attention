overview we are a biotechnology company that had been dedicated to the research and development of innovative therapeutics for patients with high unmet medical needs 
we receive royalty revenues from licensing arrangements with other companies related to sales of products developed using our proprietary customized pegylation linker technology customized linker technology 
we receive royalties on seven marketed products that utilize our proprietary pegylation platform  namely pegintron  sylatron  macugen  cimzia  omontys  oncaspar and adagen 
the primary source of our royalty revenue is pegintron  which is marketed by merck 
in december  we announced that our board of directors retained lazard fr res co 
llc lazard to act as financial advisor in a review of the possible sale or disposition of one or more corporate assets or a sale of our company and that our board of directors established a special committee to oversee our sale review process 
in connection with our sale review process  we have substantially suspended all clinical development activities with a goal of conserving capital and maximizing value returned to our stockholders 
our sale review process entails numerous significant risks and uncertainties  including the risks and uncertainties set forth in item a 
risk factors of this annual report on form k 
there can be no assurance that our sale review process will result in any transaction 
prior to the substantial suspension of our clinical development activities  we i maintained drug development programs utilizing two platforms customized pegylation linker technology customized linker technology and third generation messenger ribonucleic acid mrna antagonists utilizing the locked nucleic acid lna technology  ii had three compounds in human clinical development  a pegylated version of the active metabolite of the cancer drug irinotecan  peg sn  and mrna antagonists targeting hypoxia inducible factor hif and the androgen receptor ar  and iii had novel mrna antagonist targets in various stages of preclinical research 
prior to january   we were a biopharmaceutical company involved in the development  manufacture  and commercialization of medicines for patients with cancer and other life threatening conditions and had operated in three business segments comprised of a products segment  royalties segment  and a contract manufacturing segment 
on january   we consummated the sale of our former specialty pharmaceutical business comprised principally of our former products and the contract manufacturing segments 
for financial reporting purposes  beginning in  the operations and cash flows of our former products and contract manufacturing segments were eliminated from our continuing operations and classified as discontinued operations 
the sale of our former specialty pharmaceutical business also involved the sale of certain in process research and development associated with the divested products  which resulted in the potential receipt of certain contingent milestone payments  the potential receipt of certain royalties  and our provision of various transitional services to the purchaser

general and administrative general and administrative contracted services impairment of property and equipment restructuring charges 
operating loss other expense  net income tax expense benefit loss from continuing operations overview the sale of our former specialty pharmaceutical business in january had numerous effects on our financial results and makes year to year comparisons and inferences regarding future trends difficult 
even after reclassifying the majority of revenues and expenses of the divested business as discontinued operations  several large and unique items remain that are reported as part of continuing operations but that are not expected to be recurring events the sale of in process research and development for million in and the related million milestone payment received in were part of the total sale of our former specialty pharmaceutical business but are reported as part of continuing operations because we had operated as a research and development organization 
revenues from a transition services agreement entered into with the purchaser of our former specialty pharmaceutical business totaling million in contract research and development and the majority of miscellaneous income diminished significantly in and operating expenses for research and development contracted services in largely represented the expenses incurred million in support of the transition services revenues mentioned above and also diminished significantly in and to approximately million and million  respectively 
also in this caption are the expenses incurred by us prior to the sale of our former specialty pharmaceutical business in support of the products we owned at that time million in 

del del 
in  there was a reduction in our restructuring charge of million 
after taking the aforementioned items and the restructuring charges of million and million in and  respectively  into account  visibility of the underlying trends we have experienced in royalty revenues  research and development spending and general and administrative expenses is enhanced 
these and other elements of our statements of operations are discussed more fully in the below sections 
royalty revenues in millions of dollars year ended december  change change royalty revenue the majority of royalty revenue relates to sales of pegintron  a peg enhanced version of the alpha interferon product  intron a  marketed by merck  for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c 
the following table summarizes our pegintron royalties earned pegintron royalties from in millions of dollars year ended december  change change us sales foreign sales europe foreign sales japan foreign sales other total other royalty revenues and certain licensing revenues relate to the application of our technology to third party products including those under a cross license agreement with nektar therapeutics  inc nektar under which we receive a share of the royalties and licensing income received by nektar 
there are currently three third party products for which nektar has granted sublicenses to our pegylation technology and for which we are participating in royalty and licensing income revenues ucb s cimzia for the treatment of crohn s disease and rheumatoid arthritis in the european union  osi and pfizer s macugen for the treatment of neovascular wet age related macular degeneration  and takeda and affymax s omontys for the treatment of anemia due to chronic kidney disease ckd in adult patients on dialysis 
we are also entitled to royalties from the purchaser of our former specialty pharmaceutical business of to percent on incremental net sales above a baseline amount through from the four marketed products we sold to them 
royalty revenue increased approximately percent in compared to this was driven almost entirely by a increase in royalties on cimzia compared to royalties on pegintron in were flat versus macugen royalties in declined compared to royalty revenue for omontys in the amount of million was recorded for the first time in on february   affymax and takeda announced a nationwide voluntary recall of all lots of omontys peginesatide injection as a result of new postmarketing reports regarding serious hypersensitivity reactions  including anaphylaxis  which can be life threatening or fatal 
this recall will negatively affect our future royalty revenues from omontys 
royalty revenue declined approximately percent in compared to this was driven almost entirely by lower sales of pegintron  which also declined approximately percent during the same period 
royalties on net sales of cimzia and macugen were relatively flat for versus  while royalties on the on net sales of the four divested marketed products declined by approximately year over year 
our future revenues are heavily weighted towards royalties and revenues to be received from the use of our technology and are dependent upon numerous factors outside of our control 
we derive almost all of our royalties from sales of pegintron  which have been in decline since merck s obligation to pay us royalties on sales of pegintron terminates  on a country by country basis  upon the later of the date on which the last patent to contain a claim covering pegintron expires in the country or years after the date on which pegintron is first approved for commercial marketing in such country 
currently  expirations of our right to receive royalties are expected to occur in in the us  in europe and in japan 
other factors potentially affecting our royalty revenues include new or increased competition from products that may compete with the products for which we receive royalties  the effectiveness of marketing by our licensees  and new uses and geographies for pegintron  cimzia  macugen  and omontys 
our rights to receive royalties on cimzia  macugen  and omontys will terminate in after the expiration of the patents and royalties  we are entitled to immunity fees on a country by country and product by product basis for up to twelve years from the date of first sale of these drugs 
sale of in process research and development when we sold our former specialty pharmaceutical business  we had retained our research and development organization 
we had been engaged in studies oriented towards the next generation formulations of oncaspar and adagen  two products that were among those sold as part of our former specialty pharmaceutical business 
no revenue was recognized in the in process research and development related to oncaspar and adagen was sold to the purchaser of our former specialty pharmaceutical business and  in connection with the sale  million was recognized as revenue in the first quarter of during the first quarter of  we earned and recognized an additional million milestone payment related to divested in process research and development 
the selling price of the in process research and development represented management s best estimate of its standalone fair value based on the stage of development and future milestone payment consideration 
all necessary technology and know how were transferred to the purchaser at the time of the sale and the purchaser could resell the in process research and development asset 
at the time of the sale  the activities necessary to complete the work on the oncaspar and adagen next generation formulations could have been performed by the purchaser or others 
contract research and development revenue pursuant to a transition services agreement entered into at the time of the sale of our former specialty pharmaceutical business  we began performing product support research and development  consulting and technology transfer functions for the purchaser effective with the close of the sale transaction on january  the transition services associated with product support research and development are being reported in continuing operations due to our ongoing involvement in the research and development related to the divested products 
we are being compensated for this work at actual cost plus a mark up per the terms of the transition services agreement 
revenue was generated from these services in the amount of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
our contractual obligation is to assist with these transition services for a period of up to three years subsequent to the date of the sale  although the level of such activity declined significantly during and the transition services agreement was terminated by the purchaser on september  miscellaneous income miscellaneous income includes rental receipts totaling approximately million and million in and  respectively  in connection with the sublease of unused manufacturing and excess office facilities for which we have ongoing lease commitments 
the underlying rental expense is reflected in general and administrative expense 
in addition  during the second quarter of  we received a non refundable  non creditable upfront payment of million related to the licensing of peg sn as part of the collaboration agreement with hisun 
also  as part of the transition services agreement referred to above  we were compensated for various general and administrative services provided to the purchaser of our former specialty pharmaceutical business 
the compensation for this work includes reimbursement of costs incurred plus a mark up defined in the agreement 
approximately million and million have been earned for the services in each of the years ended december  and  respectively 
the expenses incurred in relation to these services are reported as general and administrative contracted services 
our involvement in the transitioning of general and administrative activities was essentially concluded during research and development expenses pipeline in millions of dollars year ended december  change change research and development expenses the following table summarizes our major pipeline research and development projects  the costs incurred for the years ended december   and and the latest phases of development millions of dollars for the years ended december  category latest phase of development peg sn phase i and phase ii hif a antagonist phase i survivin antagonist phase i  returned to santaris androgen receptor antagonist phase i depreciation additional lna targets pre clinical pegylation technology pre clinical other r d costs pipeline total r d pipeline in  depreciation was allocated by project  but thereafter it was not 
in and  expenses for pegylation technology were allocated separately  while they were included in other r d costs 
research and development expenses consist primarily of contractor fees principally related to clinical projects  costs related to research and development collaborations or licenses  drug supplies for preclinical and clinical activities  salaries  stock based compensation and benefits  other research supplies and facilities charges 
program costs are those research and development costs which are directly related to specific programs that are tracked and managed at the individual program level 
other research and development costs are those costs incurred related to the company s on going research and development activities  such as some personnel and facilities related expenses  which are not allocated to specific programs given their general nature 
for the year ended december   research and development expenses decreased percent to million 
we invested in the following programs during peg sn spending on peg sn decreased in as clinical activity decreased 
spending on peg sn increased in as clinical activity increased in the phase ii metastatic colorectal cancer study  the phase ii metastatic breast cancer study  and the phase i pediatric study 
enrollment stopped in in the phase i pediatric study  and stopped in the two phase ii studies in additionally  a phase i study of peg sn and bevacizumab at the national cancer institute  bethesda  md  in patients who failed multiple prior chemotherapy regimens continued to enroll patients in under an ind held by the national cancer institute 
hif antagonist spending on the hif antagonist program decreased in versus spending for was substantially lower than due to having completed enrollment in the two phase i studies 
a pilot study in patients with cancer in the liver remains open at the national cancer institute under an ind held by the national cancer institute 
survivin antagonist spending on the survivin mrna antagonist program decreased in versus due to having completed enrollment in the phase i study 
in late  enzon returned this project to santaris 
androgen receptor ar antagonist spending on the ar mrna antagonist program remained stable in versus as the phase i study in patients with castrate resistant prostate cancer continued to accrue patients 
in december  enzon decided to suspend clinical development of this program 
additional lna targets under our agreement with santaris  we have the right to develop and commercialize rna antagonists directed against additional novel oncology gene targets selected by us which were her and catenin 
this agreement provides that any one of the compounds licensed by us could be returned to santaris if the findings of our preclinical or clinical work do not support our continued investment we returned three of the targets to santaris during and one target to santaris during in  we incurred milestone payments totaling million for the commencement of preclinical studies for three of our targets in addition to the million milestone payment for the ar antagonist ind referred to above 
in and  there were no milestone payments made to santaris on our remaining targets 
research and development expenses specialty and contracted services expenses associated with generating contract research and development revenue amounted to million and million in and  respectively 
also included in the line caption are the million of costs for the period from january through january  incurred in our research and development activities related to the marketed products we previously owned 
this work was directed largely towards development of new formulations of oncaspar and adagen 
general and administrative expenses in millions of dollars year ended december  change change general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for support functions  outside professional services for accounting  audit  tax  legal  and financing activities  depreciation  patent filing fees and facilities costs 
for the year ended december   general and administrative expenses were million  down percent from the prior year 
the decline in from was largely the result of a continued restructuring program 
others factors included a reduction in force and lower contractor services  insurance  rent  stock compensation expense  depreciation  and auditing accounting fees 
in addition  during the second quarter of  we recognized million for severance payments and benefits related to the departure of our former principal executive officer  chief operating officer  executive vice president and chief financial officer that were payable under the terms of her severance and release agreement 
for the year ended december   general and administrative expenses were million  down percent from the prior year 
the decline from the preceding year was largely the result of a restructuring program implemented in the fourth quarter of  which reduced the number of employees and therefore the associated payroll costs  as well as the effects of our on going cost containment efforts  including consolidation of facilities into the piscataway  new jersey location from our former bridgewater  new jersey headquarters facility 
general and administrative expenses contracted services as part of the transition services agreement with the purchaser of our former specialty pharmaceutical business  we provided certain general  administrative  financial  legal  human resource and information technology services for a period of up to one year 
we were compensated for these services based upon costs incurred plus a mark up defined in the transition services agreement 
during the years ended december    and expenses associated with generating this revenue were approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
this administrative support activity effectively concluded during impairment of property and equipment we continually evaluate property and equipment  including leasehold improvements  to determine whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that may warrant revision of the estimated useful life or whether the remaining balance should be evaluated for possible impairment 
we use an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the property and equipment in assessing whether an asset has been impaired 
we measure impairment losses based upon the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information about our fair value of property and equipment 
for the year ended december   we recorded million of non cash impairment charges related to our property and equipment to reduce the carrying value of these assets to fair market value 
these charges mostly relate to leasehold improvements representing the company s process development laboratory and related equipment and were considered necessary in view of the company s announcement of plans to suspend all clinical development activities 
restructuring in december  we made an announcement that contemplated a reduction in our workforce of approximately employees 
we expect that we will incur approximately million in charges in related to this reduction in force  all of which would result in cash expenditures for one time employee termination benefits and associated costs 
these changes are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  included in this annual report on form k 
as a result of our transition from a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company with research  manufacturing and marketing operations to a biotechnology company dedicated to oncology research and development  we undertook reductions in our workforce during  and in connection with our decision to exit our former headquarters facility in bridgewater  new jersey  we also incurred lease related charges and wrote off certain furnishings and leasehold improvements in and we incurred the following costs in connection with our restructuring programs during the years ended december   and in thousands of dollars year ended december  employee separation benefits fourth quarter  third quarter  second quarter fourth quarter  first quarter  other restructuring costs   total restructuring charges   during  a reversal of previously recognized expense of million was recognized due to changes in estimates of employee separation costs previously recorded 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded total restructuring charges in the amount of million  of which million related to the departure of our former chief operating officer and principal executive officer  ralph del campo  for severance payments and benefits payable under the terms of his severance agreement then in effect 
additionally  there were several research and development positions identified for elimination resulting in a charge of approximately million for separation benefits 
future cash payments related to restructuring activities are estimated to be approximately million in during the third quarter of  the company incurred restructuring charges of million for employee separation benefits as a result of a reduction in force and million for lease termination costs associated with the first and third floors of the company s former bridgewater  new jersey headquarters facility 
during the second quarter of  the company recorded a restructuring charge of million related to the departure of the company s executive vice president  human resources and administration pursuant to the terms of the severance and release agreement 
during the first quarter of  the company incurred restructuring charges of million related to lease termination costs for the former bridgewater  new jersey headquarters facility 
during the third quarter of  we announced a plan to reduce our workforce and operating costs to more closely align our resources and capital with our then on going research and development activities 
this reduction in force reduced the number of employees by approximately percent 
separation payments were made for up to a year following the respective separations 
in connection with this restructuring  we recorded a charge of approximately million for separation benefits 
also during the third quarter of  we recorded a restructuring charge in the amount of million to terminate an operating lease related to the third and first floors of our former bridgewater  new jersey headquarters facility 
during the second quarter of  we recorded a restructuring charge in the amount of million related to the departure of our executive vice president  human resources administration for severance payments and benefits that are payable under the terms of the severance and release agreement 
during the first quarter of  we recorded a restructuring charge in the amount of million related to the excess of committed lease costs over potential sublease income for office space in bridgewater  new jersey that was vacated during the quarter when the company relocated its corporate headquarters to piscataway  new jersey 
the fourth quarter restructuring program was part of our continued efforts to streamline corporate administrative operations and affected approximately employees 
the majority of the terminations occurred during the first quarter of  and separation payments were made for up to a year following the respective separations 
in connection with this restructuring  the company recorded a charge of approximately million for separation benefits 
during the second quarter of  we wrote off certain leasehold improvements and furnishings located at our former headquarters facility in bridgewater  new jersey that were determined to be excess and without future value as a result of the termination and relocation of several employees 
the noncash charge related to this write off was approximately million 
during the third quarter of  we entered into a sublease for a portion of our excess corporate facilities 
these facilities became unused as a result of the reductions in workforce stemming from earlier restructuring efforts 
the charge of approximately million represents the excess of our contractual lease commitment over the amount of cash to be received from the subtenant over the life of the sublease arrangement during the first quarter of  we recorded restructuring charges of million  of which million was for separation benefits resulting from a workforce reduction involving employees 
these actions related primarily to the sale of our former specialty pharmaceutical business  including several employees who were previously engaged in activities related to the divested business but who did not transfer to the employment of the purchaser 
these employees were provided with separation benefits after certain transition periods during which they assisted with an orderly transfer of activities and information to the purchaser 
we also reassessed our staffing requirements subsequent to the sale of our former specialty pharmaceutical business in light of the lessened demands on many of our general and administrative functions 
additionally  our former president and chief executive officer resigned from the company effective february   resulting in million of expenses for severance payments and benefits that were payable per the terms of the individual s employment agreement 
other income expense in millions of dollars year ended december  change change other income expense investment income  net interest expense other than temporary investment impairment loss nm nm other  net total other income expense nm not meaningful net other expense for the three years ended december   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
the repurchase and conversion of a portion of our convertible notes during the three year period affected the year to year comparisons in a number of ways see liquidity and capital resources below 
also  in  two significant items that tended to offset one another were the recognition of an impairment in an investment holding and recognition of an award of a government grant 
further discussion of each of the individual items follows 
net investment income in was million  which represents an increase of versus net investment income in during  we sold long term marketable securities in our portfolio and realized million of gains 
net investment income in was million  which represents a decline of versus million in net investment income earned in for the first three quarters of and for all of  as debt securities matured in our portfolio the proceeds were held in money market funds as opposed to being reinvested in additional debt securities 
the maturing higher yielding securities were purchased several years earlier when prevailing interest rates were higher for all classes of debt holdings 
as they matured  the proceeds were reinvested in lower yielding money market funds in a historically low interest rate environment 
during the fourth quarter of  we resumed investing excess cash in a portfolio of marketable debt securities  although at much lower rates than the previous portfolio was earning 
interest expense includes amortization of deferred debt issuance cost and when debt is repurchased  the write off of deferred debt issuance costs 
interest expense has continued to decline over the three year period through  from million in to million in to million in  due primarily to the conversion in the first quarter of of million principal amount of our convertible notes into shares of our common stock in connection with the sale of our former specialty pharmaceutical business 
in the fourth quarter of  we retired million in principal amount of our convertible notes at par 
the write off of deferred debt issuance costs was approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  the loss on early retirement of notes payable was  in  we retired million in principal amount of our outstanding convertible notes  million of which was retired in the first quarter of and million of which was retired in the second quarter of other than temporary impairment losses on available for sale investment holdings representing credit losses are charged to earnings 
we hold an investment in one auction rate security that we believe is more likely than not impaired due to the lack of credit worthiness of the issuer and its parent company 
consequently  the remaining carrying value of million was written off during the third quarter of other income in and was not material to our results of operations 
other income in is primarily the receipt of a million federal government grant for qualifying therapeutic discovery investments made by us in and discontinued operations the cash proceeds received from the sale of our former specialty pharmaceutical business  including a second quarter working capital adjustment  amounted to approximately million 
of this amount  million was allocated to the sale of in process research and development and included in continuing operations 
the net proceeds then attributable to discontinued operations yielded a gain of million 
the results of operations of our former specialty pharmaceutical business for the period in january preceding the sale amounted to income of million comprising the remainder of the reported in as income and gain from discontinued operations 
although the sale was a taxable event  no tax liability arose due to the basis we had in the underlying assets and the net operating loss 
under the terms of the asset purchase agreement  we also were entitled to receive up to an additional million in milestone payments if certain conditions are met 
of this amount  we earned and received a million milestone payment in the first quarter of  and another million is no longer considered likely to be received 
there can be no assurance that we will receive any of the remaining million in milestone payments 
in addition  we may receive royalties of to percent on incremental net sales above a baseline amount of our former four marketed specialty pharmaceutical products through revenue from these milestones and or royalties is reflected as part of our continuing operations 
income taxes income tax expense in was primarily comprised of a state income tax benefit of million related to the sale of new jersey net operating losses and research and development credits 
no federal income tax expense  other than  in alternative minimum tax  was incurred in relation to normal operating results due to the utilization of net operating losses to offset taxes that would otherwise accrue to operating income 
income tax expense in was primarily comprised of foreign withholding taxes on repatriated funds 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million as of december  and million as of december  the decrease of million was primarily attributable to million used to pay the december special cash dividend  million  inclusive of transaction costs  used to repurchase shares of common stock during and million used to retire million in principal amount of our outstanding convertible notes during cash provided by used in operating activities of our continuing operations represents income loss from continuing operations as adjusted for certain non cash items including depreciation  amortization  impairment and stock based compensation expense and the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities 
cash provided by operating activities of our continuing operations during was million  as compared to cash used in operating activities of million in the increase was due to reduction of loss from continuing operations from million in to million in and increase in net charges related to non cash items from million in to million in  partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities 
cash provided by investing activities amounted to million in as compared to cash used in investing activities in which amounted to million 
we sold marketable debt securities in with a view toward shortening the duration of our portfolio  whereas we used cash proceeds generated from the sale of our former specialty pharmaceutical business in to purchase marketable debt securities in cash used in financing activities in amounted to million with the most significant uses being the use of million to pay the special cash dividend in december and the repurchase of our outstanding common stock which amounted to million representing million shares repurchased 
the purchases were made pursuant to a million share repurchase plan announced in december and  prior to that  a million share repurchase plan announced in december and completed in the fourth quarter of during the third quarter of  we decided to suspend the current million share repurchase program 
during the first quarter of  we announced our intention to resume repurchasing shares of outstanding common stock under this program 
during  we retired million in principal amount of our outstanding convertible notes at a price above par 
in light of our sale review process  we have suspended repurchases under the share repurchase program and do not currently intend to resume repurchases under the share repurchase program 
as of december   the principal amount of our convertible notes outstanding was million 
after giving effect to a required adjustment to the conversion price of our convertible notes resulting from the december special cash dividend  our convertible notes are currently convertible at the option of the holder into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
at december   the potential dilutive effect of conversion of the convertible notes was million shares using the conversion price of per share or shares per  principal amount of notes 
our current sources of liquidity are i our cash  ii our cash equivalents  iii our marketable securities  iv interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and v royalties primarily royalties related to sales of pegintron 
in january  we earned and received a million milestone payment in connection with the sale of our former specialty pharmaceutical business 
no further milestone payments related to the sale of our former specialty pharmaceutical business are expected in  and there can be no assurance that any of these milestone payments will be received in the future 
based upon  our current sources of liquidity  we anticipate our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our capital and operational requirements for the near future 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow limited purposes 
as of december   we were not involved in any off balance sheet special purpose entity transactions 
contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment 
the following chart represents our contractual cash obligations as of december  in millions payments due by period contractual obligations and commercial commitments total less than year years years more than years notes payable due june  operating lease obligations 
interest due on notes payable totals does not include lease revenues to be received pursuant to certain subleased facilities 
as of december   we had million of convertible senior unsecured notes outstanding 
these notes mature on june  unless earlier redeemed  repurchased or converted 
the convertible notes rank equal to all future senior unsecured debt 
if the closing price of our common stock for at least trading days in the consecutive trading day period ending on the date one day prior to the date of a notice of redemption is greater than percent of the applicable conversion price on the date of such notice  we  at our option  may redeem the convertible notes in whole or in part  at a redemption price in cash equal to percent of the principal amount of the convertible notes to be redeemed  plus accrued interest  if any  to the redemption date 
we currently lease a facility in new jersey 
as of december   we had two leased facilities in new jersey 
future minimum lease payments and commitments for operating leases totaled million at december  the lease for our former bridgewater  new jersey facility  which had been subleased to a third party  expired on january  the lease for our former south plainfield  new jersey facility  which had been subleased to a third party  expired on october  our only remaining lease is for our piscataway  new jersey facility  which is currently scheduled to expire on july  in july  we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with santaris pursuant to which we obtained exclusive rights worldwide  other than in europe  to develop and commercialize rna antagonists directed against the hif l  survivin and ar gene targets  as well as rna antagonists directed against six additional gene targets selected by us 
this agreement provides for up to an additional million in milestone payments from us upon the successful completion of certain compound synthesis and selection  clinical development and regulatory milestones 
santaris also is eligible to receive royalties from any future product sales of products based on the licensed antagonists 
santaris retains the right to develop and commercialize products developed under the collaboration in europe 
this agreement provides that any one of the compounds licensed by us from santaris could be returned to santaris if the findings of our preclinical or clinical work do not support our continued investment 
we returned three of the targets to santaris during and one target to santaris during critical accounting policies and estimates a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the us all applicable us gaap accounting standards effective as of december  have been taken into consideration in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
some of those estimates are subjective and complex  and  consequently  actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following accounting policies and estimates have been highlighted as significant because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates  to the extent possible  on historical experience 
historical information is modified as appropriate based on current business factors and various assumptions that we believe are necessary to form a basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes when necessary 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
revenues royalties under our license agreements with third parties and pursuant to the sale of our former specialty pharmaceutical business are recognized when reasonably determinable and earned through the sale of the product by the third party and collection is reasonably assured 
notification from the third party licensee of the royalties earned under the license agreement is the basis for royalty revenue recognition 
this information generally is received from the licensees in the quarter subsequent to the period in which the sales occur 
contingent payments due under the asset purchase agreement related to the sale of our former specialty pharmaceutical business are recognized as income when the milestone has been achieved and collection is assured 
such payments are non refundable  and no further effort is required on the part of the company or the other party to complete the earning process 
non refundable payments received upon entering into license and other collaborative agreements where we have continuing involvement are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the estimated service period 
the sale of our former specialty pharmaceutical business involved the application of guidance regarding multiple deliverables in separating the revenues associated with the sale of in process research and development from the other elements of the transaction  namely the assets sold as part of discontinued operations and our continuing involvement in contract research activities 
we determined that the in process research and development had value to the buyer of our former specialty pharmaceutical business on a stand alone basis and that there was objective and reliable evidence available to support the allocation of the total purchase price to the respective units of accounting 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost reduced for any impairment charges  net of accumulated depreciation 
depreciation of fixed assets is provided by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
when assets are retired or otherwise disposed of  the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts  and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in operations for the period 
amortization of leasehold improvements is calculated using the straight line method over the remaining term of the lease or the life of the asset  whichever is shorter 
the costs of repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred while significant improvements are capitalized 
property and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if circumstances require a property and equipment or asset group be tested for possible impairment  we first compare undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that property and equipment or asset group to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the property and equipment or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis  an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models  quoted market values and third party independent appraisals  as considered necessary 
research and development expenses we accrue expenses for the cost of work performed by contract research organizations  contract manufacturing organizations and others based upon the estimated amount of the total effort completed on each order  study or project using factors such as the number of lots produced  the number of patients enrolled  the number of active clinical sites and the duration for which the patients are enrolled in the study 
we base the estimates on the information available at the time 
additional information may become available at a later date that would enable us to develop a more accurate estimate 
such changes in estimate are generally recognized in the period when the information is first known 
income taxes under the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets is provided for when it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as of december   we believe  based on our projections  that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets  including our net operating losses from operating activities and stock option exercises  will not be realized 
we recognize the benefit of an uncertain tax position that we have taken or expect to take on the income tax returns we file if it is more likely than not we will be able to sustain our position 
stock based compensation compensation cost  measured by the fair value of the equity instruments issued  adjusted for estimated forfeitures  is recognized in the financial statements as the respective awards are earned 
the impact that stock based compensation awards will have on our results of operations is a function of the number of shares awarded  vesting and the trading price and fair value of our stock at the date of grant or modification 
fair value of stock based compensation is determined using the black scholes valuation model  which employs weighted average assumptions for the expected volatility of our stock  the expected term until exercise of the options  the risk free interest rate  and dividends  if any 
expected volatility is based on our historical stock price information
