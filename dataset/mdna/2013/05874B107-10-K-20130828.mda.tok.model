we review certain financial measures in assessing our financial condition and operating performance not only in connection with creating our internal forecasts and in making comparisons to financial results from prior periods  but also in making comparisons to our competitors financial results

table of contents comprehensive list of all factors considered by us in assessing our financial condition and operating performance  and we may consider other individual measures as required by trends and discrete events arising in a specific period  but they are the key indicators 
the gaming sector was negatively impacted by the recent prolonged reduction in consumer spending and limited resources available to fund capital projects 
while consumer spending on gaming activities has increased within the last twelve months as a result of this prolonged economic environment we provided select customers a greater amount of payment terms for periods up to one year  and in some cases for periods up to three years 
we expect to continue to extend credit for these longer periods for the foreseeable future 
there are several new and potential gaming market developments that we believe will benefit us in the long term 
in our domestic market  we are focused on approved new jurisdictional opportunities and expansions in illinois  ohio  maryland  louisiana  mississippi  massachusetts  new york and california  and the potential for new market opportunities in new hampshire  kentucky and texas 
the breadth and timing of such opportunities remain uncertain due to the legislative process in these jurisdictions  as well as the difficult credit environment facing certain of our customers and the risk of the gaming industry impact of renewed economic uncertainty 
we are also engaged in expanding our position in south africa  australia  new zealand  the philippines and mexico  and into potential new markets in eastern europe  greece  taiwan  south korea  japan  and brazil 
our entry into the italian vlt market in july was delayed by a lengthened regulatory approval process that developed in that market after we submitted our products for approval

the items have value on a standalone basis if they are sold separately by any vendor or the customer could resell the delivered items on a standalone basis  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items  delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of us 
considerable judgment is required to determine whether an arrangement consists of multiple deliverables  whether each delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis and in determining the relative selling price used to allocate the arrangement fee to each deliverable 
such determination affects the amount and timing of revenue recognition 
management evaluates the primary use and functionality of each deliverable in determining whether a delivered item has stand 
table of contents alone value and qualifies as a separate unit of accounting 
judgments for revenue recognition also involve an assessment as to whether collectability is reasonably assured and whether fees under an arrangement are fixed or determinable 
at the inception of a multiple element arrangement  fees under the arrangement are allocated to the nonsoftware deliverables  and to the software deliverables as a group based on their relative selling price 
software deliverables are further subject to separation and allocation based on software revenue recognition guidance as described in the following paragraph 
when applying the relative selling price method  a hierarchy is used for estimating the selling price based first on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  then third party evidence tpe and finally management estimate of the selling price esp 
revenue for each unit of accounting is recognized when the relevant recognition criteria for each respective element has been met 
in allocating arrangement fees under the relative selling price hierarchy  we use vsoe for all products which have been sold on a stand alone basis or the stated renewal rate for maintenance and product support fees 
as tpe is generally not available  we use esp for products that are not sold on a stand alone basis and for recently introduced products that are sold on a stand alone basis but for which a history of stand alone sales has not yet been developed 
following these guidelines  we use either vsoe or esp for gaming devices  system based hardware products  maintenance and product support fees associated with perpetual licenses and professional services  and esp for perpetual and time based software licenses and maintenance and product support fees associated with time based licenses 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue allocated to software deliverables 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered element and is recognized as revenue 
in arrangements in which we do not have vsoe of fair value of all undelivered software elements  revenue is deferred until delivery occurs or vsoe of fair value has been established for any remaining undelivered software elements 
in the event the only undelivered software element is maintenance and product support for which vsoe of fair value does not exist  the revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance and product support period 
the establishment of vsoe requires judgment as to whether there is a sufficient quantity of items sold on a stand alone basis and whether the prices demonstrate an appropriate level of concentration to conclude that vsoe exists 
in determining esp  management considers a variety of information including historic pricing and discounting practices  competitive market activity  internal costs  and the pricing and discounting practices of products sold in bundled arrangements 
allowances for doubtful accounts we regularly evaluate the credit quality of our accounts and notes receivable and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors including  but not limited to  customer collection experience  economic conditions  and the customer financial condition 
in addition to specific account identification  which includes the review of any modifications of accounts and notes receivable  if applicable  we utilize historic collection experience for the most recent twelve month period to establish an allowance for doubtful accounts 
receivables are written off only after we have exhausted all collection efforts 
during the years ended june   and  the provision for doubtful accounts was million  million and million  respectively 
inventories we regularly review inventory quantities and update estimates for the net realizable value of inventories to estimate potentially excess or obsolete inventory 
our process includes examining the 
table of contents carrying values of new and used gaming devices  parts and ancillary equipment in comparison to the current fair market values for such equipment less costs to sell or dispose 
the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons  generally one year or less 
additional factors involved in this analysis include the overall levels of our inventories  the costs required to sell the products  including refurbishment costs and importation costs for international shipments  and the overall projected demand for products once the next generation of products are scheduled for release 
demand for parts inventory is also subject to technical obsolescence 
as a result of our ongoing analysis of inventory  we recognized inventory write downs totaling million  million and million during the years ended june   and  respectively 
additional valuation charges could occur in the future as a result of changes in the factors listed above 
leased gaming equipment leased gaming equipment is stated at cost and depreciated over estimated useful lives ranging from one to three and one half years 
the estimation of useful lives for our leased gaming equipment requires judgment and is based on the period of time over which we believe the assets will be of economic benefit 
given changes in technology  customer preferences and product demand  we review and evaluate the recoverability of our investment in such assets on a quarterly basis  as well as the estimated useful lives used to depreciate these assets 
there is the potential for acceleration of future depreciation  or asset impairments  if conditions were to change and certain factors were determined to have an adverse impact on our ability to realize our full investment in such assets 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill we review long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived assets are measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future  net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset  undiscounted and without interest 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
we review goodwill for impairment annually at the beginning of our fourth fiscal quarter  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable or warrant a revision to the estimated remaining useful life 
we perform the impairment analysis of goodwill at a reporting unit level by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with our carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
we are required to make significant judgments and estimates regarding future cash flows  the determination of fair values and the identification of reporting units utilized in determining the fair value and recoverability of long lived assets and goodwill 
we believe our estimates are reasonable  however  if our estimates materially differ or factors utilized in developing our estimates change  different assumptions could materially affect our assessment of the fair value and recoverability of long lived assets and goodwill 
during the years ended june   and  no impairment charges related to long lived assets or goodwill were recorded 

table of contents share based compensation we account for share based compensation based on the calculated fair value of the award measured on the grant date which is recognized  net of estimated forfeitures  as expense over the employee requisite service period which is generally the vesting period of the equity grant 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected option term and the expected volatility of our common stock over the option expected term 
we believe that the valuation technique and the approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions are appropriate in calculating the fair values of stock options granted  however  if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  share based compensation expense could be materially impacted 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate  and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
pre tax share based compensation expense from continuing operations was million  million and million during the years ended june   and  respectively 
as of june   there was million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of stock options which will be recognized over the subsequent years 
in addition  as of june   there was million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of restricted stock  restricted stock units rsus and performance stock units psus which will be recognized over the subsequent years 
income taxes we conduct business globally and are subject to income taxes in us federal  state  local  and foreign jurisdictions 
determination of the appropriate amount and classification of income taxes depends on several factors  including estimates of the timing and probability of realization of deferred income taxes  reserves for uncertain income tax positions and income tax payment timing 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 
taxes on income of our foreign subsidiaries are provided at the tax rates applicable to the tax jurisdictions in which they are located 
we have not provided income taxes on approximately million and million of undistributed earnings as of june  and  respectively  from certain foreign subsidiaries 
we plan to permanently invest the earnings in the foreign subsidiaries and therefore have not recorded a deferred tax liability associated with the undistributed earnings 
a determination of the potential deferred tax liability which would result from these earnings is not practicable at this time 
the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets is based in part on estimates of future income and the timing of temporary differences  and the failure to fully realize such deferred tax assets could result in a higher tax provision in future periods 
our net deferred tax assets from continuing operations totaled million and million at june  and  respectively 
our accrued income taxes payable totaled million and million and our accrued income taxes receivable totaled million and million at june  and  respectively 
we have classified million 
table of contents of the accrued income taxes receivable at june  as long term as we do not expect collection of these amounts in the next twelve months 
we apply financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic accounting for uncertainty in income taxes to our uncertain tax positions 
under the guidance  we may recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain position only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the issue 
the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that we believe has greater than a likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
we are required to make significant judgments when evaluating our uncertain tax positions and the related tax benefits 
we believe our assumptions are reasonable  however  there is no guarantee that the final outcome of the related matters will not differ from the amounts reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals 
we adjust our liability for uncertain tax positions based on changes in facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or changes in estimates 
our income tax provision may be impacted to the extent that the final outcome of these tax positions is different than the amounts recorded 
as of june  and  our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits totaled million and million  respectively 
of these amounts  million and million  respectively  if recognized  would impact the effective tax rate

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of june   we had total debt outstanding of approximately million which consisted primarily of a million term loan and million of borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
during the year  the interest rate for the credit facility was subject to a leveraged based pricing grid 
we have minimized our exposure to market interest rate risk because the variable interest rate on the term loan was effectively converted to a fixed rate as a result of the floating to fixed interest rate swaps entered into in december and june  respectively  and discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  long term debt 
as of june   the interest rate on the revolving credit facility was and the interest rate on our term loan was approximately  after giving effect to our remaining interest rate swaps  given our leverage ratio was approximately for the period 
we estimate a hypothetical decline of bps in applicable interest rates would have an immaterial impact on our business because we manage this exposure with derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency exchange rate risk certain of our foreign subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency and are exposed to risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
during the years ended june  and  we recognized foreign currency exchange rate losses of approximately million and million  respectively  and during the year ended june   we recognized a foreign currency exchange rate gain of approximately million 
we estimate that a hypothetical strengthening 
table of contents or weakening of the us dollar for fiscal year would have had an immaterial impact on our business 
in addition  the net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency translation gains and losses which are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity in our consolidated balance sheet 
such translation resulted in an unrealized loss of million for fiscal year and an unrealized gain of  for fiscal year we may enter into foreign currency forward contracts  generally with maturities of twelve months or less  to hedge recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities to reduce the reduce the risk that earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates
