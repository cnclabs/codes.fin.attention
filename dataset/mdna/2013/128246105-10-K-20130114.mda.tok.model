item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including  but not limited to  those presented under risks related to our business included in item a and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a leader in the distribution of avocados  prepared avocado products  and other perishable food products throughout the united states 
our expertise in marketing and distributing avocados  prepared avocados  and other perishable foods allows us to deliver a wide array of fresh and prepared food products to food distributors  produce wholesalers  supermarkets  and restaurants on a worldwide basis 
we procure avocados principally from california  mexico  and chile 
through our various operating facilities  we sort  pack  and or ripen avocados  tomatoes and or hawaiian grown papayas 
additionally  we also produce salsa and prepare ready to eat produce and deli products 
during the second quarter of  we increased the number of our reportable segments and our chief executive officer now reviews our business as having three reportable segments 
renaissance food group  llc rfg  which was previously included in our calavo foods segment  has now been separated as a segment of its own 
the change in segments was made as rfg ceased having similar economic characteristics to products included in our calavo foods segment 
accordingly  we now have three reportable operating segments  fresh products  calavo foods  and rfg 
segment results of the prior period have been reclassified to reflect these changes 
our fresh products business grades  sizes  packs  cools  and ripens if desired avocados for delivery to our customers 
we presently operate two packinghouses and three operating and distributing facilities that handle avocados across the united states 
these packinghouses handled approximately of the california avocado crop during the fiscal year  based on data obtained from the california avocado commission 
our operating results and the returns we pay our growers are highly dependent on the volume of avocados delivered to our packinghouses  as a significant portion of our costs is fixed 
our strategy calls for continued efforts to retain and recruit growers that meet our business model 
additionally  our fresh products business also procures avocados grown in chile and mexico  as well as other various commodities  including tomatoes  papayas  and pineapples 
we operate a packinghouse in mexico that  together with certain co packers that we frequently purchase fruit from  handled approximately of the mexican avocado crop bound for the united states market and approximately of the avocados exported from mexico to countries other than the united states during the mexican season  based on our estimates 
additionally  during the chilean avocado season  we handled approximately of the chilean avocado crop  based on our estimates 
our strategy is to increase our market share of currently sourced avocados to all accepted marketplaces 
we believe our diversified avocado sources provides a level of supply stability that may  over time  help solidify the demand for avocados among consumers in the united states and elsewhere in the world 
we believe our efforts in distributing our other various commodities  such as those shown above  complement our offerings of avocados 
from time to time  we continue to explore distribution of other crops that provide reasonable returns to the business 
our calavo foods business procures avocados  processes avocados into a wide variety of guacamole products  and distributes the processed product to our customers 
all of our prepared avocado products shipped to north america are now cold pasteurized and include both frozen and fresh guacamole 
due to the long shelf life of our frozen guacamole and the purity of our fresh guacamole  we believe that we are well positioned to address the diverse taste and needs of today s customers 
additionally  we also prepare various fresh salsa products 
customers include both food service industry and retail businesses 
we continue to seek to expand our relationships with major food service companies and develop alliances that will allow our products to reach a larger percentage of the marketplace 
net sales of frozen products represented approximately and of total processed segment sales for the years ended october  and net sales of our ultra high pressure products represented approximately and of total processed segment sales for the years ended october  and our rfg business produces  markets and distributes nationally a portfolio of healthy  high quality lifestyle products for consumers via the retail channel 
rfg products range from fresh cut fruit  ready to eat vegetables  recipe ready vegetables and deli meat products 
rfg sells under the popular labels of garden highway fresh cut  garden highway  and garden highway chef essentials to a wide range of customers 
the operating results of all of our businesses have been  and will continue to be  affected by quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns due to a number of factors  such as pests and disease  weather patterns  changes in demand by consumers  the timing of the receipt  reduction  or cancellation of significant customer orders  the gain or loss of significant customers  market acceptance of our products  our ability to develop  introduce  and market new products on a timely basis  availability and cost of avocados and supplies from growers and vendors  new product introductions by our competitors  change in the mix of avocados and calavo foods we sell  and general economic conditions 
we believe  however  that we are currently positioned to address these risks and deliver favorable operating results for the foreseeable future 
recent developments dividend payment on december   we paid a per share dividend in the aggregate amount of million to shareholders of record on november  contingencies hacienda suits during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we won our appeal related to the examination of the tax year ended december  we believe this examination is now completed  resulting in no impact on our financial statements 
as previously disclosed  during the third quarter of fiscal year  we received an update from our outside legal counsel regarding the hacienda s examination of the tax year ended december  the appellate court  via a second resolution  upheld the lower court s decision on two outstanding tax assessments from the hacienda for which we had previously received unfavorable rulings 
management  as well as our outside legal counsel  still believes the company s position was correct 
based on discussions with our outside legal counsel in mexico  we did not believe we would be able to appeal this decision any further ie to the mexican supreme court and  as a result  were forced to pay an assessment 
the total net assessment related to these allegations was approximately million  which we recorded as income tax expense for the year ended october  the payment related to this tax assessment was paid during our third fiscal quarter 
sale of investment in maui fresh international  llc maui on october   calavo entered into a sale of llc interest agreement sale agreement with san rafael  pursuant to which the company agreed to sell to san rafael all of our interest  representing one half ownership  in maui for million 
this transaction resulted in a gain on sale of approximately million 
since  calavo and san rafael both had a interest in the joint venture of maui for the purpose of the marketing  sale and distribution of fresh produce from the los angeles wholesale produce market 
pursuant to the sale agreement  san rafael made an initial down payment of million on october  concurrently  san rafeal also entered into two promissory notes  the equity promissory note and the goodwill promissory note 
the equity promissory note of million and the goodwill promissory note of million have been secured by a pledge by san rafael s entire ownership interest on maui and were guaranteed by francisco clouthier owner of san rafael 
the equity promissory note  totaling approximately million  will be paid in equal monthly principal payments plus accrued interest  as defined  on the unpaid principal balance 
the entire amount of principal and all accrued unpaid interest shall be due and payable on november  the goodwill promissory note  totaling million  is due and payable in full on november  critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate all of our estimates  including those related to the areas of customer and grower receivables  inventories  useful lives of property  plant and equipment  promotional allowances  income taxes  retirement benefits  and commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions as additional information becomes available in future periods 
management has discussed the development and selection of critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting estimates in this annual report 
we believe the following are the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
promotional allowances 
we provide for promotional allowances at the time of sale  based on our historical experience 
our estimates are generally based on evaluating the relationship between promotional allowances and gross sales 
the derived percentage is then applied to the current period s sales revenues in order to arrive at the appropriate debit to sales allowances for the period 
the offsetting credit is made to accrued liabilities 
when certain amounts of specific customer accounts are subsequently identified as promotional  they are written off against this allowance 
actual amounts may differ from these estimates and such differences are recognized as an adjustment to net sales in the period they are identified 
a change in the derived percentage for the entire year would impact results of operations by approximately million 
income taxes 
we account for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
measurement of the deferred items is based on enacted tax laws 
in the event the future consequences of differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of our assets and liabilities result in a deferred tax asset  we perform an evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by such asset 
a valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions  and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions 
if we ultimately determine that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary  the liability will be reversed and we will recognize a tax benefit during the period in which it is determined the liability no longer applies 
conversely  we record additional tax charges in a period in which it is determined that a recorded tax liability is less than the ultimate assessment is expected to be 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from management s estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
goodwill  defined as unidentified asset s acquired in conjunction with a business acquisition  is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below the operating segment 
goodwill impairment testing is a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  and the second step of the impairment test would be unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
goodwill impairment testing requires significant judgment and management estimates  including  but not limited to  the determination of i the number of reporting units  ii the goodwill and other assets and liabilities to be allocated to the reporting units and iii the fair values of the reporting units 
the estimates and assumptions described above  along with other factors such as discount rates  will significantly affect the outcome of the impairment tests and the amounts of any resulting impairment losses 
we performed our annual assessment of goodwill and determined that an impairment million existed related to the acquisition of csl 
this impairment was a result of less than anticipated sales since acquisition  and a forecast projection analysis with the consultation from a third party consulting firm 
the impairment was recorded in cost of goods sold 
no other impairments were noted as of october  contingent consideration 
each period  we revalue our contingent consideration obligations to their fair value and record increases or decreases in the fair value into selling  general and administrative expense 
increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can result from changes in the assumed timing and amount of revenue and expense estimates  changes in the probability of payment scenarios  as well as changes in capital market conditions  which impact the discount rate used in the fair valuation 
significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period 
accordingly  future business and economic conditions  as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above  can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period 
total net increase to the contingent considerations in fiscal year totaled million 
total net decrease to the contingent considerations in fiscal year totaled million 
allowance for accounts receivable 
we provide an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable balances based on historical experience and the aging of the related accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of income  expressed as percentages of our total net sales  for the periods indicated year ended october  net sales gross margins selling  general and administrative operating income interest income interest expense other income  net net income net sales we believe that the fundamentals for our products continue to be favorable 
firstly  americans are eating more avocados 
united states us avocado demand continues to grow  with per capita use at nearly pounds per person  on average  over the past three years  percent higher than the average and more than double the average during the s 
we believe that the healthy eating trend that has been developing in the united states contributes to such growth  as avocados  which are cholesterol and sodium free  are dense in fiber  vitamin b  antioxidants  potassium  folate  and contain unsaturated fat  which help lower cholesterol 
also  a growing number of research studies seem to suggest that phytonutrients  which avocados are rich in  help fight chronic illnesses  such as heart disease and cancer 
additionally  we believe that the demographic changes in the us will greatly impact the consumption of avocados and avocado based products 
the hispanic community currently accounts for approximately of the us population  and the total number of hispanics is estimated to triple by the year avocados are considered a staple item purchased by hispanic consumers  as the per capita avocado consumption in mexico is considered significantly higher than that of the us we anticipate avocado products will further penetrate the united states marketplace driven by year round availability of fresh avocados due to imports  a rapid growing hispanic population  and the promotion of the health benefits of avocados 
as the largest marketer of avocado products in the united states  we believe that we are well positioned to leverage this trend and to grow all segments of our business 
additionally  we also believe that avocados and avocado based products will further penetrate other marketplaces that we currently operate in  as interest in avocados continues to expand 
in october  the usda announced the creation of a hass avocado board to promote the sale of hass variety avocados in the us marketplace 
this board provides a basis for a unified funding of promotional activities based on an assessment on all avocados sold in the us marketplace 
the california avocado commission  which receives its funding from california avocado growers  has historically shouldered the promotional and advertising costs supporting avocado sales 
we believe that the incremental funding of promotional and advertising programs in the us will  in the long term  positively impact average selling prices and will favorably impact our avocado businesses 
during fiscal  and  on behalf of avocado growers  we remitted approximately million  million and million to the california avocado commission 
during fiscal  and  we remitted approximately million  million and million to the hass avocado board related to avocados 
additionally  through the acquisition of rfg  we substantially expanded and accelerated the company s presence in the fast growing refrigerated fresh packaged foods category through an array of retail product lines for produce  deli  meat and food service departments 
we also believe that our diversified fresh products  primarily tomatoes  papayas and pineapples  are positioned for future growth and expansion 
the tomato is the fourth most popular fresh market vegetable behind potatoes  lettuce  and onions in the united states 
although stabilizing in the first decade of the s  annual average fresh market tomato consumption remains well above that of the previous decade 
over the past few decades  per capita use of tomatoes has been on the rise due to the enduring popularity of salads  salad bars  and bacon lettuce tomato and submarine sandwiches 
perhaps of greater importance has been the introduction of improved tomato varieties  heightened consumer interest in a wider range of tomatoes  a surge of new immigrants who eat vegetable intensive diets  and expanding national emphasis on health and nutrition 
papayas have become more popular as the consumption in the united states has more than doubled in the past decade 
papayas have high nutritional benefits 
they are rich in anti oxidants  the b vitamins  folate and pantothenic acid  and the minerals  potassium and magnesium  and fiber 
together  these nutrients promote the health of the cardiovascular system and also provide protection against colon cancer 
sales of products and related costs of products sold are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
service revenue  including freight  ripening  storage  bagging and palletization charges  is recorded when services are performed and sales of the related products are delivered 
we provide for sales returns and promotional allowances at the time of shipment  based on our experience

the following table summarizes our net sales by business segment change change dollars in thousands net sales fresh products calavo foods rfg   n a total net sales as a percentage of net sales fresh products calavo foods rfg net sales for the year ended october   compared to  increased by million  or 
the increase in sales  when compared to the same corresponding prior year period  is primarily related to an increase in product sales of the rfg and primarily due to only five months of rfg sales being included in the results based on the timing of the rfg acquisition 
not considering rfg  we experienced a decrease in fresh product sales during fiscal year  which was due primarily to decreased sales of mexican  california and chilean sourced avocados  as well as tomatoes  partially offset by an increase in sales of pineapples 
while the procurement of fresh avocados related to our fresh products segment is very seasonal  our calavo foods business is generally not subject to a seasonal effect 
see detailed explanations below 
net sales to third parties by segment exclude value added services billed by our uruapan packinghouse and our uruapan processing plant to the parent company 
all intercompany sales are eliminated in our consolidated results of operations 
fresh products fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales delivered by the fresh products business decreased by approximately million  or  for the year ended october   when compared to fiscal as discussed above  this decrease in fresh product sales during fiscal year was primarily related to decreased sales of mexican  california and chilean sourced avocados  as well as tomatoes 
these decreases were partially offset  however  by increased sales from pineapples 
see details below 
sales of mexican sourced avocados decreased million  or  primarily for the year ended october   when compared to the same prior year period 
the decrease in mexican sourced avocados was due to a decrease in the sales price per carton  which decreased by approximately  when compared to the same prior year period 
we attribute this decrease primarily to a higher overall volume of avocados in the marketplace 
partially offsetting this decrease  was an increase in pounds sold of million pounds or  when compared to the same prior year period 
mexican grown avocados are primarily sold in the us  japanese  and european marketplace 
sales of california sourced avocados decreased million  or  for the year ended october   when compared to the same prior year period 
the decrease in california sourced avocados was primarily due to a decrease in sales price per carton  which decreased approximately 
partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in pounds sold  which increased approximately million pounds or 
we attribute most of this increase in volume and decrease in per sale price per carton to the larger california avocado crop in  when compared to california avocados are primarily sold in the us marketplace 
sales of tomatoes decreased million  or  for the year ended october   when compared to the same period for fiscal the decrease in sales for tomatoes is primarily due to a decrease in the sales price per carton of  when compared to the same prior year period 
we attribute most of the decrease in the per carton selling price to the higher volume of tomatoes from all sources in the us marketplace 
sales of chilean sourced avocados decreased million  or for the year ended october   when compared to the same prior year period 
the decrease in chilean sourced avocados was primarily due to a decrease in pounds sold 
chilean sourced avocados sales reflect a decrease in million pounds of avocados sold  or  when compared to the same prior year period 
partially offsetting such decreases was an increase in sales of pineapples  which increased million  or  for the year ended october   when compared to the same prior year period 
the increase in sales of pineapples was primarily due to an increase in units sold of  when compared to the same prior year period 
we believe this increase is due to a more consistent reliable source of fresh pineapples and a new offering of crownless pineapples  which has increased our sales volume 
we anticipate that sales of mexican grown avocados will increase in fiscal  when compared to the same prior year period  due to a large mexican avocado crop  partially offset by a decrease overall sales prices 
we anticipate that sales volume of california grown avocados will increase in fiscal  due to a larger expected california avocado crop 
we anticipate sales of chilean avocados to decrease based on the aforementioned large mexican avocado crop 
fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales delivered by the business increased by approximately million  or  from fiscal to this increase in fresh product sales during fiscal was primarily related to an increase in sales of mexican sourced avocados 
this increase was partially offset  however  by decreased sales from tomatoes and california sourced avocados 
see details below 
sales of mexican sourced avocados increased million  or  for the year ended october   when compared to the same prior year period 
the increase in mexican sourced avocados was due to a combination of an increase in pounds sold and an increase in the sales price per carton 
mexican sourced avocados sales reflect an increase in million pounds of avocados sold  or  when compared to the same prior year period 
we attribute most of this increase in volume to the significant decrease in the california avocado crop see below 
in addition  the sales price per carton increased by approximately 
we attribute this increase primarily to a lower overall volume of avocados in the marketplace  as well as a steady to higher demand for avocados when compared to the same prior year period 
partially offsetting the overall increase was a decrease in sales of tomatoes of million  or  for the year ended october   when compared to the same prior year period 
the decrease in sales for tomatoes was primarily due to a decrease in volume by when compared to the same prior year period 
this significant decrease was mainly due to a freeze in mexico that resulted in less units in the marketplace 
in addition  tomatoes had a decrease in the average selling price per carton of approximately  when compared to the same prior year period 
sales of california sourced avocados decreased million  or  for the year ended october   when compared to the same prior year period 
the decrease in california sourced avocados was due to a decrease of million pounds of avocados sold or  when compared to the same prior year period 
we attribute most of this decrease in volume to the smaller california avocado crop in the current year 
partially offsetting this decrease  california sourced avocado sales reflect an increase in the sales price per carton of approximately  when compared to the same prior year period 
we attribute this increase primarily to a lower overall volume of avocados in the marketplace  as well as a higher demand for avocados  when compared to the same prior year period 
calavo foods fiscal vs 
fiscal sales for calavo foods for the year ended october   when compared to the same period for fiscal  increased million  or 
this increase was due primarily to an increase in sales of prepared guacamole products of million or  an increase in sales of salsa  which increased approximately million  or  and an increase of sales of tortilla chips  which increased approximately million  or 
the increase in prepared guacamole products was primarily related to a increase in the average net selling price per pound for our frozen and refrigerated guacamole products formerly high pressure  partially offset by a decrease in overall pounds sold by 
fiscal vs 
fiscal calavo foods sales for the year ended october   when compared to the same period for fiscal  decreased million  or 
this decrease in sales primarily relates to a decrease in pounds sold of our prepared guacamole products  which decreased approximately 
the decrease in pounds sold primarily related to a decrease in the pounds sold of our frozen guacamole products  which decreased approximately  and a decrease in the sale of our refrigerated guacamole products formerly high pressure  see below  which decreased approximately when compared to the same prior year period 
in an effort to enhance product safety and quality in the segment  we implemented changes in our food safety standards that added steps in our manufacturing process during the first quarter of fiscal as a result  there was a temporary disruption  which adversely impacted supply and sales in the segment 
in addition  sales were impacted  as substantially all guacamole products are now high pressured for food safety purposes and that the packaging requested from certain customers does not allow for high pressured products 
this resulted in the discontinuance of sales to some high volume  low margin customers 
the net average selling price increased during the year ended october   when compared to the same prior year period 
this increase is primarily related to a change in sales mix and a price increase that went into effect in july on substantially all products 
rfg sales for rfg for the year ended october   when compared to the same prior year period  increased million  or 
as the acquisition was completed on june   only five months of sales are included in fiscal year gross margins our cost of sales consists predominantly of fruit costs  packing materials  freight and handling  labor and overhead including depreciation associated with preparing food products  and other direct expenses pertaining to products sold 
gross margins increased by approximately million  or  for the year ended october   when compared to the same period for fiscal we achieved higher gross margins at all three of our segments 
the following table summarizes our gross margins and gross profit percentages by business segment change change dollars in thousands gross margins fresh products calavo foods rfg   n a total gross margins gross profit percentages fresh products calavo foods rfg consolidated fresh products fiscal vs 
fiscal during fiscal year  as compared to the same prior year periods  we experienced an overall increase in the fresh products gross margin percentage 
the increase was primarily related to an increase in the gross margin percentage for california and mexican sourced avocados 
the gross margin from california sourced avocados primarily increased due to a significant increase in the volume of california avocados sold for the year ended october   as compared to the same prior year period  which increased 
this increase was primarily related to the larger california avocado crop for  when compared to prior year 
this had the effect of decreasing our fixed per pound costs  which  as a result  positively impacted gross margins 
the gross margin from mexican sourced avocados increased due to lower fruit costs per pound  which decreased by  when compared to the same prior year period 
we believe this decrease was primarily related to the increase in the availability of avocados in the us marketplace  when compared to the same prior year period 
in addition  the us dollar to mexican peso exchange rate strengthened in fiscal year  when compared to the same prior period 
all of these combined had the effect of decreasing our per pound costs related to mexican sourced avocados  which  as a result  positively impacted gross margins 
any significant fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the mexican peso may have a material impact on future gross margins for our fresh segments 
the gross margin and or gross profit percentage for consignment sales  including certain chilean avocados and tomatoes  are dependent on the volume of fruit we handle  the average selling prices  and the competitiveness of the returns that we provide to third party growers packers 
the gross margin we earn is generally based on a commission agreed to with each party  which usually is a percent of the overall selling price 
although we generally do not take legal title to such avocados and perishable products  we do assume responsibilities principally assuming credit risk  inventory loss and delivery risk  and limited pricing risk that are consistent with acting as a principal in the transaction 
accordingly  our results of operations include sales and cost of sales from the sale of avocados and perishable products procured under consignment arrangements 
for fiscal years  we generated gross margins of million from consigned sales 
this is a million decrease in gross margin for consigned sales compared to previous year 
this decrease is due to a decrease in tomato sales of for fiscal  when compared to the same prior year period 
the decrease in sales for tomatoes is primarily due to a decrease in the sales price per carton of  when compared to the same prior year period 
we attribute most of the decrease in the per carton selling price to the higher volume of tomatoes from all sources in the us marketplace 
fiscal vs 
fiscal during fiscal year  as compared to the same prior year period  the decrease in our fresh products segment gross margin percentage was primarily related to higher costs associated with california sourced avocados 
this was caused by fewer pounds being sold by approximately  increasing our per pound costs  which  as a result  negatively impacted gross margins 
this decrease was primarily related to the smaller california avocado crop 
contributing to the decrease in the gross margin percentage was higher mexican sourced avocado fruit costs year over year by approximately 
we were able to increase the selling prices of mexican sourced avocados  but not at the same rate at which fruit costs increased 
we attribute this increase primarily to a lower overall volume of avocados in the marketplace  in conjunction with a steady to higher demand for avocados  when compared to the same prior year period 
the combined effect of these negatively impacted gross margins 
in addition  despite the recent strengthening of the us dollar to mexican peso exchange rate  on a year to date basis  the us dollar to mexican peso exchange rate weakened during fiscal  when compared to the same prior period 
all of these combined had the effect of increasing our per pound costs  which  as a result  negatively impacted gross margins 
the gross margin and or gross profit percentage for consignment sales  including certain chilean avocados and tomatoes  are dependent on the volume of fruit we handle  the average selling prices  and the competitiveness of the returns that we provide to third party growers packers 
the gross margin we earn is generally based on a commission agreed to with each party  which usually is a percent of the overall selling price 
although we generally do not take legal title to such avocados and perishable products  we do assume responsibilities principally assuming credit risk  inventory loss and delivery risk  and limited pricing risk that are consistent with acting as a principal in the transaction 
accordingly  our results of operations include sales and cost of sales from the sale of avocados and perishable products procured under consignment arrangements 
for fiscal years  we generated gross margins of million from the sale of fresh produce products that were packed by third parties 
this is a million decrease in gross margin for consigned sales compared to previous year 
this decrease is due to a decrease in tomato sales of for fiscal  when compared to the same prior year period 
the decrease in sales for tomatoes was primarily due to a decrease in volume by when compared to the same prior year period 
this significant decrease was mainly due to a freeze in mexico that resulted in less units 
in addition  tomatoes had a decrease in the average selling price per carton of approximately  when compared to the same prior year period 
calavo foods fiscal vs 
fiscal gross profit percentages for calavo foods for the year ended october   as compared to the same prior year period  increased primarily as a result of lower fruit and operating costs  partially offset by a decrease in total pounds sold 
fruit costs for the year ended october   decreased  when compared to the same prior year period 
these decreases in fruit costs are primarily due to the increase in the availability of avocados in the us marketplace  when compared to same prior year period 
in addition  the strengthening of the us dollar compared to the mexican peso  year over year  decreased our per pound costs 
all of these combined had the effect of decreasing our per pound costs  which  as a result  positively impacted gross margins 
we anticipate that the gross margin percentage for our calavo foods segment will continue to experience significant fluctuations during this fiscal year primarily due to the uncertainty of the cost of fruit that will be used in the production process 
in addition  any significant fluctuation in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the mexican peso may have a material impact on future gross margins for our calavo foods segment 
fiscal vs 
fiscal gross profit percentages for calavo foods for the year ended october   as compared to the same prior year period  decreased primarily as a result of significantly higher fruit costs 
fruit costs increased for the year ended october   when compared to the same prior year period 
we attribute this increase primarily to a lower overall volume of avocados in the marketplace  in conjunction with a steady to higher demand for avocados  when compared to the same prior year period 
as discussed above  material fluctuations in fruit costs can have a significant impact on gross margins in the calavo foods segment 
the increase in our production costs was primarily related to the aforementioned change see net sales discussion in the food safety standards that added steps in our manufacturing process during the first quarter of fiscal in addition  in the fourth quarter of  our l ultra high pressure machine experienced a mechanical failure 
this restricted the amount of product that could be produced  which lowered our overall volume and increasing our production costs 
we replaced this machine in the first quarter of  and believe our operating capacity to be sufficient to meet our production needs 
in addition  the us dollar to mexican peso exchange rate weakened during fiscal  as compared to the corresponding prior year period 
this had the effect of increasing our per pound costs  which  as a result  negatively impacted gross margins 
rfg gross profit for rfg for the year ended october   when compared to the same prior year period  increased million  or 
as the acquisition was completed on june   only five months of sales are included in fiscal year selling  general and administrative change change dollars in thousands selling  general and administrative percentage of net sales selling  general and administrative expenses include costs of marketing and advertising  sales expenses and other general and administrative costs

for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
the qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance  which requires that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount
