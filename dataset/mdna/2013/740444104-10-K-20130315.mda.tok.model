our primary products support  protect  connect  terminate  and secure cables and wires 
we also provide solar hardware systems and mounting hardware for a variety of solar power applications 
our goal is to continue to achieve profitable growth as a leader in the innovation  development  manufacture  and marketing of technically advanced products and services related to energy  communications  and cable systems and to take advantage of this leadership position to sell additional quality products in familiar markets 
we have sales and manufacturing operations in different countries 
we report our segments in four geographic regions plp usa  the americas includes operations in north and south america without plp usa  emea europe  middle east africa and asia pacific in accordance with accounting standards codified in financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  segment reporting 
each segment distributes a full range of our primary products 
our plp usa segment is comprised of our us operations manufacturing our traditional products primarily supporting our domestic energy and telecommunications products 
our other three segments  the americas  emea and asia pacific  support our energy  telecommunications  data communication  and solar products in each respective geographical region 
the segment managers responsible for each region report directly to the company s chief executive officer  who is the chief operating decision maker  and are accountable for the financial results and performance of their entire segment for which they are responsible 
the business components within each segment are managed to maximize the results of the entire company rather than the results of any individual business component of the segment 
we evaluate segment performance and allocate resources based on several factors primarily based on sales and net income 
recent developments we acquired electropar limited on july  pursuant to the purchase agreement  we acquired all of the equity outstanding of electropar for nz million or million  net of a customary post closing working capital adjustment of 
million 
electropar designs  manufactures and markets pole line and substation hardware for the global electrical utility industry 
electropar is based in new zealand with a subsidiary operation in australia 
we believe that the acquisition of electropar has strengthened and will continue to strengthen our position in the power distribution  transmission and substation hardware markets and expand our presence in the asia pacific region 

table of contents in january and march  we had two acquisitions 
from an accounting perspective  both acquisitions were immaterial to the company 
on january   we acquired australian electricity systems pty ltd aes in australia for million  net of cash received and working capital adjustments 
on march   we purchased all of the assets of forma line industries cc in south africa for 
million  net of cash received and working capital adjustments 
both acquisitions expanded our product line offerings  manufacturing capacity and provided locations in close proximity to our customers in our emea and asia pacific segments 
market overview our business continues to be concentrated in the energy and communications markets 
during the past several years  industry consolidation continued as distributors and service provider consolidations took place in our major markets 
this trend is expected to continue in the sluggish global economy coupled with a depressed us housing market have affected  and could continue to affect construction projects and negatively impact growth opportunities in our core markets in the us and countries such as spain  poland and great britain where the financial situation is expected to be similar going forward 
in  we again experienced growth in our energy market 
we continued to see the investment in renewable energy projects  new transmission grids  new technologies  and upgrading and maintenance of the existing energy infrastructure 
we expect the distribution energy market to be relatively flat in but anticipate continued growth in demand for transmission and fiber optic products 
we believe that the acquisitions of dulmison from tyco electronics in december and electropar in july further contributed to our leadership position and have enabled us to enhance the scope of our product lines and the technology we provide to the energy market 
the spacer  spacer damper and stockbridge damper product lines fit well and complement our product offerings and enable us to offer the most comprehensive line of products in the industry 
we further strengthened our overall presence in the asia pacific region with the acquisition of electropar in auckland  new zealand 
with demand for electrical power continuing to increase  especially in many fast growing areas of the world  we believe that our leadership position in the market will enable us to take advantage of prospects for continued growth as the transmission grid is enhanced and extended 
our international business is more concentrated in the energy markets 
historically  our international sales were primarily related to the distribution portion of the energy market but have grown through acquisition and new product development to include a significant contribution from the transmission market 
we believe that we are well positioned to supply the needs of the world s diverse energy market requirements as a result of our strategically located operations and array of product designs and technologies 
our communication business in continued to face challenges throughout the world 
many communications customers continued with lower levels of capital and operational spending as the global economic downturn continued to negatively impact consumer spending on communication services 
we continue to intensely focus on our customers and put resources towards new product development efforts 
these efforts were directed at customer premise and demarcation applications which are the final connections between the network and the end consumer 
as economic conditions improve we believe our efforts in these areas will lead to growth in our communications business 
opportunities for growth also look promising internationally where deployment of fixed line telecommunications services and broadband penetration rates remain low as a percentage of the total population

working capital  liquidity and capital resources management assessment of liquidity we measure liquidity on the basis of our ability to meet short term and long term operating needs  fund additional investments  including acquisitions  and make dividend payments to shareholders 
significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities  capital expenditures  cash dividends  business acquisitions and access to bank lines of credit 
our investments include expenditures required for equipment and facilities as well as expenditures in support of our strategic initiatives 
in  we used cash of million for capital expenditures 
we ended the fourth quarter of with million of cash and cash equivalents 
we have adequate sources of liquidity including a borrowing capacity of million and believe we have the ability to generate cash to meet existing or reasonably likely future cash requirements 
our cash and cash equivalents are held in various locations throughout the world 
at december   the majority of our cash and cash equivalents are held outside the us we expect accumulated non us cash balances will remain outside of the non us and that we will meet us liquidity needs through future cash flows  use of us cash balances  external borrowings  or some combination of these sources 

table of contents we complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing financial statements for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk

we believe our future operating cash flows will be more than sufficient to cover debt repayments  other contractual obligations  capital expenditures and dividends 
in addition  we believe our borrowing capacity provides substantial financial resources if needed to supplement funding of capital expenditures and or acquisitions 
we do not believe we would increase our debt to a level that would have a material adverse impact upon results of operations or financial condition 
we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the united states  which  except for current earnings  is deemed to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions 
we currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgment and uncertainties  and potentially may result in materially different outcomes under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with fasb asc  revenue recognition 
we recognize sales when title passes to the customer either when goods are shipped  with no right of return  or when they are delivered and based on the terms of the sale  there is persuasive evidence of an agreement  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue related to shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in net sales and the related shipping and handling costs are included in cost of products sold 
receivable allowances we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we record estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable based upon the number of days the accounts are past due  the current business environment  and specific information such as bankruptcy or liquidity issues of customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
during  we recorded a provision for doubtful accounts of 
million 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents approximately of our trade receivables at december  and of our trade receivables at december  excess and obsolescence reserves we provide excess and obsolescence reserves to state inventories at the lower of cost or estimated market value 
we identify inventory items which have had no usage or are in excess of the usages over the historical to months 
a management team with representatives from marketing  manufacturing  engineering and finance reviews these inventory items  determines the disposition of the inventory and assesses the estimated market value based on their knowledge of the product and market conditions 
these conditions include  among other things  future demand for product  product utility  unique customer order patterns or unique raw material purchase patterns  changes in customer and quality issues 
at december  the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was of gross inventory and at december   the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was of gross inventory 
if the impact of market conditions deteriorates from those projected by management  additional inventory reserves may be necessary 
impairment of long lived assets we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the discounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying value of those items 
our cash flows are based on historical results adjusted to reflect the best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is then reduced to fair value 
the estimates of fair value represent the best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 

table of contents goodwill we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology  market comparables  and an overall market capitalization reasonableness test in computing fair value by reporting unit 
we then compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value to assess if goodwill has been impaired 
based on the assumptions as to growth  discount rates and the weighting used for each respective valuation methodology  results of the valuations could be significantly changed 
however  we believe that the methodologies and weightings used are reasonable and result in appropriate fair values of the reporting units 
our measurement date for our annual impairment test is october of each year 
we performed our annual impairment tests for goodwill as of october   and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value was required 
there were no trigger events during and as such  only the annual impairment tests were performed 
deferred tax assets deferred taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we establish a valuation allowance to record our deferred tax assets at an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to expense in the period such determination was made 
uncertain tax positions we identify tax positions taken on the federal  state  local and foreign income tax returns filed or to be filed 
a tax position can include a reduction in taxable income reported in a previously filed tax return or expected to be reported on a future tax return that impacts the measurement of current or deferred income tax assets or liabilities in the period being reported  a decision not to file a tax return  an allocation or a shift of income between jurisdictions  the characterization of income or a decision to exclude reporting taxable income in a tax return  or a decision to classify a transaction  entity or other position in a tax return as tax exempt 
we determine whether a tax position is an uncertain or a routine business transaction tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained at the full amount upon examination 
under fasb asc formerly fin  tax benefits from uncertain tax positions that reduce our current or future income tax liability  are reported in our financial statements only to the extent that each benefit was recognized and measured under a two step approach 
the first step requires us to assess whether each tax position based on its technical merits and facts and circumstances as of the reporting date  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
the second step measures the amount of tax benefit that we recognize in the financial statements  based on a cumulative probability approach 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not threshold that is not highly certain is measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority  assuming that the tax authority has examined the position and has full knowledge of all relevant information 
asc requires subjectivity of judgments to identify outcomes and to assign probability in order to estimate the settlement amount 
we provide estimates in order to determine settlement amounts 
during the year ended december   we recognized an expense of less than 
million for uncertain tax positions 
at december   the total reserve for uncertain tax positions is million 

table of contents pensions we record obligations and expenses related to pension benefit plans based on actuarial valuations  which include key assumptions on discount rates  expected returns on plan assets and compensation increases 
these actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as appropriate 
the effect of modifications is generally recorded or amortized over future periods 
the discount rate of at december  reflects an analysis of yield curves as of the end of the year and the schedule of expected cash needs of the plan 
the expected long term return on plan assets of reflects the plan s historical returns and represents our best estimate of the likely future returns on the plan s asset mix 
we believe the assumptions used in recording obligations under the plans are reasonable based on prior experience  market conditions and the advice of plan actuaries 
however  an increase in the discount rate would decrease the plan obligations and the net periodic benefit cost  while a decrease in the discount rate would increase the plan obligations and the net periodic benefit cost 
in addition  an increase in the expected long term return on plan assets would decrease the net periodic pension cost  while a decrease in expected long term return on plan assets would increase the net periodic pension cost 
on december   we approved a freeze on further benefit accruals under the plp usa hourly employee pension plan and notified the participants of the freeze on december  beginning february   participants will cease earning additional benefits under the plan and no new participants will enter the plan 
the plan freeze required an evaluation of the plans assets and obligations as of december   which resulted in a non cash curtailment gain of million  which was recognized in the other comprehensive income loss during the fourth quarter the measurement of the plans assets and obligations also resulted in a reduction in our pension liability of million 
the evaluation did not have an effect on other components of net periodic pension expense for the year ended december  recently adopted accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued accounting standards updates asu which provides an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two step test for goodwill impairment 
if an entity believes  as a result of its qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative impairment test is required 
otherwise  no further testing is required 
the revised standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  our measurement date for our annual impairment test is october of each year 
the adoption of this asu did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrss to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that fair value measurements and disclosure requirements are similar between gaap and ifrs 
this guidance changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 
the amendments in this asu are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  and are applied prospectively 
the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows or disclosures 
in june  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 presentation of comprehensive income asu 
the amendments in asu allow an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in both instances  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
asu eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the amendments in asu do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
in december  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income  deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in asu  to defer the effective date of the specific requirement to present items that are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income to net income alongside their respective components of net income and other comprehensive income 
we adopted this guidance on january   presenting other comprehensive income in a separate statement following the statement of consolidated income 
the adoption of this guidance concerns disclosure only and did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents in july  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other asu 
asu amends current guidance to allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test 
under this amendment  an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
asu applies to all companies that have indefinite lived intangible assets reported in their financial statements 
the provisions of asu are effective for reporting periods beginning after september  the adoption of asu did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
new accounting standards to be adopted changes to gaap are established by the fasb in the form of asu s to the fasb s asc 
in february  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
asu requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
in addition  an entity is required to present  either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same period 
for other amounts  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures required under us gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts 
the amendments are effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of asu on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company operates manufacturing facilities and offices around the world and uses fixed and floating rate debt to finance the company s global operations 
as a result  the company is subject to business risks inherent in non us activities  including political and economic uncertainty  import and export limitations and market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company believes that the political and economic risks related to the company s international operations are mitigated due to the stability of the countries in which the company s largest international operations are located 
as of december   the company had no foreign currency forward exchange contract outstanding 
the company does not hold derivatives for trading purposes 
the company is exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates 
the company is subject to interest rate risk on its variable rate revolving credit facilities and term notes  which consisted of borrowings of million at december  a basis point increase in the interest rate would have resulted in an increase in interest expense of approximately 
million for the year ended december  the company s primary currency rate exposures are related to foreign denominated debt  intercompany debt  forward exchange contracts  foreign denominated receivables and cash and short term investments 
a hypothetical change in currency rates would have a favorable unfavorable impact on fair values of million and on income before tax of 
million 
included in our accounting for defined benefit pension plan are assumptions on future discount rates and the expected return on plan assets 
the company considers current market conditions  including changes in interest rates and plan asset investment returns  as well as long term assumptions in determining these assumptions 
actuarial assumptions may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions or higher or lower withdrawal rates 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net pension expense or income recorded in the future 
a discount rate is used to determine the present value of future payments 
in general  our liability increases as the discount rate decreases and decreases as the discount rate increases 
the discount rate used to determine our future benefit obligation was and at december  and  respectively 
the discount rate is a significant factor in determining the amounts reported 
a basis point change in the discount rate of used at december  would have a million effect on plan s projected benefit obligation 
the company developed the expected return on plan assets by considering various factors which include targeted asset allocation percentages  historical returns  and expected future returns 
the company assumed an expected rate of return of in both and a basis point change in the expected rate of return would have 
million effect on the plan s subsequent year s net periodic pension cost
