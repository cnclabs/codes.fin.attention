results of operations the table below presents our net revenues amounts in thousands 
our results for the years presented are not comparable as the years ended december  and includes full year of operations for encore at wynn macau which opened on april  for the years ended december  net revenues las vegas operations macau operations reliance on only two resort complexes in two geographic regions for our operating cash flow exposes us to certain risks that competitors  whose operations are more geographically diversified  may be better able to 
table of contents control 
in addition to the concentration of operations in two resort complexes  many of our customers are premium gaming customers who wager on credit  thus exposing us to increased credit risk 
high end gaming also increases the potential for variability in our results 
operating measures certain key operating statistics specific to the gaming industry are included in our discussion of our operational performance for the periods for which a consolidated statement of income is presented 
there are two methods used to calculate win percentage in the casino industry 
in las vegas and in the general casino in macau  customers usually purchase cash chips at the gaming tables 
the cash and net markers used to purchase the cash chips are deposited in the gaming table s drop box 
this is the base of measurement that we use in the casino at our las vegas operations and in the general casino at our macau operations for calculating win percentage 
in our vip casino in macau  customers primarily purchase non negotiable chips  commonly referred to as rolling chips  from the casino cage and there is no deposit into a gaming table drop box from chips purchased from the cage 
non negotiable chips can only be used to make wagers 
winning wagers are paid in cash chips 
the loss of the non negotiable chips in the vip casino is recorded as turnover and provides a base for calculating vip casino win percentage 
because of this difference in chip purchase activity  the measurement base used in the general casino is not the same that is used in the vip casino 
it is customary in macau to measure vip casino play using this rolling chip method 
for  our expected win as a percentage of turnover was to 
the measurement method in las vegas and in the general casino in macau tracks the initial purchase of chips at the table while the measurement method in our vip casino in macau tracks the sum of all losing wagers 
accordingly  the base measurement in the vip casino is much larger than las vegas and the general casino in macau 
as a result  the expected win percentage with the same amount of gaming win is smaller in the vip casino in macau when compared to las vegas and the general casino in macau 
even though both use the same measurement method  we experience different table games win percentages in las vegas and the general casino in macau 
this difference is primarily due to the difference in the mix of table games and customer playing habits between the two casinos 
each type of table game has its own theoretical win percentage 
for  our expected table games win percentage in las vegas was to 
our expected table games win percentage in the general casino at wynn macau  which we have periodically revised based on our experience since the opening of the encore at wynn macau expansion  was to 
below are definitions of the statistics discussed table games win is the amount of drop or turnover that is retained and recorded as casino revenue 
drop is the amount of cash and net markers issued that are deposited in a gaming table s drop box 
turnover is the sum of all losing rolling chip wagers within our macau vip program 
rolling chips are identifiable chips that are used to track vip wagering volume turnover for purposes of calculating incentives 
slot win is the amount of handle representing the total amount wagered that is retained by us and is recorded as casino revenue 
average daily rate adr is calculated by dividing total room revenue including the retail value of promotional allowances less service charges  if any by total rooms occupied  including complimentary rooms 
revenue per available room revpar is calculated by dividing total room revenue including the retail value of promotional allowances less service charges  if any by total rooms available 
occupancy is calculated by dividing total occupied rooms  including complimentary rooms  by the total rooms available

food and beverage revenues at our las vegas operations increased million  while our macau operations increased million  as compared to the prior year 
the increase in las vegas is due primarily to strong business in our beach club and nightclubs 
retail revenues at our macau operations increased million  while retail at our las vegas operations decreased by million 
the increase at wynn macau is due primarily to strong same store sales growth combined with new stores from the first half of retail revenues at our las vegas operations decreased as we reconfigured the encore retail area and rebranded several retail outlets 
entertainment revenues decreased million from the prior year primarily due to a las vegas show that ended its run in november and another las vegas show that ended in april departmental  administrative and other expenses for the year ended december   departmental expenses included casino expenses of  million  room expenses of million  food and beverage expenses of million  and entertainment  retail and other expenses of million

also included are general and administrative expenses of approximately million and approximately million charged as a provision for doubtful accounts receivable 
casino expenses have decreased during the year ended december  due to lower volume which caused lower junket commission expense and lower gaming taxes at our macau operations where we incur a gaming tax and other levies at a rate totaling in accordance with the concession agreement 
although our room revenues increased million  room expenses increased only million as the revenue increase was driven primarily by increased adr 
food and beverage expenses increased over the prior year primarily due to additional nightclub promotional costs in las vegas 
the decrease in entertainment  retail and other expenses was driven by the conversion of certain owned retail stores to leased outlets in macau resulting in lower cost of sales 
general and administrative expense increased primarily due to legal and other costs incurred related to the share redemption and litigation with a former stockholder  higher advertising costs  development and other activities 
the provision for doubtful accounts decreased during the year ended december  as we recorded an adjustment of million that benefitted our reserve estimates for casino accounts receivable based on the results of historical collection patterns and current collection trends 

table of contents pre opening costs we began to incur pre opening costs during october related to the design and planning for our resort in the cotai area of macau 
we expect our pre opening costs to increase in the future as construction and development of our resort in cotai continues toward the expected completion in the first half of there were no pre opening expenses incurred during the year ended december  depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization for the year ended december   was million compared to million for the year ended december  depreciation expense decreased due to assets with a year life being fully depreciated as of september at our macau operations and assets with a three and six year life becoming fully depreciated throughout at our las vegas operations 
during the construction of our resorts  costs incurred in the construction of the buildings  improvements to land and the purchases of assets for use in operations were capitalized 
once these resorts opened  their assets were placed into service and we began recognizing the associated depreciation expense 
depreciation expenses will continue throughout the estimated useful lives of these assets 
in addition  we continually evaluate the useful life of our property and equipment  intangibles and other assets and adjust them when warranted 
the maximum useful life of assets at our macau operations is the remaining life of the gaming concession or land concession  which currently expire in june and august  respectively 
consequently  depreciation related to our macau operations is charged on an accelerated basis when compared to our las vegas operations

adjusted property ebitda we use adjusted property ebitda to manage the operating results of our segments 
adjusted property ebitda is earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  pre opening costs  property charges and other  corporate expenses  intercompany golf course and water rights leases  stock based compensation  and other non operating income and expenses  and includes equity in income from unconsolidated affiliates 
adjusted property ebitda is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because we believe that it is widely used to measure the performance  and as a basis for valuation  of gaming companies 
we use adjusted property ebitda as a measure of the operating performance of our segments and to compare the operating performance of our properties with those of our competitors 
we also present adjusted property ebitda because it is used by some investors as a way to measure a company s ability to incur and service debt  make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements 
gaming companies have historically reported ebitda as a supplement to financial measures in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand alone basis  gaming companies  including us  have historically excluded from their ebitda calculations pre opening expenses  property charges  corporate expenses and stock based compensation that do not relate to the management of specific casino properties
