overview we are a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts  tools  supplies  equipment and accessories in the united states 
we are one of the largest automotive aftermarket specialty retailers  selling our products to both do it yourself diy and professional service provider customers 
our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts  maintenance items  accessories  a complete line of auto body paint and related materials  automotive tools and professional service provider service equipment 
our extensive product line includes an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer 
for many of our product offerings  this quality differentiation reflects good  better  and best alternatives 
our sales and total gross margin dollars are highest for the best quality category of products 
consumers willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry 
as of december   we operated  stores in states 
operating within the retail industry  we are influenced by a number of general macroeconomic factors including  but not limited to  fuel costs  unemployment rates  consumer preferences and spending habits and competition 
the difficult conditions that affected the overall macroeconomic environment in recent years continue to impact o reilly and the retail sector in general 
we believe that the average consumer s tendency has been to trade down to lower quality products during the recent challenging macroeconomic conditions 
we have ongoing initiatives aimed at tailoring our product offering to adjust to customers changing preferences  however  we also continue to have initiatives focused on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of purchasing up on the value spectrum 
we believe these ongoing initiatives targeted at marketing higher quality products will result in our customers willingness to return to purchasing up on the value spectrum in the future as the us economy recovers  however  we cannot predict whether  when  or the manner in which  these economic conditions will change 
we believe the key drivers of current and future demand of the products sold within the automotive aftermarket include the number of us miles driven  number of us registered vehicles  new light vehicle registrations  average vehicle age and unemployment 
number of miles driven the number of total miles driven in the us heavily influences the demand for the repair and maintenance products sold within the automotive aftermarket 
historically  the long term trend in the total miles driven in the us has steadily increased  however  according to the department of transportation  total miles driven in the us have remained relatively flat since as the us has experienced difficult macroeconomic conditions 
we believe that as the us economy recovers and the level of unemployment declines  annual miles driven will return to historical growth rates and continue to drive demand for the industry 
number of us registered vehicles  new light vehicle registrations and average vehicle age the total number of vehicles on the road and the average age of the us vehicle population also heavily influence the demand for products sold within the automotive aftermarket industry 
as reported by the automotive aftermarket industry association aaia  the total number of registered vehicles has increased over the past decade  from million light vehicles in to million light vehicles in annual new light vehicle registrations  have declined over the past decade  from million registrations in to million registrations in  however  the seasonally adjusted annual rate the saar of sales of light vehicles in the us increased to million as of december   indicating that the trend of declining new light vehicle registrations has reversed 
as reported by the aaia  vehicle scrappage rates have decreased from to  while the average age of the us vehicle population has increased over that decade  from years in to years in we believe this decrease in vehicle scrappage rates and increase in average age can be attributed to better engineered and manufactured vehicles  which can be reliably driven at higher miles due to better quality power trains and interiors and exteriors  and the consumer s willingness to invest in maintaining their higher mileage  better built vehicles 
as the average age of the vehicle on the road increases  a larger percentage of miles are being driven by vehicles which are outside of a manufacturer warranty 
these out of warranty  older vehicles generate strong demand for automotive aftermarket products as they go through more routine maintenance cycles  have more frequent mechanical failures and generally require more maintenance than newer vehicles 
based on this change in consumer sentiment surrounding the length of time older vehicles can be reliably driven at higher mileages  we believe consumers will continue to keep their vehicles even longer as the economy recovers maintaining the trend of an aging vehicle population 
unemployment unemployment rates and continued uncertainty surrounding the overall economic health of the us have had a negative impact on consumer confidence and the level of consumer discretionary spending 
the annual us unemployment rate over the past two years has remained at year highs 
we believe macroeconomic uncertainties and the potential for future joblessness can motivate consumers to find ways to save money  which can be an important factor in the consumer s decision to defer the purchase of a new vehicle and maintain their existing vehicle 
while the deferral of vehicle purchases has led to an increase in vehicle maintenance  long term trends of high unemployment could continue to impede the growth of annual miles driven  as well as decrease consumer discretionary spending  both of which negatively impact demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket industry 
as of december   the us unemployment rate decreased slightly to from as of december  we believe that as the economy recovers  unemployment will return to more historic levels and we will see a corresponding increase in commuter traffic as unemployed individuals return to work 
aided by these increased commuter miles  overall annual us miles driven should begin to grow resulting in continued demand for automotive aftermarket products 
we remain confident in our ability to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core o reilly values of customer service and expense control 
key events and recent developments several key events have had or may have a significant impact on our operations and are identified below under the company s share repurchase program  as approved by the board of directors in january of  the company may  from time to time  repurchase shares of its common stock  solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices  based on a variety of factors such as price  corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions 
the company and its board of directors may increase or otherwise modify  renew  suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time  without prior notice 
the company s board of directors approved resolutions to increase the authorization under the share repurchase program by an additional million on each of june   august   and november   raising the cumulative authorization under the share repurchase program to billion 
the additional million authorizations are effective for a year period  and the most recent authorization expires on november  as of february   we had repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of billion under this program 
on august   the company issued million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due senior notes due at a price to the public of of their face value with united missouri bank  na umb as trustee 
interest on the senior notes due is payable on march and september of each year  beginning on march   and is computed on the basis of a day year 
at the close of business on december   the company completed the purchase of the auto parts related assets of vip parts  tires service vip 
the asset purchase included stores located throughout maine  new hampshire and massachusetts  as well as a distribution center located in lewiston  maine

comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery  sales to independent parts stores and sales to team members 
the following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended december  in millions increase in sales for the year ended december   compared to the same period in store sales comparable store sales non comparable store sales sales for stores opened throughout  excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable store sales sales in for stores that have closed sales for stores opened throughout non store sales includes sales of machinery and sales to independent parts stores and team members total increase in sales we believe the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of high levels of customer service  superior inventory availability  a broader selection of products offered in most stores  a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events  continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores  compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both diy and professional service provider customers 
our comparable store sales increase for the year ended december   was driven by an increase in average ticket values  partially offset by a decrease in diy customer transaction counts 
the improvement in average ticket values was a result of the continued growth of the more costly  hard part categories  as a percentage of our total sales 
the growth in the hard part categories is driven by the increase of professional service provider customer sales as a percentage of our total sales mix and the continued growth in diy hard part sales  as consumers continue to maintain and repair their vehicles 
the strong increases in our professional service provider customer transaction counts  driven by our acquired markets  have been offset by pressured diy transaction counts 
diy customer transaction counts continue to be negatively impacted by macroeconomic pressures on disposable income  including sustained unemployment levels above historical averages 
both diy and professional service provider customer transaction counts also continue to be negatively impacted by better engineered and more technically advanced vehicles  which have been manufactured in recent years 
these vehicles require less frequent repairs and the component parts are more durable and last for longer periods of time  however  when repairs are required  the cost of the repair is typically greater 
we opened net  new stores and acquired stores during the year ended december   compared to net  new stores for the year ended december  at december   we operated  stores in states compared to  stores in states at december  we anticipate new store unit growth to increase to net  new stores in gross profit gross profit for the year ended december   increased to billion or of sales from billion or of sales for the same period one year ago  representing an increase of 
the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increases in sales from new stores and the increases in comparable store sales at existing stores 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to distribution center dc efficiencies  acquisition cost improvements and improved inventory shrinkage  partially offset by the impact of increased commercial sales as a percentage of the total sales mix 
dc efficiencies are the result of continued leverage on our increased sales volumes and more tenured and experienced dc team members in our maturing dcs 
in addition  during we increased our store level inventories as a component of our focus on providing higher service levels 
the costs to move this additional inventory into the stores were more efficient than routine restocking activity and  as a result  we realized a one time benefit from capitalized distribution costs 
this capitalization of costs benefited gross margin by approximately basis points versus the prior year  however  we do not anticipate realizing this excess benefit in future periods 
acquisition cost improvements are the result of our ongoing negotiations with our vendors to improve our inventory purchase costs 
the improved inventory shrinkage is driven by our continued focus on inventory control and accountability through our distribution and store networks 
commercial sales typically carry a lower gross profit as a percentage of sales than diy sales  as volume discounts are granted on wholesale transactions to professional service provider customers  therefore  creating pressure on our gross profit as a percentage of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for the year ended december   increased to billion or of sales from billion or of sales for the same period one year ago  representing an increase of 
the increase in total sg a dollars was primarily the result of additional employees  facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count 
the slight increase in sg a as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of our focus on store staffing levels to continue to deliver industry leading customer service while adjusting to the slower sales environment  as well as an overall deleverage on soft comparable store sales 
operating income as a result of the impacts discussed above  operating income for the year ended december   increased to million or of sales from million or of sales for the same period one year ago  representing an increase of 
other income and expense total other expense for the year ended december   decreased to million or of sales  from million or of sales for the same period one year ago  representing a decrease of 
the decrease in total other expense for the year ended december   was primarily due to one time charges related to our financing transactions that were completed in january of discussed in detail below  partially offset by increased interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings and increased amortization of debt issuance costs as compared to the prior year 
income taxes our provision for income taxes for the year ended december   increased to million effective tax rate from million effective tax rate for the same period one year ago  representing an increase of 
the increase in our provision for income taxes was due to the increase in our taxable income 
net income as a result of the impacts discussed above  net income for the year ended december   increased to million or of sales  from million or of sales for the same period one year ago  representing an increase of 
earnings per share our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december   increased to on million shares from on million shares for the same period one year ago 
the impact of share repurchases during on diluted earnings per share was an increase of approximately 
adjustments for nonrecurring and non operating events our results for the year ended december   included nonrecurring income related to a settlement between the sec and a former csk officer that resulted in the reimbursement to o reilly  as successor issuer to csk for sec purposes  of million million  net of tax of incentive based compensation and stock sale profits previously received by the officer 
this clawback amount was included in operating income on our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  our results for the year ended december   also included one time charges associated with the new financing transactions we completed on january  the one time charges included a non cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs related to our previous abl credit facility in the amount of million million  net of tax and a charge related to the termination of our interest rate swap agreements in the amount of million million  net of tax 
the charges related to our new financing transactions were included in other income expense on our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  the results discussed in the paragraph below are adjusted for these nonrecurring items and are reconciled to the most directly comparable gaap measure in the subsequent table 
adjusted operating income for the year ended december   increased to million or of sales from million or of sales for the same period one year ago 
adjusted net income for the year ended december  increased to million or of sales from million or of sales for the same period one year ago

we do not  nor do we suggest investors should  consider such non gaap financial measures in isolation from  or as a substitute for  gaap financial information 
we believe that the presentation of financial results and estimates excluding the impact of the non cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs  the charge related to the termination of interest rate swap contracts  and the former csk officer clawback  provide meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors  which is indicative of our core operations 
we exclude these items in judging our performance and believe this non gaap information is useful to investors as well 
material limitations of these non gaap measures are that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts 
we compensate for such limitations by presenting  in the table above  the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures 
compared to sales sales for the year ended december   increased million to billion from billion for the same period one year ago  representing an increase of 
comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery  sales to independent parts stores and sales to team members 
the following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended december  in millions increase in sales for the year ended december   compared to the same period in store sales comparable store sales non comparable store sales sales for stores opened throughout  excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable store sales sales in for stores that have closed sales for stores opened throughout non store sales includes sales of machinery and sales to independent parts stores and team members total increase in sales we believe the increased sales achieved by our stores are the result of high levels of customer service  superior inventory availability  a broader selection of products offered in most stores  a targeted promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events  continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of our stores  compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving both diy and professional service provider customers 
our comparable store sales increase for the year was driven by an increase in average ticket values  partially offset by a decline in customer transaction counts 
the improvement in average ticket values was the result of the continued growth of the higher priced  hard part categories as a percentage of our total sales  and the impact of increased raw material acquisition costs  which were passed through to increased selling prices during the period 
the growth in the hard part categories was driven by the increase of professional service provider sales as a percentage of our total sales mix and a shift in diy sales to the hard part categories 
during the year  diy customer transaction counts were negatively impacted by the continued pressure on disposable income that our customers faced as a result of increased fuel costs and sustained unemployment levels above historical averages  which offset strong increases in professional service provider transaction counts 
we opened net  new stores during the year ended december   compared to net  new stores for the year ended december  at december   we operated  stores in states compared to  stores in states at december  gross profit gross profit for the year ended december   increased to billion or of sales from billion or of sales for the same period one year ago  representing an increase of 
the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily a result of the increase in sales from new stores and the increase in comparable store sales at existing stores 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to a favorable product mix  improved acquisition costs  improved inventory shrinkage and distribution center efficiencies  partially offset by the impact of increased professional service provider sales as a percentage of the total sales mix 
the improvement in product mix was primarily driven by increased sales in the hard part categories  which typically generate a high gross profit as a percentage of sales 
increasing hard part sales is the result of strong demand as consumers retain and maintain their vehicles beyond manufacturer warranty periods and our strong growth in sales to professional service providers in the acquired markets 
the improved shrinkage was driven by our converted csk stores  which are now managed using the o reilly point of sale system pos  installed in all csk stores as they converted to the o reilly distribution systems throughout and the o reilly pos provides our store managers with better tools to track and control inventory  resulting in improved inventory shrinkage 
distribution center efficiencies were the result of leverage on increased sales volumes and more tenured and experienced distribution center team members in our newer dcs 
professional service provider sales in the acquired csk markets grew at a faster rate than total diy sales as a result of the enhanced distribution model in those markets  which supports the implementation of our dual market strategy 
professional service provider sales typically carry a lower overall gross profit as a percentage of sales than diy sales  as volume discounts are granted on wholesale transactions to professional service providers  consequently creating pressure on our gross profit as a percentage of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for the year ended december   increased to billion or of sales from billion or of sales for the same period one year ago  representing an increase of 
the increase in total sg a dollars was primarily the result of additional employees  facilities and vehicles to support our increased store count 
the decrease in sg a as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of increased leverage of store occupancy and headquarters costs on strong comparable store sales  improved store payroll efficiencies and positive trends related to health benefits  partially offset by increased fuel costs for our store delivery vehicles supporting our growing commercial business 
operating income operating income for the year ended december   increased to million or of sales from million or of sales for the same period one year ago  representing an increase of 
the increase in operating income during the year was primarily due to the impacts discussed above  as well as million of nonrecurring income in the current year related to a settlement between the securities and exchange commission sec and a former csk officer that resulted in the reimbursement to csk of incentive based compensation and stock sale profits previously received by the officer discussed in detail below see note legal matters to the consolidated financial statements versus a million charge to operating income in the prior year  related to the previously announced legacy united states department of justice doj investigation of csk discussed in detail below see note legal matters to the consolidated financial statements 
the increase in operating income as a percentage of sales was the result of our improvements in gross margin and significant leverage on fixed sg a from strong comparable store sales 
other income and expense total other expense for the year ended december   increased to million or of sales  from million or of sales for the same period one year ago  representing an increase of 
the increase in total other expense for the year was primarily due to one time charges related to our new financing transactions that were completed in january of discussed in detail below  offset by decreased interest expense on a lower average interest rate on outstanding borrowings  a lower facility fee on our revolving credit facility and less amortization of debt issuance costs in the current period as compared to the borrowing rates  facility fee and amortization of debt issuance costs in the prior period 
in addition  during  we recognized a nonrecurring  non operating gain of million related to the favorable settlement of a note receivable acquired in the acquisition of csk discussed in detail below 
income taxes our provision for income taxes for the year ended december   increased to million effective tax rate from million effective tax rate for the same period in the prior year  representing an increase of 
the increase in our provision for income taxes was due to the increase in our taxable income 
the decrease in the effective rate was primarily the result of the million charge recorded in related to the legacy csk doj investigation  discussed in detail below  which was not deductible for tax purposes 
net income as a result of the impacts discussed above  net income for the year ended december   increased to million or of sales  from million or of sales for the same period in the prior year  representing an increase of 
earnings per share our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december   increased to on million shares from on million shares for the same period in the prior year 
the impact of share repurchases during on diluted earnings per share was an increase of approximately

this clawback amount was included in operating income on our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  our results for the year ended december   also included one time charges associated with the new financing transactions we completed on january  the one time charges included a non cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs related to our previous abl credit facility in the amount of million million  net of tax and a charge related to the termination of our interest rate swap agreements in the amount of million million  net of tax 
the charges related to our new financing transactions were included in other income expense on our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  our results for the year ended december   included a nonrecurring  non operating gain in other income expense of million million  net of tax related to the favorable settlement of a note receivable acquired in the csk acquisition  as well as a charge related to the legacy doj investigation into csk s pre acquisition historical accounting practices 
we accrued million during in anticipation of executing a non prosecution agreement npa among the doj  csk and o reilly and paying a one time monetary penalty of million

liquidity and capital resources our long term business strategy requires capital to open new stores  fund strategic acquisitions  expand distribution infrastructure  operate and maintain existing stores and may include the opportunistic repurchase of shares of our common stock through our board approved share repurchase program 
the primary sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operations and borrowed under our revolving credit facility 
decreased demand for our products or changes in customer buying patterns could negatively impact our ability to generate funds from operations 
additionally  decreased demand or changes in buying patterns could impact our ability to meet the debt covenants of our credit agreement and  therefore  negatively impact the funds available under our revolving credit facility 
we believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and availability under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund both our short term and long term capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels 
liquidity and related ratios the following table highlights our liquidity and related ratios as of december  and dollars in millions december  percentage liquidity and related ratios change current assets quick assets current liabilities working capital total debt total equity current ratio quick ratio debt to equity quick assets include cash  cash equivalents and receivables 
working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities 
current ratio is calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities 
quick ratio is calculated as current assets  less inventories  divided by current liabilities 
debt to equity is calculated as total debt divided by shareholders equity 
current liabilities increased  total debt increased and total equity decreased from to the increase in current liabilities was primarily due to the increase in accounts payable as a result of the impact of our enhanced vendor financing program and the additional vendor participation during the year 
our accounts payable to inventory ratio was as of december   as compared to one year prior 
the increase in total debt was attributable to the issuance of our unsecured million senior notes during the decrease in total equity resulted from the impact of repurchase activity under our share repurchase program on additional paid in capital and retained earnings  partially offset by an increase in retained earnings from strong net income for the year and an increase in additional paid in capital from the proceeds of stock option exercises  and related tax benefits  executed under our director and employee share based compensation plans

operating activities the increase in cash provided by operating activities in compared to was primarily due to the increase in net income for the year adjusted for the effect of non cash depreciation and amortization charges and the one time  non cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs in conjunction with the retirement of our abl credit facility in january of  decreases in net inventory investment and other assets and increases in income taxes payable adjusted for the effect of non cash change in deferred income taxes and the excess tax benefit from stock options exercised and other current liabilities 
net inventory investment reflects our investment in inventory  net of the amount of accounts payable to vendors 
our net inventory investment continues to decrease as a result of the impact of our enhanced vendor financing programs 
our vendor financing programs enable us to reduce overall supply chain costs and negotiate extended payment terms with our vendors 
our accounts payable to inventory ratio was and at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in other assets was primarily the result of the timing of payments from vendors for receivables due to the company under various programs 
the increase in income taxes payable  adjusted for the non cash impacts discussed above  was primarily the result of the prepayment of income taxes during the increase in other current liabilities was primarily the result of the payment  during  for the one time monetary penalty to the doj for the legacy csk doj investigation 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in compared to was primarily due to strong net income for the year adjusted for the effect of non cash depreciation and amortization charges  the one time  non cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs in conjunction with the retirement of our abl credit facility in january of and deferred income taxes and a significant decrease in net inventory investment  partially offset by a decrease in other current liabilities driven by the payment of the one time penalty to the doj for the legacy csk doj investigation 
our net inventory investment significantly decreased as a result of the impact of our enhanced vendor financing programs as well as our ongoing efforts to remove excess inventory from our systems 
our accounts payable to inventory ratio was and at december  and  respectively 
our efforts to remove excess inventory from our systems resulted in a decrease in total inventory of million during the year  despite the fact that we opened new stores during the year 
investing activities the decrease in cash used in investing activities in compared to was primarily the result of decreased capital expenditures during  partially offset by small acquisitions during the year 
total capital expenditures were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the decrease in capital expenditures during  as compared to  was primarily related to the mix of owned versus leased stores opened 
we were able to find real estate with attractive lease factors during and as a result  opened a larger number of leased locations during as compared to the year prior 
opening a new store in a leased location requires a smaller capital investment than opening an owned location 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities in compared to was primarily the result of decreased capital expenditures 
during  we completed the comprehensive expansion of our distribution system in the csk markets and the conversion of the csk stores to the o reilly pos  resulting in reduced levels of conversion related capital expenditures during we opened   and net  new stores in   and  respectively  and acquired stores in we plan to open net  new stores in the costs associated with the opening of a new store including the cost of land acquisition  improvements  fixtures  vehicles  net inventory investment and computer equipment are estimated to average approximately million to million  however  such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease  rather than purchase  the store site 
financing activities the increase in net cash used in financing activities during compared to was primarily attributable to the impact of repurchases of our common stock during  in accordance with our board approved share repurchase program and greater net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt during  partially offset by an increase in the net proceeds from the exercise of stock options issued under the company s incentive programs and the related tax benefits during the increase in net cash used in financing activities during compared to is primarily attributable to the impact of repurchases of our common stock during in accordance with our board approved share repurchase program  which was partially offset by an increase in net long term borrowings in as compared to net repayments under our facilities during the net borrowings in are the result of proceeds from the issuance of our senior notes due and our senior notes due in january and september of  respectively  partially offset by the repayment and termination of our previous abl credit facility and the payment of debt issuance costs related to the issuance of our senior notes and the establishment of our new unsecured revolving credit facility 
the net repayments under our facilities in were the result of our focus on using available cash on hand to reduce the level of outstanding borrowings under our secured abl credit facility 
credit facilities on january   we entered into a new credit agreement for a five year million unsecured revolving credit facility revolving credit facility arranged by ba and barclays capital  which was scheduled to mature in january of during  we amended the unsecured revolving credit facility  which decreased the facility to million and reduced the fees and interest rate margins for borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
the amendment also extended the maturity of the revolving credit facility to september of in conjunction with the amendment to the revolving credit facility  we recognized a one time charge related to the modification to the credit facility in the amount of million  which is included in other income expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  the revolving credit facility includes a million sub limit for the issuance of letters of credit and a million sub limit for swing line borrowings 
as described in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility  we may  from time to time subject to certain conditions  increase the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to million 
we had stand by letters of credit  primarily to satisfy workers compensation  general liability and other insurance policies  in the amount of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
as of december  and  we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
on july   we entered into a credit agreement for a five year asset based revolving credit facility  which was scheduled to mature in july of at december   we had outstanding borrowings of million under the abl credit facility  of which million were not covered under an interest rate swap contract 
all outstanding borrowings under the abl credit facility were repaid  and all related interest rate swap transaction contracts were terminated on january   and the abl credit facility was retired concurrent with the issuance of our senior notes due  as further described below 
in conjunction with the retirement of our abl credit facility  we recognized a one time non cash charge to write off the balance of debt issuance costs related to the abl credit facility in the amount of million and a one time charge related to the termination of our interest rate swap contracts in the amount of million  which are included in other income expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  senior notes senior notes due on january   we issued million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due senior notes due at a price to the public of of their face value with united missouri bank  na umb as trustee 
interest on the senior notes due is payable on january and july of each year  which began on july   and is computed on the basis of a day year 
senior notes due on september   we issued million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due senior notes due at a price to the public of of their face value with umb as trustee 
interest on the senior notes due is payable on march and september of each year  which began on march   and is computed on the basis of a day year 
senior notes due on august   we issued million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due senior notes due at a price to the public of of their face value with umb as trustee 
interest on the senior notes due is payable on march and september of each year  beginning on march   and is computed on the basis of a day year 
the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes due were used to pay fees and expenses related to the offering  with the remainder intended to be used to repay borrowings outstanding from time to time under the revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes  including share repurchases 
the senior notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our subsidiaries subsidiary guarantors that incurs or guarantees our obligations under our revolving credit facility or certain of our other debt or any of our subsidiary guarantors 
the guarantees are joint and several and full and unconditional  subject to certain customary automatic release provisions  including release of the subsidiary guarantor s guarantee under our credit agreement and certain other debt  or  in certain circumstances  the sales or other disposition of a majority of the voting power of the capital interest in  or of all or substantially all of the property of  the subsidiary guarantor 
each of the subsidiary guarantors is wholly owned  directly or indirectly  by us and we have no independent assets or operations other than those of our subsidiaries 
our only direct or indirect subsidiaries that would not be subsidiary guarantors would be minor subsidiaries 
neither we  nor any of our subsidiary guarantors  are subject to any material or significant restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries by dividend or loan or to transfer assets from such subsidiaries  except as provided by applicable law 
each of our senior notes is subject to certain customary covenants  with which we complied as of december  debt covenants the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to  among other things i create certain liens on assets to secure certain debt  ii enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions  and iii merge or consolidate with another company or transfer all or substantially all of our or its property  in each case as set forth in the indentures 
these covenants are  however  subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions 
the credit agreement contains covenants  including limitations on total outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility  a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of times through december   times through december   times through maturity  and a maximum adjusted consolidated leverage ratio of times through maturity 
the consolidated leverage ratio includes a calculation of adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  rent and stock option compensation expense ebitdar to adjusted debt 
adjusted debt includes outstanding debt  outstanding stand by letters of credit  six times rent expense and excludes any premium or discount recorded in conjunction with the issuance of long term debt 
in the event that we should default on any covenant contained within the credit agreement  certain actions may be taken against us  including but not limited to possible termination of credit extensions  immediate payment of outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest and litigation from our lenders 
we had a fixed charge coverage ratio of times and times as of december  and  respectively  and an adjusted debt to adjusted ebitdar ratio of times and times as of december  and  respectively  remaining in compliance with all covenants related to the borrowing arrangements 
under our current financing plan  we have targeted an adjusted debt to adjusted ebitdar ratio range of times to times

we do not  nor do we suggest investors should  consider such non gaap financial measures in isolation from  or as a substitute for  gaap financial information 
we believe that the presentation of our fixed charge coverage ratio  adjusted debt to adjusted ebitdar and free cash flow provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that reflects the required covenants under our credit agreement 
we include these items in judging our performance and believe this non gaap information is useful to investors as well 
material limitations of these non gaap measures are that such measures do not reflect actual gaap amounts 
we compensate for such limitations by presenting  in the table above  the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures 
share repurchase program under our share repurchase program  as approved by our board of directors  we may  from time to time  repurchase shares of our common stock  solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices  based on a variety of factors such as price  corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions 
we may increase or otherwise modify  renew  suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time  without prior notice 
during  our board of directors approved resolutions to increase the cumulative authorization amount to billion 
the most recent million authorization is effective for a three year period and expires november  each prior million authorization was effective for a three year period beginning on the date of the additional authorization 
the following table identifies shares of the company s common stock that have been repurchased as part of our publicly announced share repurchase program in thousands  except per share data for the year ended december  shares repurchased average price per share total investment subsequent to the end of the year and through the date of this filing  we repurchased an additional million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at an average price of for a total investment of million 
we have repurchased a total of million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program since the inception of the program in january of through and including february   at an average price of for a total aggregate investment of billion 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of december   included commitments for short and long term debt arrangements  interest payments related to long term debt  future payments under non cancelable lease arrangements  self insurance reserves and purchase obligations for construction contract commitments  which are identified in the table below and are fully disclosed in note leasing and note commitments to the consolidated financial statements 
we expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows expected to be generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
deferred income taxes  which is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets  as well as commitments with various vendors for the purchase of inventory  are not reflected in the table below due to the absence of scheduled maturities  the nature of the account or the commitment s cancellation terms 
due to the absence of scheduled maturities  the timing of certain of these payments cannot be determined  except for amounts estimated to be payable in  which are included in current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets

swing line loans made under the revolving credit facility bear interest at the base rate plus the applicable margin described above 
in addition  we pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments in an amount equal to a percentage of such commitments  varying from to based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by moody s investor service  inc and standard poor s rating services  subject to limited exceptions 
based on our current credit ratings  our margin for base rate loans is  our margin for eurodollar rate loans is and our facility fee is 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the minimum lease payments above do not include certain tax  insurance and maintenance costs  which are also required contractual obligations under our operating leases but are generally not fixed and can fluctuate from year to year 
these expenses historically average approximately of the corresponding lease payments 
we use various self insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers compensation  vehicle and general liability  and employee health care benefits 
the self insurance reserves above are at the undiscounted obligation amount 
the self insurance reserves liabilities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at our estimate of their net present value and do not have scheduled maturities  however we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns 
we record a reserve for potential liabilities related to uncertain tax positions  including estimated interest and penalties  which are fully disclosed in note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements 
these estimates are not included in the above table because the timing related to the ultimate resolution or settlement of these positions cannot be determined 
as of december   we recorded a liability of million related to these uncertain tax positions on our consolidated balance sheets  all of which was included as a component of other liabilities 
off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet arrangements are transactions  agreements  or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
we have historically utilized various off balance sheet financial instruments  including sale leaseback and synthetic lease transactions  but we have not entered into any such transactions for over five years and do not plan to utilize off balance sheet arrangements in the future to fund our working capital requirements  operations or growth plans 
we issue stand by letters of credit provided by a million sub limit under the revolving credit facility that reduce our available borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
those letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation  general liability and other insurance policies 
substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a one year term from the date of issuance 
letters of credit totaling million and million were outstanding at december  and  respectively 
other than in connection with executing operating leases  we do not have any off balance sheet financing that has  or is reasonably likely to have  a material  current or future effect on our financial condition  cash flows  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
see contractual obligations and note commitments to the consolidated financial statements for information on our operating leases 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management 
management bases its assumptions  estimates  and adjustments on historical experience  current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required to establish these estimates 
management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with gaap 
however  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 
inventory obsolescence and shrink inventory  which consists of automotive hard parts  maintenance items  accessories and tools  is stated at the lower of cost or market 
the extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal 
the products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a relatively long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population 
we have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the life cycle of a given product and  accordingly  have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand 
we do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of a product line is lower than our recorded cost 
this reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate  at a given point in time  the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods 
ultimately  our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances 
we have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future 
we also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink 
we estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic  full physical inventories at our stores and dcs 
to the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage  we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances 
we have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates 
if unrecorded shrink changed from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at december   the financial impact would have been approximately million or of pretax income for the year ended december  accounts receivable we provide credit to our commercial customers in the ordinary course of business 
we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts on these receivables based on historical loss ratios and other relevant factors 
actual results have consistently been within management s expectations  and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future that will require a significant change in the assumptions or estimates we use to calculate our allowance for doubtful accounts 
however  if actual results differ from our estimates  we may be exposed to losses or gains 
if the allowance for doubtful accounts were changed from our estimated allowance at december   the financial impact would have been approximately million or of pretax income for the year ended december  valuation of long lived assets and goodwill we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values 
as part of the evaluation  we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment 
a potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset 
the estimate of cash flows includes management s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets 
our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets 
actual results could differ from these estimates  which could materially impact our impairment assessment 
we review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter  or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values 
we have not historically recorded an impairment to goodwill 
the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our company using the market approach 
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates  including estimates which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value 
in the future  if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired  we will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs  however  we do not believe there has been any change of events or circumstances that would indicate that a reevaluation of goodwill is required as of december   nor do we believe goodwill is at risk of failing impairment testing 
if the price of o reilly stock  which was a primary input used to determine our market capitalization during step one of goodwill impairment testing  changed by from the value used during testing  the results and our conclusions would not have changed and no further steps would have been required 
vendor concessions we receive concessions from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements  including co operative advertising  allowances for warranties  merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates 
co operative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program  specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes  are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred 
all other material vendor concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of inventory 
amounts receivable from vendors also include amounts due to us relating to vendor purchases and product returns 
management regularly reviews amounts receivable from vendors and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our vendors financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations 
based on our historical results and current assessment  we have not recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements  and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations 
the eventual ability of our vendors to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
warranty reserves we offer warranties on certain merchandise we sell with warranty periods ranging from days to limited lifetime warranties 
the risk of loss arising from warranty claims is typically the obligation of our vendors 
certain vendors provide upfront allowances to us in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims 
for this merchandise  when sold  we bear the risk of loss associated with the cost of warranty claims 
differences between vendor allowances received in lieu of warranty obligations and estimated warranty expense are recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales 
estimated warranty costs  which are recorded as obligations at the time of sale  are based on the historical failure rate of each individual product line 
our historical experience has been that failure rates are relatively consistent over time and that the ultimate cost of warranty claims has been driven by volume of units sold as opposed to fluctuations in failure rates or the variation of the cost of individual claims 
if warranty reserves were changed from our estimated reserves at december   the financial impact would have been approximately million or of pretax income for the year ended december  self insurance reserves we use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers compensation  general liability  vehicle liability  property loss  and team member health care benefits 
with the exception of certain team member health care benefit liabilities  employment related claims and litigation  certain commercial litigation and certain regulatory matters  we obtain third party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers compensation  general liability  vehicle liability or property loss claim 
when estimating our self insurance liabilities  we consider a number of factors  including historical claims experience and trend lines  projected medical and legal inflation  and growth patterns and exposure forecasts 
the assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations 
our calculation of self insurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities 
actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates  which may result in material losses or gains 
as we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods  we adjust our self insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information 
these liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value  using a credit adjusted discount rate 
these liabilities do not have scheduled maturities  but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns 
we could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities 
if self insurance reserves were changed from our estimated reserves at december   the financial impact would have been approximately million or of pretax income for the year ended december  closed property reserves we maintain reserves for closed stores and other properties that are no longer utilized in current operations 
we accrue for closed property operating lease liabilities using a credit adjusted discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining non cancelable lease payments  contractual occupancy costs and lease termination fees after the closing date  net of estimated sublease income 
the closed property lease liabilities are expected to be paid over the remaining lease terms 
we estimate sublease income and future cash flows based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located  our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and existing economic conditions 
adjustments to closed property reserves are made to reflect changes in estimated sublease income or actual exit costs from original estimates 
adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the changes become known 
if closed property reserves were changed from our estimated reserves at december   the financial impact would have been approximately million or of pretax income for the year ended december  legal reserves we maintain reserves for expenses associated with litigation for which o reilly is currently involved 
we are currently involved in litigation incidental to the ordinary conduct of our business 
we resolved the governmental investigations and litigation that were being conducted against csk and certain of csk s former employees for alleged conduct relating to periods prior to the acquisition date 
as a result of the acquisition  we incurred legal fees and costs related to such investigations  litigation and indemnity obligations 
our legal reserve was principally recorded as an assumed liability in our allocation of the purchase price of csk 
management  with the assistance of outside legal counsel  must make estimates of potential legal obligations and possible liabilities arising from such litigation and records reserves for these expenditures 
if legal reserves were changed from our estimated reserves at december   the financial impact would have been approximately million or of pretax income for the year ended december  taxes we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
we regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit 
the amount of such liabilities is based on various factors  such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority  experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings 
changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions and or changes in tax regulations 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented 
the estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions and actual results could differ from our estimates 
alternatively  we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but that would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position 
while our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion  our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority 
inflation and seasonality for the last three fiscal years  we have been successful  in many cases  in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs  economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases and selective forward buying 
to the extent our acquisition cost increased due to base commodity price increases industry wide  we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products 
as a result  we do not believe our operations have been materially  adversely affected by inflation 
to some extent  our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns 
while we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year  our store sales and profits have historically been higher in the second and third quarters april through september than in the first and fourth quarters october through march of the year 
quarterly results the following table sets forth certain quarterly unaudited operating data for fiscal and the unaudited quarterly information includes all adjustments which management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown 
the unaudited operating data presented below should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report  and the other financial information included therein

 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income asu 
under asu  an entity is required to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci by component 
in addition  an entity is required to present  either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of aoci by the respective line items of net income  but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures that provide additional details about those amounts 
asu does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in the financial statements 
we plan to adopt this guidance beginning with our first quarter ended march   the application of this guidance affects presentation only and therefore  is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our unsecured revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility with variable interest rates based on either a base rate or eurodollar rate  as defined in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility 
historically  we had entered into interest rate swap contracts to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risks associated with borrowings against our previous credit facility with variable interest rates  however  as of december   we did not have any interest rate swap contracts and had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we had outstanding fixed rate debt of billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
the fair value of our fixed rate debt was estimated at billion and billion as of december  and  respectively  which was determined by reference to quoted market prices 
we invest certain of our excess cash balances in short term  highly liquid instruments with maturities of days or less 
we do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances and we believe that our interest rate exposure is minimal 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million
