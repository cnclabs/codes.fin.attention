item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes contained in this report 
we are a clinical stage biotechnology company engaged in the research and development of innovative cancer therapeutics 
our mission is to produce novel drugs with differentiated mechanisms of action that will extend the lives of our patients 
these drugs target biological pathways implicated in a wide range of cancers 
we employ technologies such as our arqule kinase inhibitor platform akip tm to design and develop drugs that have the potential to fulfill this mission 
our product candidates and programs span a continuum of research and development ranging from drug discovery to advanced clinical testing 
they are based on our understanding of biological processes that lead to the proliferation and metastasis of cancer cells  combined with our ability to generate product candidates possessing certain pre selected  drug like properties 
we believe that these qualities  when present from the earliest stages of product development  increase the likelihood of producing safe  effective and marketable drugs 
our discovery and development efforts are also guided when possible by an understanding of the role of biomarkers  which are indicators of a particular biological condition or process and may predict the clinical benefit of our compounds in defined patient populations 
our lead product candidate is tivantinib arq  an orally administered  small molecule inhibitor of the c met receptor tyrosine kinase met and its biological pathway 
met is a promising target for cancer therapy  based on its multiple roles in cancerous cell proliferation  tumor spread  new blood vessel formation and resistance to certain drug therapies 
we and our partners  daiichi sankyo co  ltd 
daiichi sankyo and kyowa hakko kirin co  ltd 
kyowa hakko kirin  are implementing a clinical development program designed to realize the broad potential of tivantinib as a single agent and in combination with other anti cancer therapies in a number of disease indications 
our strategy is to focus on the most promising indications within our clinical programs based upon continually generated and updated data 
our most advanced indication is hepatocellular carcinoma hcc 
we are also completing earlier stage combination therapy trials with tivantinib and other anti cancer agents that may provide data to support later stage trials in additional indications 
on october   we and daiichi sankyo announced that the independent data monitoring committee dmc of the phase marquee m et inhibitor arq plus erlotinib vs 
erlotinib plus placebo in nsclc trial in non squamous cell nsclc recommended the study be discontinued early following a planned interim analysis  when they concluded that the study would not meet its primary endpoint of improved os 
although the interim analysis showed a statistically significant improvement in pfs in the intent to treat itt population  this benefit did not carry over to os 
there were no safety concerns identified by the dmc during this interim analysis 
marquee is a randomized  double blind  controlled pivotal trial conducted under an spa to evaluate tivantinib in combination with erlotinib  an approved anti cancer agent  in previously treated patients with locally advanced or metastatic  non squamous nsclc 
we and daiichi sankyo have provided information regarding the study discontinuation to health authorities and those clinical investigators participating in studies of tivantinib 
data from this study will be presented at an upcoming peer review forum 
our analysis of these data will inform our decisions regarding potential further development in nsclc or in certain biomarker defined sub groups within this disease population 
in nsclc  we are also conducting a phase  randomized trial of tivantinib and erlotinib in patients with a mutated form of the kras gene 
on october   we reported that we had been informed by kyowa hakko kirin that it will permanently suspend enrollment in its ongoing phase attention asian trial of tivantinib plus erlotinib for nsclc without egfr mutation trial following the recommendation of an independent safety review committee src in japan after the reporting of cases of interstitial lung disease ild in the study as a drug related adverse event 
it is our understanding that patients who were enrolled in the attention trial at the time of the safety finding can continue to receive treatment with the combination of tivantinib and erlotinib upon request from the patient and investigator and after providing new informed consent 
data from the trial are expected in late or early the attention trial is investigating the use of tivantinib and erlotinib versus erlotinib and placebo in second line non squamous nsclc patients with the wild type form of the egfr gene 
this trial is being conducted by kyowa hakko kirin in japan  south korea and taiwan 
on january   we announced the top line results of a randomized phase signal generation trial of tivantinib used in combination with irinotecan and cetuximab in patients with refractory or relapsed colorectal cancer crc 
the trial did not meet its primary endpoint of pfs  the pfs results obtained in both the control arm and the experimental arm were longer than expected compared to previously published historical norms 
additional data and analyses from this trial are planned for presentation at a future medical meeting and will include mature os data as well as analyses of patient sub groups  biomarker status and regional variability  including pre and post study treatments 
additional data and analyses from this trial are planned for presentation at a future medical meeting 
we have licensed commercial rights to tivantinib for human cancer indications to daiichi sankyo in the us  europe  south america and the rest of the world  excluding japan and certain other asian countries  where we have licensed commercial rights to kyowa hakko kirin 
our agreements with these partners provide for possible future milestone payments  royalties on product sales  and development funding  in addition to significant payments that we have already received 
during  we received million from daiichi sankyo resulting from the dosing of the first patient in the marquee trial  and we received million from kyowa hakko kirin resulting from dosing of the first patient in the attention trial 
the terms of our tivantinib licensing agreements with daiichi sankyo and kyowa hakko kirin remain in effect following the recent developments in both of these trials 
our other clinical stage products are directed toward molecular targets and biological processes with demonstrated roles in the development of human cancers 
the most advanced candidates in this pipeline are arq  an inhibitor of fibroblast growth factor receptor arq  an inhibitor of the eg kinesin motor protein  and arq  an inhibitor of the raf kinases  all of which are undergoing or have completed phase clinical testing 
our drug discovery efforts are focused primarily on the akip tm  which we are using to generate compounds designed to inhibit kinases without competing with adenosine triphosphate atp for binding to the target kinase  as well as other types of kinase inhibitors 
atp is a chemical found in all living cells and is the energy source involved in a variety of physiological processes 
we have assessed the potential of akip tm to target multiple kinases in oncology and other therapeutic areas  and we are generating and validating compounds that inhibit these kinase targets 
during  daiichi sankyo licensed arq  an inhibitor of the akt protein kinase discovered under our akip tm oncology drug discovery collaboration that terminated in november arq is the first clinical stage compound to emerge from this collaboration 
as a result of our license agreement for this compound  we received a million payment from daiichi sankyo in november we have incurred a cumulative deficit of approximately million from inception through december  we expect research and development costs to increase during the course of  due to clinical testing of our lead product candidates 
we recorded a net loss for  and and expect a net loss for our revenue consists primarily of development funding from our alliances with daiichi sankyo and kyowa hakko kirin 
revenue and expenses fluctuate from quarter to quarter based upon a number of factors  notably the timing and extent of our cancer related research and development activities together with the length and outcome of our clinical trials 
on december   we entered into a license  co development and co commercialization agreement with daiichi sankyo to conduct research  clinical trials and commercialization of tivantinib in human cancer indications 
the agreement provides for a million cash upfront licensing payment from daiichi sankyo to us  which we received in december  and an additional million in potential development and sales milestone payments offset by our share of the phase costs 
upon commercialization  we will receive tiered  double digit royalties from daiichi sankyo on net sales of tivantinib commensurate with the magnitude of the transaction 
we retain the option to participate in the commercialization of tivantinib in the us we and daiichi sankyo will share equally the costs of phase and phase clinical studies  with our share of phase costs payable solely from milestone and royalty payments by daiichi sankyo 
the dosing of the first patient in the phase marquee clinical trial of tivantinib in nsclc  announced in january  triggered the payment of a million development milestone from daiichi sankyo that was received in february revenue for this agreement is recognized using the contingency adjusted performance model 
through september   revenue was recognized based upon an estimated development period through december as a result of the october decision to discontinue the marquee trial  the development period as of october  was extended to june therefore  commencing with the fourth quarter of  revenue is recognized over this new development period 
under the previous estimated development period revenue for this agreement was expected to be approximately million in the fourth quarter of under the revised development period revenue for this agreement was million in the fourth quarter of resulting in a reduction of million 
under the terms of our tivantinib collaboration agreement with daiichi sankyo we share development costs equally with our share of phase costs funded solely from milestones and royalties 
in each quarter the tivantinib collaboration costs we incur are compared with those of daiichi sankyo 
if our costs for the quarter exceed daiichi sankyo s  we recognize revenue on the amounts due to us under the contingency adjusted performance model 
revenue is calculated on a pro rata basis using the time elapsed from inception of the agreement over the estimated duration of the development period under the agreement 
if our costs for the quarter are less than those of daiichi sankyo s  we report the amount due to daiichi sankyo as contra revenue in that quarter 
to the extent that our share of phase collaboration costs exceeds the amount of milestones and royalties received  that excess is netted against future milestones and royalties if and when earned and is not reported as contra revenue 
our cumulative share of the daiichi sankyo phase costs inception to date through december   totaled million and we received milestones of million during that period 
our cumulative share of phase collaboration costs has exceeded the amount of milestones received through december  by million which will be netted against future milestones and royalties  if any  when earned and has not been reported as contra revenue 
on january   we announced that the first patient had been enrolled in the pivotal phase metiv trial of tivantinib  entitling us to a million milestone 
we will not receive any net cash proceeds from this milestone as it will be netted against our cumulative share of phase collaboration costs in excess of milestones received of million at december  in  our phase tivantinib collaboration costs incurred were less than those of daiichi sankyo s by million which was recognized as contra revenue and netted against our tivantinib daiichi sankyo research and development revenue 
our non refundable share of advance drug purchases is recognized as contra revenue as the related drugs are administered to patients 
for the year ended december   million of these drug purchases was also recognized as contra revenue 
there were no advance drug purchases in the year ended december  in  our phase tivantinib collaboration costs incurred were less than those of daiichi sankyo s by million which was recognized as contra revenue and netted against our tivantinib daiichi sankyo research and development revenue 
our non refundable share of advance drug purchases in was million 
these costs are recognized as contra revenue as the related drugs are administered to patients 
for the year ended december  million of these drug purchases was also recognized as contra revenue 
in  our phase tivantinib collaboration costs incurred were less than those of daiichi sankyo s by million which was recognized as contra revenue and netted against our tivantinib daiichi sankyo research and development revenue 
there were no advance drug purchases in the year ended december  prepaid expenses and other current assets at december  included million of prepaid phase drug purchases 
this amount was recognized as contra revenue in the year ended december  as the drugs were administered to patients in the phase trial 
in november  we completed our research collaboration with daiichi sankyo under an agreement entered into in that was focused on applications of our proprietary akip tm technology and know how 
the agreement provides for a million upfront payment  which we received in november  research support payments for the first two years of the collaboration which was extended for an additional two years in  licensing fees for compounds discovered as a result of this research  milestone payments related to clinical development  regulatory review and sales  and royalty payments on net sales of compounds from the collaboration 
we retain the option to co commercialize licensed products developed under this agreement in the us in may  we entered into an agreement with daiichi sankyo related to potential future milestones and royalties for our akip tm collaboration  under which we could receive up to a total of million in upfront  potential development and sales milestone payments for each product selected for clinical development 
upon commercialization of a licensed product  we would also receive tiered  double digit royalties on its net sales 
revenue for this agreement was recognized using the contingency adjusted performance model with an estimated performance period through november in november  we and daiichi sankyo announced the execution of a license agreement for the development of arq  the first compound to emerge from the companies akip tm collaboration 
the license agreement provides exclusive rights to daiichi sankyo for the development  manufacturing and marketing of arq on a worldwide basis 
under this agreement  we received a million payment from daiichi sankyo in november on april   we entered into an exclusive license agreement with kyowa hakko kirin to develop and commercialize tivantinib in japan and parts of asia 
a million portion of an upfront licensing fee was received by the company under this agreement in the first quarter of  and an additional million in upfront licensing fees was received on may  the agreement includes million in upfront and potential development milestone payments from kyowa hakko kirin to arqule  including the million cash upfront licensing payments 
in february  we received a million milestone payment from kyowa hakko kirin  and in september  we received a million milestone payment 
upon commercialization  arqule will receive tiered royalties in the mid teen to low twenty percent range from kyowa hakko kirin on net sales of tivantinib 
kyowa hakko kirin will be responsible for all clinical development costs and commercialization of the compound in certain asian countries  consisting of japan  china including hong kong  south korea and taiwan 
in addition to the upfront and possible regulatory milestone payments totaling million  the company will be eligible for future milestone payments based on the achievement of certain levels of net sales 
the company will recognize the payments  if any  as revenue in accordance with its revenue recognition policies 
as of december   the company has not recognized any revenue from these sales milestone payments  and there can be no assurance that it will do so in the future 
revenue for this agreement is recognized using the contingency adjusted performance model with an estimated development period through april liquidity and capital resources december  increase decrease to to in millions cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities short term marketable securities long term notes payable working capital december  in millions cash flow from operating activities investing activities financing activities cash flow from operating activities 
our uses of cash for operating activities have primarily consisted of salaries and wages for our employees  facility and facility related costs for our offices and laboratories  fees paid in connection with preclinical and clinical studies  laboratory supplies and materials  and professional fees 
the sources of our cash flow from operating activities have consisted primarily of payments received from our collaborators for services performed or upfront payments for future services 
for the year ended december   our net use of cash of million was primarily driven by the difference between cash receipts from our collaborators and payments for operating expenses 
cash flow from investing activities 
our net cash used by investing activities of million in was primarily comprised of net purchases of marketable securities 
the composition and mix of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities may change frequently as a result of the company s constant evaluation of conditions in financial markets  the maturity of specific investments  and our near term liquidity needs 
our cash equivalents and marketable securities typically include us treasury bill funds  money market funds  commercial paper  and us federal and state agency backed certificates  including auction rate securities that have investment grade ratings 
our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
fixed rate interest securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
arqule s marketable securities portfolio includes million at cost at december  and  invested in auction rate securities 
beginning in the first quarter of and throughout  certain auction rate securities failed at auction due to sell orders exceeding buy orders 
on november   the company received a put option from ubs ag to repurchase auction rate securities owned by the company at par value at any time during the period from june  through july  the put option 
the company accounted for the put option as a freestanding financial instrument and elected to record the value under the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
on june   the company exercised the put option and in july  ubs ag redeemed at par value all million of the company s auction rate securities held by ubs ag that were outstanding at june  throughout ubs ag redeemed at par value a total of million of the company s auction rate securities held by ubs ag  including those redeemed from the exercise of the put option 
the company used a portion of the million of redemptions to retire the million notes payable to ubs ag that had been outstanding at december  the credit line at ubs ag was cancelled in july cash flow from financing activities 
our net cash provided by financing activities of million in the year ended december  consisted of million from the net proceeds of our april stock offering and additional cash inflow of million from the exercise of stock options and employee stock plan purchases 
our net cash provided by financing activities of million in the year ended december  consisted of million from the net proceeds of our january stock offering and additional cash inflow of million from the exercise of stock options and employee stock plan purchases 
our net cash used by financing activities of million in the year ended december  was from the million payment on our notes payable  partially offset by additional cash inflow of million from stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases 
our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending upon the results of our drug discovery and development strategies  our ability to enter into additional corporate collaborations and the terms of such collaborations  results of research and development  unanticipated required capital expenditures  competitive and technological advances  acquisitions and other factors 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to develop any of our drug candidates into a commercial product 
it is likely we will need to raise additional capital or incur indebtedness to continue to fund our operations in the future 
our ability to raise additional funds will depend on financial  economic and market conditions  and due to global capital and credit market conditions or for other reasons  we may be unable to raise capital when needed  or on terms favorable to us 
if necessary funds are not available  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate some of our development programs  potentially delaying the time to market for any of our product candidates 
in april  we received net proceeds of million from our  share stock offering 
in light of this cash inflow  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at december  and our collaboration agreements  we expect that our available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital requirements well into our contractual obligations were comprised of the following as of december  in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years note payable operating lease obligations purchase obligations total purchase obligations are comprised primarily of outsourced preclinical and clinical trial expenses and payments to license certain intellectual property to support the company s research efforts 
interest on notes payable is variable and is excluded from the table above 
notes payable currently bears interest at libor plus basis points 
under our tivantinib collaboration with daiichi sankyo  our share of phase costs are payable solely from future milestones and royalties 
as of december  our portion of these costs was million and is excluded from the table above 
these costs are netted against any future milestones and royalties due to us 
daiichi sankyo has the right to offset future milestone and royalty payments by this amount 
critical accounting policies and estimates a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management believes the following are critical accounting policies 
for additional information  please see the discussion of our significant accounting policies in note to the financial statements included in item of this form k 
research and development revenue research and development revenue is generated primarily through collaborative research and development agreements 
the terms of the agreements may include nonrefundable upfront payments  funding for research and development  milestone payments and royalties on any product sales derived from collaborations 
the company adopted the fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition milestone method on a prospective basis on january  the decision to use the milestone method of revenue recognition is a policy election 
the milestone method may impact any new collaboration agreements or material modifications to existing agreements  in the event we elect the policy of utilizing the milestone method to recognize substantive milestones 
research and development payments associated with our collaboration agreements in effect prior to january  are recognized as research and development revenue using the contingency adjusted performance model 
under this model  when payments are earned  revenue is immediately recognized on a pro rata basis in the period we achieve the milestone based on the time elapsed from inception of the agreement to the time the milestone is earned over the estimated duration of the development period under the agreement 
thereafter  the remaining portion of the milestone payment is recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining estimated development period under the agreement 
this estimated development period may ultimately be shorter or longer depending upon the outcome of the development work  resulting in accelerated or deferred recognition of the development revenue 
royalty payments will be recognized as revenue when earned 
the costs associated with satisfying research and development contracts are included in research and development expense as incurred 
for our tivantinib collaboration with daiichi sankyo  we compare the collaboration costs we incur with those of daiichi sankyo each quarter 
if our costs for the quarter exceed daiichi sankyo s we recognize revenue on the amounts due to us under the contingency adjusted performance model 
revenue is calculated on a pro rata basis using the time elapsed from inception of the agreement over the estimated duration of the development period under the agreement 
if our costs for the quarter are less than those of daiichi sankyo s  we report the amount due to daiichi sankyo as contra revenue in that quarter 
amounts recognized as contra revenue are netted against our tivantinib daiichi sankyo research and development revenue 
to the extent that our share of phase collaboration costs exceeds the amount of milestones and royalties received  that excess is netted against future milestones and royalties if and when earned and is not reported as contra revenue 
on november   we and daiichi sankyo announced the execution of a license agreement for the development of a new akt inhibitor  arq the license agreement provides exclusive rights to daiichi sankyo for the development  manufacturing and marketing of arq on a worldwide basis 
revenue for this agreement is recognized using financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards update no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu 
under asu all undelivered items under an agreement are divided into separate units of accounting based on whether the deliverable provides stand alone value to the licensee 
the company determines the best estimate selling price besp for each unit of accounting based upon management s judgment and including factors such as discounted cash flows  estimated direct expenses and other costs and probability of successful outcome of clinical trials 
stock based compensation our stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the calculated fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employees requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity grant 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes valuation model 
key input assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options include the exercise price of the award  expected option term  expected volatility of our stock over the option s expected term  risk free interest rate over the option s expected term  and the expected annual dividend yield 
we believe that the valuation technique and approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions are appropriate in calculating the fair values of our stock option grants 
cash equivalents and marketable securities we consider all highly liquid investments purchased within three months of original maturity date to be cash equivalents 
we invest our available cash primarily in us treasury bill funds  money market funds  commercial paper  and us federal and state agency backed certificates  including auction rate securities that have investment grade ratings 
auction rate securities are structured with short term interest reset dates of generally less than days  but with contractual maturities that can be well in excess of ten years 
at the end of each reset period  which occurs every seven to twenty eight days  investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par value 
our auction rate securities are classified as trading securities 
we generally classify our marketable securities as available for sale at the time of purchase and re evaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date 
the company classifies its investments as either current or long term based upon the investments contractual maturities and the company s ability and intent to convert such instruments to cash within one year 
we report available for sale investments at fair value as of each balance sheet date and include any unrealized gains and  to the extent deemed temporary  unrealized losses in stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method and are included in other income in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss 
certain of our marketable securities are classified as trading securities and any changes in the fair value of those securities are recorded as other income in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss 
we conduct quarterly reviews to determine the fair value of our investment portfolio and to identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized loss  in accordance with the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
an unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis 
in the event that the cost basis of a security exceeds its fair value  we evaluate  among other factors  the duration of the period that  and extent to which  the fair value is less than cost basis  the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer  including industry and sector performance  and operational and financing cash flow factors  overall market conditions and trends  our intent to sell the investment and if it is more likely than not that we would be required to sell the investment before its anticipated recovery 
unrealized losses on available for sale securities that are determined to be temporary  and not related to credit loss  are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
for available for sale debt securities with unrealized losses  we perform an analysis to assess whether we intend to sell or whether we would more likely than not be required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis 
where we intend to sell a security  or may be required to do so  the security s decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary and the full amount of the unrealized loss is reflected in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss as an impairment loss 
regardless of our intent to sell a security  we perform additional analysis on all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate losses associated with the creditworthiness of the security 
credit losses are identified where we do not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of a security 
results of operations the following are the results of operations for the years ended december   and revenue increase decrease to to in millions research and development revenue as compared to research and development revenue in was comprised of revenue from the daiichi sankyo development and research collaboration agreements entered into in  the november license agreement with daiichi sankyo for the development of arq  and the kyowa hakko kirin exclusive license agreement 
under the terms of our tivantinib collaboration agreement with daiichi sankyo we share development costs equally with our share of phase costs funded solely from milestones and royalties 
in each quarter the tivantinib collaboration costs that we incur are compared with those of daiichi sankyo 
if our costs for the quarter exceed daiichi sankyo s  we recognize revenue on the amounts due to us under the contingency adjusted performance model 
revenue is calculated on a pro rata basis using the time elapsed from inception of the agreement over the estimated duration of the development period under the agreement 
if our costs for the quarter are less than those of daiichi sankyo s  we report the amount due to daiichi sankyo as contra revenue in that quarter 
to the extent that our share of phase collaboration costs exceeds the amount of milestones and royalties received  that excess is netted against future milestones and royalties if and when earned and is not reported as contra revenue 
our cumulative share of the daiichi sankyo phase costs inception to date through december   totaled million and we received milestones of million during that period 
our cumulative share of phase collaboration costs has exceeded the amount of milestones received through december  by million which will be netted against future milestones and royalties  if any  when earned and has not been reported as contra revenue 
on january   we announced that the first patient had been enrolled in the pivotal phase metiv trial of tivantinib  entitling us to a million milestone 
we will not receive any net cash proceeds from this milestone as it will be netted against our cumulative share of phase collaboration costs in excess of milestones received of million at december  in  our tivantinib collaboration costs incurred were less than those of daiichi sankyo s by million which was recognized as contra revenue and netted against our tivantinib daiichi sankyo research and development revenue 
our non refundable share of advance drug purchases is recognized as contra revenue as the related drugs are administered to patients 
for the year ended december  million of these drug purchases was also recognized as contra revenue 
there were no advance drug purchases in the year ended december  the million revenue decrease in was principally due to a million decrease in revenue recognized from daiichi sankyo arq milestone we received in  a million decrease in revenue recognized from the license agreement with kyowa hakko kirin  a million decrease in revenue recognized on the milestone we received from the daiichi sankyo tivantinib program in  a million revenue decrease from our daiichi sankyo akip tm agreement  and a million decrease in revenue resulting from the extension of the development period of our daiichi sankyo tivantinib agreement 
these revenue decreases were partially offset by a million increase from our daiichi sankyo arq agreement and lower contra revenue of million associated with our daiichi sankyo tivantinib program 
as compared to research and development revenue in was comprised of revenue from the daiichi sankyo development and research collaboration agreements entered into in  the november license agreement with daiichi sankyo for the development of arq  and the kyowa hakko kirin exclusive license agreement 
in  our tivantinib collaboration costs incurred were less than those of daiichi sankyo s by million which was recognized as contra revenue and netted against our tivantinib daiichi sankyo research and development revenue 
our non refundable share of advance drug purchases in was million 
these costs are recognized as contra revenue as the related drugs are administered to patients 
for the year ended december  million of these drug purchases was also recognized as contra revenue 
our cumulative share of the daiichi sankyo phase costs inception to date through december   totaled million and we received milestones of million during that period 
our cumulative share of phase collaboration costs has exceeded the amount of milestones received through december  by million which will be netted against future milestones and royalties when earned and has not been reported as contra revenue 
prepaid expenses and other current assets at december  included million of prepaid phase drug purchases which was recognized as contra revenue in as the drugs were administered to patients in the phase trial 
in  our tivantinib collaboration costs incurred were less than those of daiichi sankyo s by million which was recognized as contra revenue and netted against our tivantinib daiichi sankyo research and development revenue 
there were no advance drug purchases in the year ended december  the increase in revenues in was due to an increase in revenues of million from our license agreement with kyowa hakko kirin  million from our daiichi sankyo akip tm program and million from our november license agreement with daiichi sankyo for the development of arq offsetting these increases was a net decrease of million in revenue from our daiichi sankyo tivantinib program 
although revenue for that program increased by million in  the amount of contra revenue increased by million as our share of development costs associated with the marquee trial increased 
research and development increase decrease to to in millions research and development as compared to the million decrease in research and development expense in was primarily due to an million decrease in outsourced clinical and product development costs related to our phase and programs for tivantinib and pipeline programs 
other cost decreases include million labor related costs from reduced headcount  million for lab expenses  and million for professional fees 
at december   we had employees dedicated to our research and development program  down from employees at december  as compared to the million decrease in research and development expense in was primarily due to a million decrease in outsourced clinical and product development costs related to our phase and programs for tivantinib 
at december   we had employees dedicated to our research and development program  down from employees at december  overview our research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  costs of contract manufacturing services  costs of facilities and equipment  fees paid to professional service providers in conjunction with our clinical trials  fees paid to research organizations in conjunction with pre clinical animal studies  costs of materials used in research and development  consulting  license  and sponsored research fees paid to third parties and depreciation of associated laboratory equipment 
we expect our research and development expense to increase as we continue to develop our portfolio of oncology programs 
we have not accumulated and tracked our internal historical research and development costs or our personnel and personnel related costs on a program by program basis 
our employee and infrastructure resources are allocated across several projects  and many of our costs are directed to broadly applicable research endeavors 
as a result  we cannot state the costs incurred for each of our oncology programs on a program by program basis 
the expenses incurred by us to third parties for pre clinical and clinical trials in the current year and since inception of our lead clinical stage program were as follows in millions oncology program current status year ended december  program to date c met program tivantinib phase our future research and development expenses in support of our current and future oncology programs will be subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion 
we test potential products in numerous pre clinical studies for safety  toxicology  and efficacy 
we may conduct multiple clinical trials for each product 
as we obtain results from trials  we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain products in order to focus our resources on more promising products 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  and the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty  and intended use of a product 
it is not unusual for the pre clinical and clinical development of each of these types of products to take nine years or more  and for total development costs to exceed million for each product 
we estimate that clinical trials of the type generally needed to secure new drug approval are typically completed over the following timelines clinical phase estimated completion period phase years phase years phase years the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during clinical development  including  among others  the following the number of clinical sites included in the trials  the length of time required to enroll suitable patients  the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trials  the duration of patient follow up to ensure the absence of long term product related adverse events  and the efficacy and safety profile of the product 
an element of our business strategy is to pursue the research and development of a broad pipeline of products 
this is intended to allow us to diversify the risks associated with our research and development expenditures 
as a result  we believe our future capital requirements and future financial success do not substantially depend on any one product 
to the extent we are unable to build and maintain a broad pipeline of products  our dependence on the success of one or a few products increases 
our strategy includes entering into alliance arrangements with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of our products  such as our collaboration agreements with daiichi sankyo and kyowa hakko kirin 
in the event that third parties have control over the clinical trial process for a product  the estimated completion date would be under control of that third party rather than under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether our products will be subject to future collaborative arrangements or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we make significant estimates in determining the duration and completion costs of our oncology programs or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product 
our inability to complete our oncology programs in a timely manner or our failure to enter into appropriate collaborative agreements could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity 
these uncertainties could force us to seek additional  external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our product development strategy 
our inability to raise additional capital  or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us  would jeopardize the future success of our business

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risk as part of our investment portfolio 
we have implemented policies regarding the amount and credit ratings of investments 
our investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is used to fund operations  including our research and development activities 
our investments are evaluated quarterly to determine the fair value of the portfolio 
our cash and marketable securities typically include us treasury bill funds  money market funds  commercial paper and us federal and state agency backed certificates  including auction rate securities that have strong credit ratings 
our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
fixed rate interest securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
auction rate securities are structured with short term interest reset dates of generally less than days  but with contractual maturities that can be well in excess of ten years 
at the end of each reset period  which occurs every seven to twenty eight days  investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par value 
if auction rate securities fail an auction  due to sell orders exceeding buy orders  the funds associated with a failed auction would not be accessible until a successful auction occurred  a buyer was found outside the auction process  the underlying securities matured or a settlement with the underwriter is reached 
beginning in the first quarter of and throughout  certain auction rate securities failed at auction due to sell orders exceeding buy orders 
at december  we held million of auction rate securities at fair value
