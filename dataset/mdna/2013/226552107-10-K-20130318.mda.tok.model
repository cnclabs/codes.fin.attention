overview we are a hosted services company that provides web hosting  hosted telecommunications services  search engine optimization management  link building  e commerce software  website development  and broadband internet services for businesses and entrepreneurs 
our services are designed to make enterprise class hosting services available to small and medium sized businesses at affordable monthly rates 
the company has three operating segments  which consist of storesonline  crexendo web services  and crexendo network services 
storesonline segment our storesonline segment serves the small office home office soho business owner and entrepreneur seeking the tools and training to establish a successful website on the internet 
specifically  storesonline services a market segment looking for a do it yourself option as an alternative to the high cost of contracting an e commerce or lead generation web developer and  most importantly  an ad agency for website promotion 
both are difficult barriers to many entrepreneurs looking to establish a presence on the internet 
we have historically sold our storesonline products and services through a direct mail seminar format utilizing direct response marketing campaigns 
in july  we suspended the sale of our products and services through the direct mail seminar format 
following the suspension the direct mail seminar format  our primary marketing channel for our storesonline segment has been through in house telemarketing  online marketing channels  and direct prospecting 
storesonline revenue continues to decline as the collections of epta revenue reduces over time as customer complete their obligations  as typical contract terms were months 
with the suspension of our direct mail seminar sales channel  we are no longer replacing the backlog 
we continue to generate revenue from web hosting services and the sale of avail crexendo web services segment we provide professional services such as search engine optimization management services  link building  paid search management services  conversion rate optimization services  and website design and development 
our web services revenue increased or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  as of december  and  our backlog was million  respectively 
crexendo network services segment our hosted telecommunications services transmit calls using voip technology  which converts voice signals into digital data packets for transmission over the internet 
each of our calling plans provides a number of basic features typically offered by traditional telephone service providers  plus a wide range of enhanced features that we believe offer an attractive value proposition to our customers 
this platform enables a user via a single identity to access and utilize services and features regardless of how the user is connected to the internet  whether it be from a desktop device or a mobile device 
in january  our direct sales representatives began selling our hosted telecommunications products and services 
we have experienced significant growth in our network services revenue quarter over quarter 
revenues recognized during the three months ended march   june   september  and december  were    and  respectively 
in june  we began selling broadband internet connection services and during the year ended december   the company generated approximately  in revenue from these services 
as of december   our backlog is  as compared to  at december  backlog represents contracts signed with no service or payment provided at december  restructuring and other charges in july  we initiated plans to restructure and reduce costs in our operations as a result of the continued lack of profitability and other challenges in our seminar sales channel for our storesonline segment 
restructurings began in the third quarter of in an effort to better position our company for long term growth  future profitability  greater competitiveness and improved efficiency across our business 
actions taken in connection with our restructuring plan include the suspension of our direct mail marketing campaigns and sales of our products and services through our storesonline seminar channel  refinement of our product portfolio focused towards recurring subscription based products and services  and redeployment of our sales and marketing resources in an effort to increase our direct sales  inside sales  and online sales channels 
through these initiatives we incurred aggregate pre tax restructuring charges and transition expenses of approximately  during the year ended december   of which approximately  was recorded for inventory write downs  unused direct response advertising  and intangible asset impairment 
the remaining amount relates to the abandonment of an operating lease agreement 
there were no restructuring expenses for the year ended december  critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and necessarily included certain estimates and judgments made by management 
the following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows and that may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition in general  we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product or service has been provided to the customer  the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable  and the collection of our fees is probable 
we recognize revenue from our web services and network services segments on an accrual basis and revenue from our storesonline segment on a cash basis 
specifics to revenue category are as follows software licenses and dvd training courses sold under eptas are recognized as revenue upon receipt of cash from customers and not at the time of sale 
accounting guidance requires revenue to be deferred until customer payments are received as collection of the original principal balance is deemed not probable based on historical collection rates 
we enter into agreements where revenue is derived from multiple deliverables including any mix of products and or services 
for these arrangements  we determine whether the delivered item s has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  and in the event the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item s  whether the delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
if these criteria are met  the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on each unit s relative selling price 
if these criteria are not met  the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting which would result in revenue being recognized ratably over the contract term or deferred until the earlier of when such criteria are met or when the last undelivered element is delivered 
the amount of product and services revenue recognized for arrangements with multiple deliverables is impacted by the allocation of arrangement consideration to the deliverables in the arrangement based on the relative selling prices 
in determining our selling prices  we apply the selling price hierarchy using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe when available  third party evidence of selling price tpe if vsoe does not exist  and best estimated selling price besp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
we are typically not able to determine vsoe on our products and services 
vsoe of fair value for elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for a deliverable when sold separately 
we are typically not able to determine tpe for our products or services 
tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately 
generally  our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality is difficult to obtain 
furthermore  we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products selling prices are on a stand alone basis 
when we are unable to establish the selling price using vsoe or tpe  we use besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand alone basis 
we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  cost of products  gross margin objectives  pricing practices  geographies  customer classes and distribution channels 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when we determine there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 
changes in the allocation of the sales price between delivered and undelivered elements can impact the timing of revenue recognized but does not change the total revenue recognized on any agreement 
professional services revenue fees collected for professional services  including website design and development  search engine optimization services  link building  paid search management services  and telecom installation services are recognized as revenue  net of expected customer refunds  over the period during which the services are performed  based upon the value for such services 
web and telecommunications services hosting revenue fees collected for hosting revenue are recognized ratably as services are provided 
customers are billed for these services on a monthly or annual basis at the customer s option 
we recognize revenue ratably over the applicable service period 
when we provide a free trial period  we do not begin to recognize subscription revenue until the trial period has ended and the customer has been billed for the services 
equipment sales and financing revenue fees generated from the sale of telecommunications equipment are recognized when the devices are installed and hosted telecommunications services begin 
fees generated from renting our hosted telecommunication equipment voip telephone devices through leasing contracts are recognized as revenue based on whether the lease qualifies as an operating lease or sales type lease 
the two primary accounting provisions which we use to classify transactions as sales type or operating leases are lease term to determine if it is equal to or greater than of the economic life of the equipment and the present value of the minimum lease payments to determine if they are equal to or greater than of the fair market value of the equipment at the inception of the lease 
the economic life of most of our products is estimated to be three years  since this represents the most frequent contractual lease term for our products  and there is generally no residual value for used equipment 
residual values  if any  are established at the lease inception using estimates of fair value at the end of the lease term 
the vast majority of our leases that qualify as sales type leases are non cancelable and include cancellation penalties approximately equal to the full value of the lease receivables 
leases that do not meet the criteria for sales type lease accounting are accounted for as operating leases 
revenue from sales type leases is recognized upon installation and the interest portion is deferred and recognized as earned 
revenue from operating leases in recognized ratably over the applicable service period 
commission revenue we have contracts with third party entities with respect to telemarketing product sales to our customers following the sale of the initial software licenses 
these products and services are intended to assist the customers with their internet businesses 
these products are sold and delivered completely by third parties 
we receive commissions from these third parties  and recognize the revenue as the commissions are received  net of expected customer refunds 
avail in january we changed the contract that is associated with the sale of our avail subscription 
effective march  any customer that has not activated their avail subscription was assessed an activation fee of an additional 
prior to this change in contract  this activation fee was included in a bundle of items sold at the workshop and there was no time limit on activation 
all existing customers were notified of the change in contract in january and were given days to activate avail without paying the additional activation fee 
as a result of this change in contract  we recognized approximately  in revenue upon expiration of the day notice during march for the avail activation fees described above as we no longer had an obligation to provide the activation 
allowance for doubtful accounts for epta contracts for sales made through epta contracts  we record an allowance for doubtful accounts at the time the epta contract is executed 
the allowance represents estimated losses resulting from customers failure to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts for eptas is netted against the current and long term trade receivables balances 
the allowance estimate is based on historical collection experience  specific identification of probable bad debts based on collection efforts  aging of trade receivables  customer payment history  and other known factors  including current economic conditions 
we believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate based on our assessment to date  however  actual collection results may differ materially from our expectations 
because revenue generated from customers financing through eptas is deferred and not recognized prior to the collection of cash  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts related to our epta contracts increase or decrease deferred revenue 
trade receivables are written off against the allowance when the related customers are no longer making required payments and the trade receivables are determined to be uncollectible  typically days past their original due date 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts for web and network services trade account receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not include interest 
we record an allowance as a reduction of our accounts receivable balance 
estimates are used in determining these reserves 
we calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts using specific identification 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers 
if such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for current services provided  any future services provided to that customer will result in the deferral of revenue until payment is made or we determine payment is reasonably assured 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating current income tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
our deferred income tax assets consist primarily of the future benefit of net operating loss carry forwards  certain deferred revenue  accrued expenses and tax credit carry forwards 
we may recognize the tax benefits from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
accounting guidance is also provided on de recognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  and income tax disclosures 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we evaluate all significant available positive and negative evidence  including historical operating results  estimates of future taxable income and the existence of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
stock based compensation we account for our share based compensation awards using the fair value method 
the grant date fair value was determined using the black scholes merton pricing model 
the black scholes merton valuation calculation requires us to make key assumptions such as future stock price volatility  expected terms  risk free rates  and dividend yield 
our expected volatility is derived from our volatility rate as a publicly traded company 
the risk free interest factor is based on the united states treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant for zero coupon united states treasury notes with maturities of approximately equal to each grant s expected term 
we develop an estimate of the number of share based awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover 
annual changes in the estimated forfeiture rate may have a significant effect on share based payments expense  as the effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment is made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate  which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements 
if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment is made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate  which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements 
we will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected term  volatility  and forfeiture rate related to our own share based awards on a prospective basis  and in incorporating these factors into the model 
if our actual experience differs significantly from the assumptions used to compute our share based compensation cost  or if different assumptions had been used  we may have recorded too much or too little share based compensation cost 
results of operations results of consolidated operations the following discussion of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report 
results of consolidated operations in thousands  except for per share amounts year ended december  consolidated operations revenue loss before income taxes income tax benefit provision net loss basic diluted net loss per share year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue revenue decreased or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in primarily due to the suspension of our direct mail seminars in july  a decrease in our principal collected on our accounts receivable balance  and a decrease in commissions from third parties and other revenue

segment operating results the company has three operating segments  which consist of storesonline  crexendo web services and crexendo network services 
effective october   the company changed its reporting segments to reflect the allocation of previously unallocated corporate expenses to each of the three operating segments 
the company revised its segment reporting to reflect changes in how the chief operating decision maker codm internally measures performance and allocates resources 
segment operating results for prior year have been modified to conform to current year segment operating results presentations 
the information below is organized in accordance with our three reportable segments 
segment operating income loss is equal to segment net revenue less segment cost of revenue  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses 
operating results of our storesonline segment in thousands year ended december  storesonline revenue operating expenses cost of revenue research and development selling and marketing general and administrative operating income other income income before tax provision year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue storesonline segment revenue decreased or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  following our decision to suspend our direct mail seminar sales in july  revenue from our storesonline segment has been generated primarily through principal amounts collected on historical sales of storesonline products and services sold through eptas 
fees for our storesonline products and services sold under eptas are recognized as revenue as cash payments are received from the customer and not at the time of sale 
revenue related to cash collected under epta agreements decreased or  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  our typical epta agreement has a term of two to three years 
although we no longer offer eptas to our customers as a result of the suspension of our direct mail seminar sales  we will continue to recognize revenue from those epta contracts executed prior to july as cash is collected from those contracts 
eptas are recognized in our balance sheet  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts  and offset by our deferred revenue balance 
the remaining deferred revenue balance is expected to be recognized as revenue  however  at a decreasing rate over the next year to eighteen months 
the following table summarizes the activity within deferred revenue for the year ended december  and in thousands storesonline deferred revenue as of january  cash collected on prinicpal of epta contracts less writeoffs storesonline deferred revenue as of december  storesonline deferred revenue as of january  cash collected on principal of epta contracts deferred revenue added during period net of writeoffs storesonline deferred revenue as of december  due to the suspension of our direct mail seminar sales channel in july  we had no cash sales of storesonline software licenses sos licenses or other products at events during the year ended december  compared to  during the year ended december  hosting revenue decreased to  in the year ended december  compared to  in the year ended december  the decrease in hosting revenue was primarily due to attrition in the storesonline customer base since july  primarily as a result of the suspension of the direct mail seminar sales channel 
commissions from third parties and other revenue decreased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december   due primarily to the suspension our direct mail seminar sales channel 
as a result of this decision  we no longer sent leads to third parties  and as such  we do not expect this revenue source to be significant in the future 
cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost to conduct internet training workshops  credit card fees  and the cost of products sold 
cost of revenue decreased or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue decreased to in the current year compared to in prior year 
the decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the suspension of direct mail seminars in july  and thereby not incurring the costs of seminars and internet training workshops during  but still receiving revenue from principal collected on epta contracts 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for sales and marketing activities  advertising  and promotional and public relations expenses 
selling and marketing expenses decreased or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue decreased to in the current year from in prior year 
the decrease in total selling and marketing expenses as well as selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue are primarily due to the suspension of direct mail seminars in july  which resulted in a more significant reduction in selling and marketing expenses than the reduction in revenue as a result of the continuation of revenue received on the collection of principal on epta contracts 
the selling and marketing expenses associated getting attendees to the seminars were a significant part of historical selling and marketing expenses 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for executive  accounting and administrative personnel  legal  accounting and other professionals  finance company service fees  and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to a reduction in payroll and related expenses  accounting fees  legal  and servicing fees on our epta contracts 
as of december   the company had employees in customer support  and in finance  legal and business development  collections  purchasing and other general administration 
however  as of december   the company had employees in customer support  and in finance  legal and business development  collections  purchasing and other general administration 
research and development research and development expenses primarily consist of payroll and related expenses  related to the development of new products and services for storesonline customers 
research and development expenses decreased or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in our engineering head count dedicated to this segment 
as of december   the company had employees in engineering and it support 
however  as of december   the company had employees in engineering and it support 
in addition to the overall reduction in headcount  more focus was placed on the development and improvement to our hosted telecommunications products and services during other income other income primarily relates to epta contracts  which generally carry an simple interest rate 
other income decreased or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to the decrease in outstanding epta receivables as cash is collected and uncollectable accounts are written off 
operating results of crexendo web services segment in thousands year ended december  crexendo web services revenue operating expenses cost of revenue research and development selling and marketing general and administrative operating loss other income loss before tax provision year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue crexendo web services segment revenue increased or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in revenue from the prior year is primarily due to an increase in direct sales representatives  which increased from an average of direct sales representatives for the year ended december  to an average of sales representatives for the year ended december  revenue from crexendo web services is generated primarily through search engine optimization services  link building  paid search management services  conversion rate optimization services  and website design and development services 
a substantial portion of crexendo web services revenue is generated through six to twelve month service contracts 
as such  crexendo web services revenues will initially be seen through fulfillment of our backlog 
below is a table which displays the crexendo web services revenue backlog as of december  and  which is expected to be recognized as revenue within the next twelve months in thousands crexendo web services backlog as of december  crexendo web services backlog as of december  cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of salaries and outsourcing fees related to fulfillment of our web services 
cost of revenue increased or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  as well as advertising expenses 
selling and marketing expense decreased or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in sales representatives and other marketing activity solely focused on crexendo web services sales with the increased focus on selling hosted telecommunications products and services starting in january general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist of payroll and related expenses for administrative personnel 
general and administrative expenses increased or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were higher than the year ended december   primarily due to an increased allocation of previously unallocated corporate expenses being allocated at a higher rate 
as storesonline revenue decreased significantly for the year ended december  compared to  we allocated less of the general and administrative expenses to the storesonline segment and more expenses to the crexendo web services and crexendo network services segments 
research and development research and development expenses primarily consist of payroll and related expenses  related to the development of new products and services for crexendo web services customers 
research and development expenses decreased or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in our engineering head count dedicated to this segment

in january our direct sales representatives began selling our crexendo network services products and services 
a substantial portion of crexendo network services segment revenue is generated through to month service contracts 
as such  we believe growth in crexendo network services segment will initially be seen through increases in our backlog 
backlog represents contracts signed with no service or payment provided at december  crexendo network services backlog as of december  crexendo network services backlog as of december  cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of product cost and customer support 
cost of revenue increased or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  cost of revenue is primarily made up of telecommunications equipment costs as well as customer service costs 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of direct sales representative salaries and benefits and the production of marketing materials 
selling and marketing expenses increased or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the allocation of sales representative s salary and benefit expenses as the sales representatives began selling crexendo network services products and services in january  and other marketing activity focused on crexendo network services sales 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for rent  professional fees  and administrative personnel 
general and administrative expenses increased or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were higher than the year ended december   primarily due to an increased allocation of previously unallocated corporate expenses being allocated at a higher rate 
as storesonline revenue decreased significantly for the year ended december  compared to  we allocated less of the general and administrative expenses to the storesonline segment and more expenses to the crexendo web services and crexendo network services segments 
research and development research and development expenses primarily consist of payroll and related expenses  related to the development of new telecom products 
research and development expenses increased or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in our engineering head count as we continued to expand our product development and offerings to meet market demand 
liquidity and capital resources in july  we announced the suspension of our direct mail seminar sales channel in our storesonline segment 
accordingly  we have shifted our focus toward growing our crexendo web services and network services segments 
as a result  the company has transformed into a start up company with the inherent risks and uncertainties of funding operations until profitability is achieved 
we currently plan to fund our growth through operating cash flows and available cash and cash equivalents reserves of  at december  the company s forecast indicates that given current trends and growth projections  the company at some future date may need to raise additional capital 
there can be no assurances that such additional capital  if needed  would be available on acceptable terms or at all  which would adversely affect our company s ability to achieve our business objectives 
due to changes in our growth strategy and the rapidly evolving nature of our business and the markets we serve  we believe period to period comparisons of our operating results  including operating expenses as a percentage of revenue and cash flows  are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
see note subsequent to december   the company received a letter from the ceo  and majority shareholder  that if there is a shortfall in cash  that the ceo would provide additional financial support if necessary up to million 
working capital decreased or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  working capital  excluding deferred revenue  decreased or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  deferred revenue balances represent historical sales for which we cannot immediately recognize revenue and will continue to decrease as cash is collected on epta contracts 
the costs and expenses we incur as these deferred revenue amounts are recognized as revenue will be insignificant 
consequently  we do not consider deferred revenue to be a factor that impacts our liquidity or future cash requirements 
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents decreased or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we used cash flows for operating activities of  compared to using cash flows for operating activities of  for the year ended december  trade receivables trade receivables and long term trade receivables  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  decreased or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  long term trade receivables  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  decreased or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  we offered our customers an installment contract with payment terms between and months  as one of several payment options 
the payments that become due more than months after the end of the fiscal period are classified as long term trade receivables 
trade receivables will continue to decline as cash is collected on epta contracts 
accounts payable accounts payable decreased or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the aging of accounts payable as of december  and was generally within our vendors terms of payment 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than to year years in thousands operating leases billing software payments are included in the period in which they are contractually required to be made

capital stockholders equity decreased or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease for the year ended december  in total stockholders equity was attributable to net loss of  and the declaration of  in dividends to common stockholders offset by an increase in additional paid in capital of  for options granted  and  for proceeds from stock options exercised 
common stock repurchase program on september   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  of our common stock

we did not repurchase shares of our common stock during the year ended december  we may suspend or discontinue purchasing the common stock at any time 
the repurchased common stock was retired 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases 
we do not believe that these operating leases are material to our current or future financial position  results of operations  revenues or expenses  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued asu in connection with testing goodwill for impairment 
the objective of this asu is intended to simplify goodwill impairment testing by adding a qualitative review step to assess whether the required quantitative impairment analysis that exists today is necessary 
the asu permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if it is concluded that this is the case  it is necessary to perform the currently prescribed two step goodwill impairment test 
otherwise  the two step goodwill impairment test is not required
