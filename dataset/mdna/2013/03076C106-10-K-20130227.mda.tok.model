we are in a strong position to capitalize on significant demographic and market trends driving increased demand for financial advice and solutions 
in the us  the ongoing transition of baby boomers into retirement  as well as recent economic and financial market crises  continues to drive demand for financial advice and solutions 
in addition  the amount of investable assets held by mass affluent and affluent households  our target market  have grown and accounts for over half of us investable assets 
we believe our differentiated financial planning model  broad range of products and solutions  as well as our demonstrated financial strength in the face of persistent economic headwinds  will help us capitalize on these trends 
our asset management capabilities are global in scale  with columbia management investment advisers  llc columbia or columbia management as the primary provider of us products and services and threadneedle asset management holdings s rl threadneedle as the primary provider of products and services outside of the us we offer a broad spectrum of investment advice and products to individual  institutional and high net worth investors 
these investment products are primarily provided through third parties  though we also provide our asset management products through our advisor channel

we are positioned to continue to grow our assets under management and to strengthen our asset management offerings to existing and new clients 
our asset management capabilities are well positioned to address mature markets in the us and europe 
we also have the capability to leverage existing strengths to effectively expand into new global and emerging markets  to which investors are increasingly looking as a source of growth and income 
in the past few years  we have 
table of contents expanded beyond our traditional strengths in the us and us to gather assets in continental europe  asia  australia  the middle east and africa 
in addition  we expect to leverage the collective investment and distribution capabilities of columbia and threadneedle to develop new solutions designed to manage an increasingly complex and volatile marketplace 
the financial results from the businesses underlying our go to market approaches are reflected in our five operating segments advice wealth management  asset management  annuities  protection  and corporate other 
our operating segments are aligned with the financial solutions we offer to address our clients needs 
the products and services we provide retail clients and  to a lesser extent  institutional clients  are the primary source of our revenues and net income 
revenues and net income are significantly affected by investment performance and the total value and composition of assets we manage and administer for our retail and institutional clients as well as the distribution fees we receive from other companies 
these factors  in turn  are largely determined by overall investment market performance and the depth and breadth of our individual client relationships 
financial markets and macroeconomic conditions have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our operating and performance results 
the persistent economic headwinds of the past several years have mitigated growth opportunities in our industry by affecting asset values and dampening client confidence and activity 
in addition  the business and regulatory environment in which we operate remains subject to elevated uncertainty and change 
to succeed  we expect to continue focusing on our key strategic objectives 
the success of these and other strategies may be affected by the factors discussed in item a of this annual report on form k risk factors 
equity price  credit market and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations  primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset based fees we earn  the spread income generated on our annuities  deposit products and universal life ul insurance products  the value of dac and deferred sales inducement costs dsic assets  the values of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the values of derivatives held to hedge these benefits 
earnings  as well as operating earnings  will continue to be negatively impacted by the ongoing low interest rate environment 
in addition to continuing spread compression in our interest sensitive product lines  there is also the potential for interest rate related impacts to dac and dsic amortization and the level of reserves as a result of our ongoing review of various actuarial related assumptions  which could be material 
in january  we completed the conversion of our federal savings bank subsidiary  ameriprise bank  fsb ameriprise bank  to a limited powers national trust bank 
in connection with this conversion  deposit taking and credit originating activities of ameriprise bank were terminated 
in addition  ameriprise financial was deregistered by the federal reserve as a savings and loan holding company and will no longer be subject to supervision and regulation as such 
we will continue to make available to our clients certain deposit and credit products via referral arrangements with respected third party financial institutions 
we incurred million of restructuring charges in related to exiting the banking business  of which million related to the impact of an interest rate hedge 
the transition released approximately million of formerly required capital  which we anticipate using to repurchase shares throughout we estimate that the transition will reduce our annual earnings by approximately million in at the enterprise level  we anticipate that the earnings per share impact will be neutralized by the end of  as we redeploy the excess capital to shareholders through share repurchases 
in the third quarter of the year  we conduct our annual review of insurance and annuity valuation assumptions relative to current experience and management expectations 
to the extent that expectations change as a result of this review  we update valuation assumptions and the impact is reflected as part of our annual review of life insurance and annuity valuation assumptions and modeling changes unlocking 
the unlocking impact in the third quarter of primarily reflected the low interest rate environment and the assumption of continued low interest rates over the near term 
specifically  the starting year treasury rate assumption used in modeling was reduced by basis points and we assumed rates would stay flat until mid  then increasing to their ultimate rate by mid we did not change our ultimate long term assumption 
see our consolidated and segment results of operations sections below for the pretax impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking and additional discussion of the drivers of the unlocking impact 

table of contents we consolidate certain collateralized debt obligations cdos and other investment products collectively  investment entities for which we provide asset management services to and sponsor for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business 
these entities are defined as consolidated investment entities cies

the net income loss of the cies is reflected in net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 
the results of operations of the cies are reflected in the corporate other segment 
on a consolidated basis  the management fees we earn for the services we provide to the cies and the related general and administrative expenses are eliminated and the changes in the assets and liabilities related to the cies  primarily debt and underlying syndicated loans  are reflected in net investment income 
we continue to include the fees in the management and financial advice fees line within our asset management segment 
while our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  management believes that operating measures  which exclude net realized gains or losses  the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits  net of hedges and the related dsic and dac amortization  integration and restructuring charges  income loss from discontinued operations  and the impact of consolidating cies  best reflect the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis 
while the consolidation of the cies impacts our balance sheet and income statement  our exposure to these entities is unchanged and there is no impact to the underlying business results 
management uses certain of these non gaap measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors 
also  certain of these non gaap measures are taken into consideration  to varying degrees  for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation related matters 
throughout our management discussion and analysis  these non gaap measures are referred to as operating measures 
it is management priority to increase shareholder value over a multi year horizon by achieving our on average  over time financial targets

critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies that we use affect our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting and reporting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and  in some cases  the application of these policies can be significantly affected by the estimates  judgments and assumptions made by management during the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the accounting and reporting policies we have identified as fundamental to a full understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition are described below 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information about our accounting policies 
valuation of investments the most significant component of our investments is our available for sale securities  which we carry at fair value within our consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  was primarily 
table of contents obtained from third party pricing sources 
we record unrealized securities gains losses in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of impacts to dac  dsic  certain benefit reserves and income taxes 
we recognize gains and losses in results of operations upon disposition of the securities 
when the fair value of an investment is less than its amortized cost  we assess whether or not i we have the intent to sell the security made a decision to sell or ii it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery 
if either of these conditions is met  an other than temporary impairment is considered to have occurred and we must recognize an other than temporary impairment for the difference between the investment amortized cost basis and its fair value through earnings 
for securities that do not meet the above criteria  and we do not expect to recover a security amortized cost basis  the security is also considered other than temporarily impaired 
for these securities  we separate the total impairment into the credit loss component and the amount of the loss related to other factors 
the amount of the total other than temporary impairment related to credit loss is recognized in earnings 
the amount of the total other than temporary impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income  net of impacts to dac  dsic  certain benefit reserves and income taxes 
for available for sale securities that have recognized an other than temporary impairment through earnings  the difference between the amortized cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected is accreted as interest income if through subsequent evaluation there is a sustained increase in the cash flow expected 
subsequent increases and decreases in the fair value of available for sale securities are included in other comprehensive income 
for all securities that are considered temporarily impaired  we do not intend to sell these securities have not made a decision to sell and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
we believe that we will collect all principal and interest due on all investments that have amortized cost in excess of fair value that are considered only temporarily impaired 
factors we consider in determining whether declines in the fair value of fixed maturity securities are other than temporary include i the extent to which the market value is below amortized cost  ii the duration of time in which there has been a significant decline in value  iii fundamental analysis of the liquidity  business prospects and overall financial condition of the issuer  and iv market events that could impact credit ratings  economic and business climate  litigation and government actions  and similar external business factors 
in order to determine the amount of the credit loss component for corporate debt securities considered other than temporarily impaired  a best estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected discounted at the security effective interest rate is compared to the amortized cost basis of the security 
the significant inputs to cash flow projections consider potential debt restructuring terms  projected cash flows available to pay creditors and our position in the debtor overall capital structure 
for structured investments eg  residential mortgage backed securities  commercial mortgage backed securities  asset backed securities and other structured investments  we also consider factors such as overall deal structure and our position within the structure  quality of underlying collateral  delinquencies and defaults  loss severities  recoveries  prepayments and cumulative loss projections in assessing potential other than temporary impairments of these investments 
based upon these factors  securities that have indicators of potential other than temporary impairment are subject to detailed review by management 
securities for which declines are considered temporary continue to be carefully monitored by management 
deferred acquisition costs and deferred sales inducement costs we adopted new accounting rules for dac on january  on a retrospective basis 
see below for our updated accounting policies on the deferral of acquisition costs 
we incur costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance and annuity businesses 
the portion of these costs which are incremental and direct to the acquisition of a new or renewal insurance policy or annuity contract are deferred 
significant costs capitalized include sales based compensation related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance policies and annuity contracts  medical inspection costs for successful sales  and a portion of employee compensation and benefit costs based upon the amount of time spent on successful sales 
sales based compensation paid to advisors and employees and third party distributers is capitalized 
employee compensation and benefits costs which are capitalized under the new accounting standard relate primarily to sales efforts  underwriting and processing 
all other costs which are not incremental direct costs of acquiring an insurance policy or annuity contract are expensed as incurred 
for our annuity and life  disability income and long term care insurance products  our dac and dsic balances at any reporting date are supported by projections that show management expects there to be adequate premiums or estimated gross profits after that date to amortize the remaining dac and dsic balances 
these projections are inherently uncertain because they require management to make assumptions about financial markets  anticipated mortality and morbidity levels and policyholder behavior over periods extending well into the future 
projection periods used for our annuity products are typically to years 
projection periods for our life insurance and long term care insurance products are often years or longer and projection periods for our disability income products can be up to years 
management regularly monitors financial market conditions and actual policyholder behavior experience and compares them to its assumptions 

table of contents for annuity and ul insurance products  the assumptions made in projecting future results and calculating the dac balance and dac amortization expense are management best estimates 
management is required to update these assumptions whenever it appears that  based on actual experience or other evidence  earlier estimates should be revised 
when assumptions are changed  the percentage of estimated gross profits used to amortize dac might also change 
a change in the required amortization percentage is applied retrospectively  an increase in amortization percentage will result in a decrease in the dac balance and an increase in dac amortization expense  while a decrease in amortization percentage will result in an increase in the dac balance and a decrease in dac amortization expense 
the impact on results of operations of changing assumptions can be either positive or negative in any particular period and is reflected in the period in which such changes are made 
for products with associated dsic  the same policy applies in calculating the dsic balance and periodic dsic amortization 
for other life  disability income and long term care insurance products  the assumptions made in calculating our dac balance and dac amortization expense are consistent with those used in determining the liabilities and  therefore  are intended to provide for adverse deviations in experience and are revised only if management concludes experience will be so adverse that dac are not recoverable 
if management concludes that dac are not recoverable  dac are reduced to the amount that is recoverable based on best estimate assumptions and there is a corresponding expense recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 
for annuity and life  disability income and long term care insurance products  key assumptions underlying these long term projections include interest rates both earning rates on invested assets and rates credited to contractholder and policyholder accounts  equity market performance  mortality and morbidity rates and the rates at which policyholders are expected to surrender their contracts  make withdrawals from their contracts and make additional deposits to their contracts 
assumptions about earned and credited interest rates are the primary factors used to project interest margins  while assumptions about equity and bond market performance are the primary factors used to project client asset value growth rates  and assumptions about surrenders  withdrawals and deposits comprise projected persistency rates 
management must also make assumptions to project maintenance expenses associated with servicing our annuity and insurance businesses during the dac amortization period 
the client asset value growth rates are the rates at which variable annuity and vul insurance contract values invested in separate accounts are assumed to appreciate in the future 
the rates used vary by equity and fixed income investments 
management reviews and  where appropriate  adjusts its assumptions with respect to client asset value growth rates on a regular basis 
the long term client asset value growth rates are based on assumed gross annual returns of for equity funds and for fixed income funds 
we typically use a five year mean reversion process as a guideline in setting near term equity fund growth rates based on a long term view of financial market performance as well as recent actual performance 
the suggested near term equity fund growth rate is reviewed quarterly to ensure consistency with management assessment of anticipated equity market performance 
a decrease of basis points in various rate assumptions is likely to result in an increase in dac and dsic amortization and an increase in benefits and claims expense from variable annuity guarantees 
the following table presents the estimated impact to current period pretax income estimated impact to pretax income in millions decrease in future near and long term fixed income returns by basis points decrease in future near term equity fund growth returns by basis points decrease in future long term equity fund growth returns by basis points decrease in future near and long term equity returns by basis points an increase in the above assumptions by basis points would result in an increase to pretax income for approximately the same amount 
we monitor other principal dac and dsic amortization assumptions  such as persistency  mortality  morbidity  interest margin and maintenance expense levels each quarter and  when assessed independently  each could impact our dac and dsic balances 
the analysis of dac and dsic balances and the corresponding amortization is a dynamic process that considers all relevant factors and assumptions described previously 
unless management identifies a significant deviation over the course of the quarterly monitoring  management reviews and updates these dac and dsic amortization assumptions annually in the third quarter of each year 
an assessment of sensitivity associated with changes in any single assumption would not necessarily be an indicator of future results 

table of contents future policy benefits and claims fixed annuities and variable annuity guarantees future policy benefits and claims related to fixed annuities and variable annuity guarantees include liabilities for fixed account values on fixed and variable deferred annuities  guaranteed benefits associated with variable annuities  equity indexed annuities and fixed annuities in a payout status 
liabilities for fixed account values on fixed and variable deferred annuities are equal to accumulation values  which are the cumulative gross deposits and credited interest less withdrawals and various charges 
the majority of the variable annuity contracts offered by us contain guaranteed minimum death benefit gmdb provisions 
when market values of the customer accounts decline  the death benefit payable on a contract with a gmdb may exceed the contract accumulation value 
we also offer variable annuities with death benefit provisions that gross up the amount payable by a certain percentage of contract earnings which are referred to as gain gross up benefits 
in addition  we offer contracts with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit gmwb and guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit gmab provisions and  until may  we offered contracts containing guaranteed minimum income benefit gmib provisions 
in determining the liabilities for gmdb  gmib and the life contingent benefits associated with gmwb  we project these benefits and contract assessments using actuarial models to simulate various equity market scenarios 
significant assumptions made in projecting future benefits and assessments relate to customer asset value growth rates  mortality  persistency and investment margins and are consistent with those used for dac asset valuation for the same contracts 
as with dac  management reviews  and where appropriate  adjusts its assumptions each quarter 
unless management identifies a material deviation over the course of quarterly monitoring  management reviews and updates these assumptions annually in the third quarter of each year 
the amounts in the table above in deferred acquisition costs and deferred sales inducement costs include the estimated impact to benefits and claims expense related to variable annuity guarantees resulting from a decrease of basis points in various rate assumptions 
the gmdb liability is determined by estimating the expected value of death benefits in excess of the projected contract accumulation value and recognizing the excess over the estimated meaningful life based on expected assessments eg  mortality and expense fees  contractual administrative charges and similar fees 
if elected by the contract owner and after a stipulated waiting period from contract issuance  a gmib guarantees a minimum lifetime annuity based on a specified rate of contract accumulation value growth and predetermined annuity purchase rates 
the gmib liability is determined each period by estimating the expected value of annuitization benefits in excess of the projected contract accumulation value at the date of annuitization and recognizing the excess over the estimated meaningful life based on expected assessments 
the embedded derivatives related to gmab and the non life contingent benefits associated with gmwb provisions are recorded at fair value 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding the fair value measurement of embedded derivatives 
the liability for the life contingent benefits associated with gmwb provisions is determined in the same way as the gmdb liability 
significant assumptions made in projecting future benefits and fees relate to persistency and benefit utilization 
as with dac  management reviews  and where appropriate  adjusts its assumptions each quarter 
unless management identifies a material deviation over the course of quarterly monitoring  management reviews and updates these assumptions annually in the third quarter of each year 
the changes in both the fair values of the gmwb and gmab embedded derivatives and the liability for life contingent benefits are reflected in benefits  claims  losses and settlement expenses 
liabilities for equity indexed annuities are equal to the accumulation of host contract values covering guaranteed benefits and the fair value of embedded equity options 
liabilities for fixed annuities in a benefit or payout status are based on future estimated payments using established industry mortality tables and interest rates  ranging from to at december   depending on year of issue  with an average rate of approximately life  disability income and long term care insurance future policy benefits and claims related to life  disability income and long term care insurance include liabilities for fixed account values on fixed and variable universal life policies  liabilities for indexed accounts of indexed universal life iul products  liabilities for unpaid amounts on reported claims  estimates of benefits payable on claims incurred but not yet reported and estimates of benefits that will become payable on term life  whole life  disability income and long term care policies as claims are incurred in the future 

table of contents liabilities for fixed account values on fixed and variable universal life insurance are equal to accumulation values 
accumulation values are the cumulative gross deposits and credited interest less various contractual expense and mortality charges and less amounts withdrawn by policyholders 
liabilities for indexed accounts of iul products are equal to the accumulation of host contract values covering guaranteed benefits and the fair value of embedded equity options 
a portion of our fixed and variable universal life policies have product features that result in profits followed by losses from the insurance component of the contract 
these profits followed by losses can be generated by the cost structure of the product or secondary guarantees in the contract 
the secondary guarantee ensures that  subject to specified conditions  the policy will not terminate and will continue to provide a death benefit even if there is insufficient policy value to cover the monthly deductions and charges 
in determining the liability for contracts with profits followed by losses  we project benefits and contract assessments using actuarial models 
significant assumptions made in projecting future benefits and assessments relate to customer asset value growth rates  mortality  persistency and investment margins and are consistent with those used for dac asset valuation for the same contracts 
as with dac  management reviews  and where appropriate  adjusts its assumptions each quarter 
unless management identifies a material deviation over the course of quarterly monitoring  management reviews and updates these assumptions annually in the third quarter of each year 
the liability for these future losses is determined by estimating the death benefits in excess of account value and recognizing the excess over the estimated meaningful life based on expected assessments eg cost of insurance charges  contractual administrative charges  similar fees and investment margin 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding the liability for contracts with secondary guarantees 
liabilities for unpaid amounts on reported life insurance claims are equal to the death benefits payable under the policies 
liabilities for unpaid amounts on reported disability income and long term care claims include any periodic or other benefit amounts due and accrued  along with estimates of the present value of obligations for continuing benefit payments 
these amounts are calculated based on claim continuance tables which estimate the likelihood an individual will continue to be eligible for benefits 
present values are calculated at interest rates established when claims are incurred 
anticipated claim continuance rates are based on established industry tables  adjusted as appropriate for our experience 
interest rates used with disability income claims ranged from to at december   with an average rate of 
interest rates used with long term care claims ranged from to at december   with an average rate of liabilities for estimated benefits payable on claims that have been incurred but not yet reported are based on periodic analysis of the actual time lag between when a claim occurs and when it is reported 
liabilities for estimates of benefits that will become payable on future claims on term life  whole life  disability income and long term care policies are based on the net level premium method  using anticipated premium payments  mortality and morbidity rates  policy persistency and interest rates earned on assets supporting the liability 
anticipated mortality and morbidity rates are based on established industry mortality and morbidity tables  with modifications based on our experience 
anticipated premium payments and persistency rates vary by policy form  issue age  policy duration and certain other pricing factors 
anticipated interest rates for term and whole life ranged from to at december   depending on policy form  issue year and policy duration 
anticipated interest rates for disability income policies ranged from to at december   depending on policy form  issue year and policy duration 
anticipated interest rates for long term care policy reserves can vary by plan and year and ranged from to at december  changes in future policy benefits and claims are reflected in earnings in the period adjustments are made 
where applicable  benefit amounts expected to be recoverable from reinsurance companies who share in the risk are separately recorded as reinsurance recoverable within receivables 
derivative instruments and hedging activities we use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to various market risks 
examples include index options  interest rate swaps and swaptions  total return swaps  and futures that economically hedge the equity and interest rate exposure of derivatives embedded in certain annuity  life and certificate liabilities  as well as exposure to price risk arising from affiliated mutual fund seed money investments 
all derivatives are recorded at fair value 
the fair value of our derivative instruments is determined using either market quotes or valuation models that are based upon the net present value of estimated future cash flows and incorporate current market observable inputs to the extent available 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on its intended use and the resulting hedge designation  if any 
we primarily use derivatives as economic hedges that are not designated as accounting hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
we occasionally designate derivatives as i hedges of changes in the fair value of assets  liabilities or firm commitments fair value hedges  ii hedges of a forecasted transaction or of the 
table of contents variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability cash flow hedges or iii hedges of foreign currency exposures of net investments in foreign operations net investment hedges in foreign operations 
our accounting policy is to not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivatives and collateral arrangements executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting arrangement 
for derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not designated as accounting hedges  changes in fair value are recognized in current period earnings 
for derivative instruments that qualify as fair value hedges  changes in the fair value of the derivatives  as well as changes in the fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments  are recognized on a net basis in current period earnings 
the carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted for the change in fair value from the designated hedged risk 
if a fair value hedge designation is removed or the hedge is terminated prior to maturity  previous adjustments to the carrying value of the hedged item are recognized into earnings over the remaining life of the hedged item 
for derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instruments is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings when the hedged item or transaction impacts earnings 
the amount that is reclassified into earnings is presented in the consolidated statements of operations with the hedged instrument or transaction impact 
any ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in current period earnings as a component of net investment income 
if a hedge designation is removed or a hedge is terminated prior to maturity  the amount previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income is reclassified to earnings over the period that the hedged item impacts earnings 
for any hedge relationships that are discontinued because the forecasted transaction is not expected to occur according to the original strategy  any related amounts previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are recognized in earnings immediately 
for derivative instruments that qualify as net investment hedges in foreign operations  the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as part of the foreign currency translation adjustment 
any ineffective portion of net investment hedges in foreign operations is recognized in net investment income during the period of change 
for further details on the types of derivatives we use and how we account for them  see note and note to our consolidated financial statements 
income tax accounting income taxes  as reported in our consolidated financial statements  represent the net amount of income taxes that we expect to pay to or receive from various taxing jurisdictions in connection with our operations 
we provide for income taxes based on amounts that we believe we will ultimately owe taking into account the recognition and measurement for uncertain tax positions 
inherent in the provision for income taxes are estimates and judgments regarding the tax treatment of certain items 
in the event that the ultimate tax treatment of items differs from our estimates  we may be required to significantly change the provision for income taxes recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the provision for income taxes  our consolidated financial statements reflect certain amounts related to deferred tax assets and liabilities  which result from temporary differences between the assets and liabilities measured for financial statement purposes versus the assets and liabilities measured for tax return purposes 
included in deferred tax assets are significant capital losses that have been recognized for financial statement purposes but not yet for tax return purposes as well as future deductible capital losses realized for tax return purposes 
under current us federal income tax law  capital losses generally must be used against capital gain income within five years of the year in which the capital losses are recognized for tax purposes 
we are required to establish a valuation allowance for any portion of our deferred tax assets that management believes will not be realized 
significant judgment is required in determining if a valuation allowance should be established  and the amount of such allowance if required 
factors used in making this determination include estimates relating to the performance of the business  including the ability to generate capital gains 
consideration is given to  among other things in making this determination  i future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  ii future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  iii taxable income in prior carryback years  and iv tax planning strategies 
management may need to identify and implement appropriate planning strategies to ensure our ability to realize our deferred tax assets and avoid the establishment of a valuation allowance with respect to such assets 
in the opinion of management  it is currently more likely than not that we will not realize the full benefit of certain state net operating losses and therefore a valuation allowance of million has been established at december  recent accounting pronouncements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our future consolidated results of operations and financial condition  see note to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents we adopted new accounting rules for dac on january  on a retrospective basis 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for the impact of the adoption on prior period results of operations and financial condition 
sources of revenues and expenses management and financial advice fees management and financial advice fees relate primarily to fees earned from managing mutual funds  separate account and wrap account assets and institutional investments  as well as fees earned from providing financial advice and administrative services including transfer agent  administration and custodial fees earned from providing services to retail mutual funds 
management and financial advice fees also include mortality and expense risk fees earned on separate account assets 
our management fees are generally accrued daily and collected monthly 
a significant portion of our management fees are calculated as a percentage of the fair value of our managed assets 
the substantial majority of our managed assets are valued by third party pricing services vendors based upon observable market data 
the selection of our third party pricing services vendors and the reliability of their prices are subject to certain governance procedures  such as exception reporting  subsequent transaction testing  and annual due diligence of our vendors  which includes assessing the vendor valuation qualifications  control environment  analysis of asset class specific valuation methodologies and understanding of sources of market observable assumptions

the market impact on amortization of dac was an expense of million in compared to a benefit of million in the prior year as a result of unfavorable equity markets in compared to improving equity markets in amortization of dac in included a benefit of million as a result of the implementation of changes to the portfolio navigator program

fair value measurements we report certain assets and liabilities at fair value  specifically  separate account assets  derivatives  embedded derivatives  properties held by our consolidated property funds  and most investments and cash equivalents 
fair value assumes the exchange of assets or liabilities occurs in orderly transactions 
companies are not permitted to use market prices that are the result of a forced liquidation or distressed sale 
we include actual market prices  or observable inputs  in our fair value measurements to the extent available 
broker quotes are obtained when quotes from pricing services are not available 
we validate prices obtained from third parties through a variety of means such as price variance analysis  subsequent sales testing  stale price review  price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of vendors 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our fair value measurements 
non agency residential mortgage backed securities backed by sub prime  alt a or prime collateral sub prime mortgage lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to customers with weak credit profiles 
alt a mortgage lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to customers who have credit ratings above sub prime but may not conform to government sponsored standards 
prime mortgage lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to customers with good credit profiles 
we have exposure to each of these types of loans predominantly through mortgage backed securities 
the slowdown in the us housing market  combined with relaxed underwriting standards by some originators  has led to higher delinquency and loss rates for some of these investments 
persistent market conditions have increased the likelihood of other than temporary impairments for certain non agency residential mortgage backed 
table of contents securities 
as a part of our risk management process  an internal rating system is used in conjunction with market data as the basis of analysis to assess the likelihood that we will not receive all contractual principal and interest payments for these investments 
for the investments that are more at risk for impairment  we perform our own assessment of projected cash flows incorporating assumptions about default rates  prepayment speeds and loss severity to determine if an other than temporary impairment should be recognized

table of contents the non financial corporate debt holdings in italy  ireland and spain are primarily in utilities telecommunications 
the non financial corporate debt holdings in other european countries are multinational companies concentrated in utilities and non cyclical industrials 
we have no exposure to deeply subordinated instruments 
we do not hedge our european exposure and we have no unfunded commitments related to our european debt holdings as of december  fair value of liabilities and nonperformance risk companies are required to measure the fair value of liabilities at the price that would be received to transfer the liability to a market participant an exit price 
since there is not a market for our obligations of our variable annuity riders  we consider the assumptions participants in a hypothetical market would make to reflect an exit price 
as a result  we adjust the valuation of variable annuity riders by updating certain contractholder assumptions  adding explicit margins to provide for profit  risk and expenses  and adjusting the rates used to discount expected cash flows to reflect a current market estimate of our nonperformance risk 
the nonperformance risk adjustment is based on broker quotes for credit default swaps that are adjusted to estimate the risk of our life insurance company subsidiaries not fulfilling these liabilities 
consistent with general market conditions  this estimate resulted in a spread over the libor swap curve as of december  as our estimate of this spread widens or tightens  the liability will decrease or increase 
if this nonperformance credit spread moves to a zero spread over the libor swap curve  the reduction to net income would be approximately million  net of dac and dsic amortization and income taxes calculated at the statutory tax rate of  based on december  credit spreads 
liquidity and capital resources overview we maintained substantial liquidity during the year ended december  at december   we had billion in cash and cash equivalents compared to billion at december  we have additional liquidity available through an unsecured revolving credit facility for up to million that expires in november under the terms of the underlying credit agreement  we can increase this facility to million upon satisfaction of certain approval requirements 
available borrowings under this facility are reduced by any outstanding letters of credit 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and had million of outstanding letters of credit 
our junior subordinated notes due and credit facility contain various administrative  reporting  legal and financial covenants 
we were in compliance with all such covenants at both december  and our subsidiary  riversource life insurance company riversource life  is a member of the federal home loan bank fhlb of des moines  which provides access to collateralized borrowings 
as of december   we had no borrowings from the fhlb 
we enter into repurchase agreements to reduce reinvestment risk from higher levels of expected annuity net cash flows 
repurchase agreements allow us to receive cash to reinvest in longer duration assets  while paying back the short term debt with cash flows generated by the fixed income portfolio 
the balance of repurchase agreements at december  was million  which is collateralized with agency residential mortgage backed securities and commercial mortgage backed securities from our investment portfolio 
we believe cash flows from operating activities  available cash balances and our availability of revolver borrowings will be sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk our primary market risk exposures are interest rate  equity price  foreign currency exchange rate and credit risk 
equity price and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations  primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset based fees we earn  the spread income generated on our annuities  brokerage client cash balances and face amount certificate products and ul insurance products  the value of dac and dsic assets  the value of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the value of derivatives held to hedge these benefits 
the guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities are gmwb  guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits gmab  guaranteed minimum death benefits gmdb and guaranteed minimum income benefits gmib 
each of 
table of contents these guaranteed benefits guarantees payouts to the annuity holder under certain specific conditions regardless of the performance of the underlying investment assets 
we continue to utilize a hedging program which attempts to match the sensitivity of the assets with the sensitivity of the liabilities 
this approach works with the premise that matched sensitivities will produce a highly effective hedging result 
our comprehensive hedging program focuses mainly on first order sensitivities of assets and liabilities  equity market level delta  interest rate level rho and volatility vega 
additionally  various second order sensitivities are managed 
we use various index options across the term structure  interest rate swaps and swaptions  total return swaps and futures to manage the risk exposures 
the exposures are measured and monitored daily  and adjustments to the hedge portfolio are made as necessary 
to evaluate interest rate and equity price risk we perform sensitivity testing which measures the impact on pretax income from the sources listed below for a month period following a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates or a hypothetical decline in equity prices 
the interest rate risk test assumes a sudden basis point parallel shift in the yield curve  with rates then staying at those levels for the next months 
the equity price risk test assumes a sudden drop in equity prices  with equity prices then staying at those levels for the next months 
in estimating the values of variable annuity riders  equity indexed annuities  stock market certificates  indexed universal life insurance and the associated hedge assets  we assumed no change in implied market volatility despite the drop in equity prices 
the following tables present our estimate of the impact on pretax income from these hypothetical market movements as of december  equity price exposure to pretax income equity price decline before hedge impact hedge impact net impact in millions asset based management and distribution fees dac and dsic amortization variable annuity riders gmdb and gmib gmwb gmab dac and dsic amortization n a n a total variable annuity riders equity indexed annuities certificates indexed universal life insurance total interest rate exposure to pretax income interest rate increase basis points before hedge impact hedge impact net impact in millions asset based management and distribution fees variable annuity riders gmwb gmab dac and dsic amortization n a n a total variable annuity riders fixed annuities  fixed portion of variable annuities and fixed insurance products brokerage client cash balances certificates indexed universal life insurance total n a not applicable 
excludes incentive income which is impacted by market and fund performance during the period and cannot be readily estimated 
market impact on dac and dsic amortization resulting from lower projected profits 
in estimating the impact on dac and dsic amortization resulting from lower projected profits  we have not changed our assumed equity asset growth rates 
this is a significantly more conservative estimate than if we assumed management follows its mean reversion guideline and increased near term rates to recover the drop in equity values over a five year period 
we make this same conservative assumption in estimating the impact from gmdb and gmib riders 
market impact on dac and dsic amortization related to variable annuity riders is modeled net of hedge impact 
the above results compare to an estimated negative net impact to pretax income of million related to a equity price decline and an estimated positive net impact to pretax income of million related to a basis point increase 
table of contents in interest rates as of december  the change in the interest rate exposure was primarily related to fixed annuities and the fixed portion of variable annuities  which increased approximately million primarily driven by model updates  namely enhanced reflection of recent mortgage prepayment experience and enhanced asset portfolio turn over logic 
the underlying interest rate sensitivity of the fixed annuity and fixed portion of variable annuities has not materially changed due to market conditions 
the change in interest rate exposure also increased million  primarily driven by higher brokerage client cash balances 
net impacts shown in the above table from gmwb and gmab riders result largely from differences between the liability valuation basis and the hedging basis 
liabilities are valued using fair value accounting principles  with key policyholder behavior assumptions loaded to provide risk margins and with discount rates increased to reflect a current market estimate of our risk of nonperformance specific to these liabilities 
for variable annuity riders introduced prior to mid  management elected to hedge based on best estimate policyholder behavior assumptions 
for riders issued since mid  management has been hedging on a basis that includes risk margins related to policyholder behavior 
the nonperformance spread risk is not hedged 
actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above as they are based on a number of estimates and assumptions 
these include assuming that implied market volatility does not change when equity prices fall by  that management does not increase assumed equity asset growth rates to anticipate recovery of the drop in equity values when valuing dac  dsic and gmdb and gmib liability values and that the basis point increase in interest rates is a parallel shift of the yield curve 
furthermore  we have not tried to anticipate changes in client preferences for different types of assets or other changes in client behavior  nor have we tried to anticipate actions management might take to increase revenues or reduce expenses in these scenarios 
the selection of a basis point interest rate increase as well as a equity price decline should not be construed as a prediction of future market events 
impacts of larger or smaller changes in interest rates or equity prices may not be proportional to those shown for a basis point increase in interest rates or a decline in equity prices 
asset based management and distribution fees we earn asset based management fees and distribution fees on our assets under management 
at december   the value of our assets under management was billion 
these sources of revenue are subject to both interest rate and equity price risk since the value of these assets and the fees they earn fluctuate inversely with interest rates and directly with equity prices 
we do not currently hedge the interest rate or equity price risk of this exposure 
dac and dsic amortization for annuity and ul products  dac and dsic are amortized on the basis of estimated gross profits 
estimated gross profits are a proxy for pretax income prior to the recognition of dac and dsic amortization expense 
when events occur that reduce or increase current period estimated gross profits  dac and dsic amortization expense is typically reduced or increased as well  somewhat mitigating the impact of the event on pretax income 
variable annuity riders the total contract value of all variable annuities at december  was billion compared to billion at december  these contract values include gmwb and gmab contracts which were billion and billion  respectively  at december   compared to billion and billion  respectively  at december  at december   reserves for gmwb and gmab were million and million  respectively  compared to billion and million  respectively  at december  the decrease in reserves for gmwb and gmab reflect the changes in economic factors impacting the mark to market value of the guarantees 
at december   the reserve for the other variable annuity guaranteed benefits  gmdb and gmib  was million compared to million at december  equity price risk variable annuity riders the variable annuity guaranteed benefits guarantee payouts to the annuity holder under certain specific conditions regardless of the performance of the investment assets 
for this reason  when equity prices decline  the returns from the separate account assets coupled with guaranteed benefit fees from annuity holders may not be sufficient to fund expected payouts 
in that case  reserves must be increased with a negative impact to earnings 
the core derivative instruments with which we hedge the equity price risk of our gmwb and gmab provisions are longer dated put and call derivatives  these core instruments are supplemented with equity futures and total return swaps 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our derivative instruments 

table of contents interest rate risk variable annuity riders the gmab and the non life contingent benefits associated with the gmwb provisions create embedded derivatives which are carried at fair value separately from the underlying host variable annuity contract 
changes in the fair value of the gmwb and gmab liabilities are recorded through earnings with fair value calculated based on projected  discounted cash flows over the life of the contract  including projected  discounted benefits and fees 
increases in interest rates reduce the fair value of the gmwb and gmab liabilities 
the gmwb and gmab interest rate exposure is hedged with a portfolio of longer dated put and call derivatives  interest rate swaps and swaptions 
we have entered into interest rate swaps according to risk exposures along maturities  thus creating both fixed rate payor and variable rate payor terms 
if interest rates were to increase  we would have to pay more to the swap counterparty  and the fair value of our equity puts would decrease  resulting in a negative impact to our pretax income 
fixed annuities  fixed portion of variable annuities and fixed insurance products interest rate exposures arise primarily with respect to the fixed account portion of annuity and insurance products of riversource life companies and their investment portfolios 
we guarantee an interest rate to the holders of these products 
premiums and deposits collected from clients are primarily invested in fixed rate securities to fund the client credited rate with the spread between the rate earned from investments and the rate credited to clients recorded as earned income 
client liabilities and investment assets generally differ as it relates to basis  repricing or maturity characteristics 
rates credited to clients accounts generally reset at shorter intervals than the yield on the underlying investments 
therefore  generally speaking in an increasing interest rate environment  higher interest rates may be reflected in crediting rates to clients sooner than in rates earned on invested assets  which could result in a reduced spread between the two rates  reduced earned income and a negative impact on pretax income 
however  today historically low interest rate environment is resulting in interest rates below the level of some liability guaranteed minimum interest rates gmirs 
given that  a modest rise in interest rates would not necessarily result in any change to the liability credits while projected asset purchases would capture the full increase in interest rates 
this dynamic would result in widening spreads under a modestly rising rate scenario given the current relationship between the current level of interest rates and the underlying gmirs on the business 
of the billion in future policy benefits and claims on our consolidated balance sheet at december   billion is related to liabilities created by these products 
we do not hedge this exposure 
equity indexed annuities our equity indexed annuity product is a single premium annuity issued with an initial term of seven years 
the annuity guarantees the contractholder a minimum return of on of the initial premium or end of prior term accumulation value upon renewal plus a return that is linked to the performance of the s p index 
the equity linked return is based on a participation rate initially set at between and of the s p index  which is guaranteed for the initial seven year term when the contract is held to full term 
at december   we had million in reserves related to equity indexed annuities 
we discontinued new sales of equity indexed annuities in equity price risk equity indexed annuities the equity linked return to investors creates equity price risk as the amount credited depends on changes in equity prices 
to hedge this exposure  we purchase futures  calls and puts which generate returns to replicate what we must credit to client accounts 
in conjunction with purchasing puts we also write puts 
pairing purchased puts with written puts allows us to better match the characteristics of the liability 
interest rate risk equity indexed annuities most of the proceeds received from equity indexed annuities are invested in fixed income securities with the return on those investments intended to fund the guarantee 
we earn income from the difference between the return earned on invested assets and the guarantee rate credited to customer accounts 
the spread between return earned and amount credited is affected by changes in interest rates 
this risk is not currently hedged and was immaterial at december  brokerage client cash balances we pay interest on certain brokerage client cash balances and have the ability to reset these rates from time to time based on prevailing economic and business conditions 
we earn revenue to fund the interest paid from interest earning assets or fees from off balance sheet deposits at fdic insured institutions  which are indexed to short term interest rates 
in general  the change in interest paid lags the change in revenues earned 

table of contents certificate products fixed rate certificates we have interest rate risk from our investment certificates generally ranging in amounts from  to million with interest crediting rate terms ranging from three to months 
we guarantee an interest rate to the holders of these products 
payments collected from clients are primarily invested in fixed rate securities to fund the client credited rate with the spread between the rate earned from investments and the rate credited to clients recorded as earned income 
client liabilities and investment assets generally differ as it relates to basis  repricing or maturity characteristics 
rates credited to clients generally reset at shorter intervals than the yield on underlying investments 
this exposure is not currently hedged although we monitor our investment strategy and make modifications based on our changing liabilities and the expected interest rate environment 
of the billion in customer deposits at december   billion related to reserves for our fixed rate certificate products 
stock market certificates stock market certificates are purchased for amounts generally from  to million for terms of weeks which can be extended to a maximum of years 
for each term the certificate holder can choose to participate in any percentage increase in the s p index up to a maximum return or choose partial participation in any increase in the s p index plus a fixed rate of interest guaranteed in advance 
if partial participation is selected  the total of equity linked return and guaranteed rate of interest cannot exceed the maximum return 
reserves for our stock market certificates are included in customer deposits on our consolidated balance sheets 
at december   we had million in reserves related to stock market certificates 
the equity linked return to investors creates equity price risk exposure 
we seek to minimize this exposure with purchased futures and call spreads that replicate what we must credit to client accounts 
this risk continues to be fully hedged 
stock market certificates have some interest rate risk as changes in interest rates affect the fair value of the payout to be made to the certificate holder 
this risk is not currently hedged and was immaterial at december  indexed universal life in  we began offering iul insurance 
iul is similar to ul in that it provides life insurance coverage and cash value that increases as a result of credited interest 
also  like ul  there is a minimum guaranteed credited rate of interest 
unlike ul the rate of credited interest above the minimum guarantee for funds allocated to the indexed account is linked to the s p index subject to a cap 
the policyholder may allocate all or a portion of the policy value to a fixed or indexed account 
at december   we had million in reserves related to the index account of iul 
equity price risk indexed universal life the equity linked return to investors creates equity price risk as the amount credited depends on changes in equity prices 
most of the proceeds received from iul insurance are invested in fixed income securities 
to hedge the equity exposure  a portion of the investment earnings received from the fixed income securities is used to purchase call spreads which generate returns to replicate what we must credit to client accounts 
interest rate risk indexed universal life as mentioned above  most of the proceeds received from iul insurance are invested in fixed income securities with the return on those investments intended to fund the purchase of call spreads 
there are two risks relating to interest rates 
first  we have the risk that investment returns are such that we do not have enough investment income to purchase the needed call spreads 
second  in the event the policy is surrendered we pay out a book value surrender amount and there is a risk that we will incur a loss upon having to sell the fixed income securities backing the liability if interest rates have risen 
this risk is not currently hedged 
foreign currency risk we have foreign currency risk through our net investment in foreign subsidiaries and our operations in foreign countries 
we are primarily exposed to changes in british pounds gbp related to our net investment in threadneedle  which was million gbp at december  our primary exposure related to operations in foreign countries is to the gbp and the indian rupee 
we monitor the foreign exchange rates that we have exposure to and enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate risk when economically prudent 
at december   the notional value of outstanding contracts and our remaining foreign currency risk related to operations in foreign countries were not material 
interest rate risk on external debt the stated interest rate on the billion of our senior unsecured notes is fixed and the stated interest rate on the million of junior notes is fixed until june  in  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert the fixed interest rate on billion of the senior unsecured notes to floating interest rates based on 
table of contents six month libor 
we hedged the debt in part to better align the interest expense on debt with the interest earned on cash equivalents held on our consolidated balance sheets 
the net interest rate risk of these items is immaterial 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk within our investment portfolio  including our loan portfolio  and through our derivative and reinsurance activities 
credit risk relates to the uncertainty of an obligor continued ability to make timely payments in accordance with the contractual terms of the financial instrument or contract 
we consider our total potential credit exposure to each counterparty and its affiliates to ensure compliance with pre established credit guidelines at the time we enter into a transaction which would potentially increase our credit risk 
these guidelines and oversight of credit risk are managed through a comprehensive enterprise risk management program that includes members of senior management 
we manage the risk of credit related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties by applying disciplined fundamental credit analysis and underwriting standards  prudently limiting exposures to lower quality  higher yielding investments  and diversifying exposures by issuer  industry  region and underlying investment type 
we remain exposed to occasional adverse cyclical economic downturns during which default rates may be significantly higher than the long term historical average used in pricing 
we manage our credit risk related to over the counter derivatives by entering into transactions with creditworthy counterparties  maintaining collateral arrangements and through the use of master netting arrangements that provide for a single net payment to be made by one counterparty to another at each due date and upon termination 
generally  our current credit exposure on over the counter derivative contracts is limited to a derivative counterparty net positive fair value of derivative contracts after taking into consideration the existence of netting arrangements and any collateral received 
this exposure is monitored and managed to an acceptable threshold level 
because exchange traded futures are effected through regulated exchanges and positions are marked to market and generally cash settled on a daily basis  we have minimal exposure to credit related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to such derivative instruments 
we manage our credit risk related to reinsurance treaties by evaluating the financial condition of reinsurance counterparties prior to entering into new reinsurance treaties 
in addition  we regularly evaluate their financial strength during the terms of the treaties 
as of december   our largest reinsurance credit risk is related to a long term care coinsurance treaty with life insurance subsidiaries of genworth financial  inc see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on reinsurance
