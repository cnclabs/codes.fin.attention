the company products and services include products for original equipment manufacturers oem and emerging technology et customers that are microprocessor based systems that include transducers  printed circuit boards and assemblies  sensors  and electromechanical components  as well as development and design engineering services relating to these product sales 
sparton also develops and manufactures sonobuoys  anti submarine warfare asw devices used by the united states navy and other free world countries 
many of the physical and technical attributes in the production of sonobuoys are similar to those required in the production of the company other electrical and electromechanical products and assemblies 
the company uses an internal management reporting system  which provides important financial data to evaluate performance and allocate the company resources on a segment basis 
net sales are attributed to the segment in which the product is manufactured or service is performed 
a segment performance is evaluated based upon its operating income loss 
a segment operating income loss includes its gross profit on sales less its selling and administrative expenses  including allocations of certain corporate operating expenses 
certain corporate operating expenses are allocated to segment results based on the nature of the service provided 
other corporate operating expenses  including certain administrative  financial and human resource activities as well as items such as interest expense  interest income  other income expense and income tax expense benefit  are not allocated to operations and are excluded from segment profit 
these costs are not allocated to the segments  as management excludes such costs when assessing the performance of the segments 
inter segment transactions are generally accounted for at amounts that approximate arm length transactions 
identifiable assets by segments are those assets that are used in each segment operations 
the accounting policies for each of the segments are the same as for the company taken as a whole

the sonobuoy product line is built to stringent military specifications 
these products are restricted by international tariff and arms regulations itar and qualified by the us navy  which limits opportunities for competition 
additionally  this business unit internally develops and markets commercial products for underwater acoustics and microelectromechanical mems based inertial measurement 
risks and uncertainties sparton  as a high mix  low to medium volume supplier  provides rapid product turnaround for customers 
high mix describes customers needing multiple product types with generally low to medium volume manufacturing runs 
as a contract manufacturer with customers in a variety of markets  the company has substantially less visibility of end user demand and  therefore  forecasting sales can be problematic 
customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities and or reschedule production for a number of reasons 
depressed economic conditions may result in customers delaying delivery of product  or the placement of purchase orders for lower volumes than previously anticipated 
unplanned cancellations  reductions  or delays by customers may negatively impact the company results of operations 
as many of the company costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed within given ranges of production  a reduction in customer demand can disproportionately affect the company gross margins and operating income 
the majority of the company sales have historically come from a limited number of customers 
significant reductions in sales to  or a loss of  one of these customers could materially impact our operating results if the company were not able to replace those sales with new business 
other risks and uncertainties that may affect our operations  performance  growth forecasts and business results include  but are not limited to  timing and fluctuations in us and or world economies  sharp volatility of world financial markets over a short period of time  competition in the overall contract manufacturing business  availability of production labor and management services under terms acceptable to the company  congressional budget outlays for sonobuoy development and production  congressional legislation  uncertainties associated with the outcome of litigation  changes in the interpretation of environmental laws and the uncertainties of environmental remediation and customer labor and work strikes 
further risk factors are the availability and cost of materials  as well as non cancelable purchase orders we have committed to in relation to customer forecasts that can be subject to change 
a number of events can impact these risks and uncertainties  including potential escalating utility and other related costs due to natural disasters  as well as political uncertainties such as the unrest in africa and the middle east 
additional trends  risks and uncertainties include dependence on key personnel  risks surrounding acquisitions  uncertainties surrounding the global economy  us healthcare legislation and us budget sequestration and the effects of those uncertainties on oem behavior  including heightened inventory management  product development cycles and outsourcing strategies 
finally  the sarbanes oxley act  and more recently the dodd frank act  have required or will require changes in  and formalization of  some of the company corporate governance and compliance practices 
the sec and the new york stock exchange have also passed or will pass related rules and regulations requiring additional compliance activities  including those implementing the conflict minerals provisions of the dodd frank act 
compliance with these rules has increased administrative costs and may increase these costs further in the future 
a further discussion of the company s risk factors has been included in part i  item a  risk factors  of this annual report on form k 
management cautions readers not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which are subject to influence by the enumerated risk factors as well as unanticipated future events

inflation we believe that inflation has not had a significant impact in the past and is not likely to have a significant impact in the foreseeable future on our results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported as assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates are regularly evaluated and are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  which is included in item  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of sparton s board of directors 
environmental contingencies one of sparton s former manufacturing facilities  located in albuquerque  new mexico coors road  has been the subject of ongoing investigations and remediation efforts conducted with the epa under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra 
as discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k  sparton has accrued its estimate of the minimum future non discounted financial liability 
the estimate was developed using existing technology and excludes legal and related consulting costs 
the minimum cost estimate includes equipment  operating and monitoring costs for both onsite and offsite remediation 
sparton recognizes certain legal costs in the periods incurred and reviews its epa accrual activity quarterly 
uncertainties associated with environmental remediation contingencies are pervasive and often result in wide ranges of reasonably possible outcomes 
estimates developed in the early stages of remediation can vary significantly 
normally a finite estimate of cost does not become fixed and determinable at a specific point in time 
rather  the costs associated with environmental remediation become estimable over a continuum of events and activities that help to frame and define a liability 
factors which cause uncertainties for the company include  but are not limited to  the effectiveness of the current work plans in achieving targeted results and proposals of regulatory agencies for desired methods and outcomes 
it is possible that cash flows and results of operations could be materially affected by the impact of changes associated with the ultimate resolution of this contingency 
at june   the company estimates that it is reasonably possible  but not probable  that future environmental remediation costs associated with the company s past operations at the coors road property  in excess of amounts already recorded and net of doe reimbursement  could be up to million before income taxes over the next seventeen years 

table of contents government contract cost estimates government production contracts are accounted for based on completed units accepted under the percentage of completion method with respect to revenue recognition and their estimated average cost per unit regarding costs 
losses for the entire amount of the contract are recognized in the period when such losses are determinable 
significant judgment is exercised in determining estimated total contract costs including  but not limited to  cost experience to date  estimated length of time to contract completion  costs for materials  production labor and support services to be expended and known issues on remaining units to be completed 
in addition  estimated total contract costs can be significantly affected by changing test routines and procedures  resulting design modifications and production rework from these changing test routines and procedures  and limited range access for testing these design modifications and rework solutions 
estimated costs developed in the early stages of contracts can change  sometimes significantly  as the contracts progress  and events and activities take place 
changes in estimates can also occur when new designs are initially placed into production 
the company formally reviews its costs incurred to date and estimated costs to complete on all significant contracts at least quarterly and revised estimated total contract costs are reflected in the financial statements 
performance based payments in excess of inventoried costs are included in current liabilities 
depending upon the circumstances  it is possible that the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by changes in estimated costs to complete on one or more significant government contracts 
commercial inventory valuation valuation of commercial customer inventories requires a significant degree of judgment 
these valuations are influenced by the company s experience to date with both customers and other markets  prevailing market conditions for raw materials  contractual terms and customers ability to satisfy these obligations  environmental or technological materials obsolescence  changes in demand for customer products  and other factors resulting in acquiring materials in excess of customer product demand 
contracts with some commercial customers may be based upon estimated quantities of product manufactured for shipment over estimated time periods 
raw material inventories are purchased to fulfill these customer requirements 
within these arrangements  customer demand for products frequently changes  sometimes creating excess and obsolete inventories 
the company regularly reviews raw material inventories by customer for both excess and obsolete quantities 
wherever possible  the company attempts to recover its full cost of excess and obsolete inventories from customers or  in some cases  through other markets 
when it is determined that the company s carrying cost of such excess and obsolete inventories cannot be recovered in full  a charge is taken against income for the difference between the carrying cost and the estimated realizable amount 
these cost adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory create a new cost basis for the inventory 
the company recorded inventory write downs totaling approximately million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
these charges are included in cost of goods sold for the periods presented 
if inventory that has previously been impaired is subsequently sold  the amount of reduced cost basis is reflected as cost of goods sold 
the company experienced minimal subsequent sales of excess and obsolete inventory during the three years ended june  that resulted in higher gross margins due to previous write downs 
such sales and the impact of those sales on gross margin were not material to the years presented 
if assumptions the company has used to value its inventory deteriorate in the future  additional write downs may be required 
allowance for probable losses on receivables the accounts receivable balance is recorded net of allowances for amounts not expected to be collected from customers 
the allowance is estimated based on historical experience of write offs  the level of past due amounts  information known about specific customers with respect to their ability to make payments  and future expectations of conditions that might impact the collectability of accounts 
accounts receivable are generally due under normal trade terms for the industry 
credit is granted  and credit evaluations are periodically performed  based on a customer s financial condition and other factors 
although the company does not generally require collateral  cash in advance or letters of credit may be required from customers in certain circumstances  including some foreign customers 
when management determines that it is probable that an account will not be collected  it is charged against the allowance for probable losses 
the company reviews the adequacy of its allowance monthly 
the allowance for doubtful accounts considered necessary was approximately million and million at june  and  respectively 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment  additional allowances may be required 
given the company s significant balance of government receivables and in some cases letters of credit from foreign customers  collection risk is considered minimal 
historically  uncollectible accounts have generally been insignificant  have generally not exceeded management s expectations  and the allowance is deemed adequate 

table of contents pension obligations the company calculates the cost of providing pension benefits under the provisions of fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  compensation retirement benefits  asc topic 
the key assumptions required within the provisions of asc topic are used in making these calculations 
the most significant of these assumptions are the discount rate used to value the future obligations and the expected return on pension plan assets 
the discount rate is consistent with market interest rates on high quality  fixed income investments 
the expected return on assets is based on long term returns and assets held by the plan  which is influenced by historical averages 
if actual interest rates and returns on plan assets materially differ from the assumptions  future adjustments to the financial statements would be required 
while changes in these assumptions can have a significant effect on the pension benefit obligation and the unrecognized gain or loss accounts disclosed in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the effect of changes in these assumptions is not expected to have the same relative effect on net periodic pension expense in the near term 
while these assumptions may change in the future based on changes in long term interest rates and market conditions  there are no known expected changes in these assumptions as of june  as indicated above  to the extent the assumptions differ from actual results  there would be a future impact on the financial statements 
the extent to which this will result in future expense is not determinable at this time as it will depend upon a number of variables  including trends in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets 
the annual actuarial valuation of the pension plan is completed at the end of each fiscal year 
based on these valuations  net periodic pension income cost for fiscal years  and was calculated to be million  million and million  respectively  prior to settlement expenses of million for fiscal effective april   participation and the accrual of benefits in the company s pension plan were frozen  at which time all participants became fully vested and all remaining prior service costs were recognized 
lump sum benefit distributions during fiscal years exceeded plan service and interest costs  resulting in a lump sum settlement charge of approximately million also being recognized during the respective years 
the components of net periodic pension expense are detailed in note  employee retirement benefit plans  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
business combinations the company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with asc topic  business combinations 
accordingly  the company recognizes amounts for identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed equal to their estimated acquisition date fair values 
transaction and integration costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred 
any excess of the acquisition price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill while any excess of the estimated fair value of net assets acquired over the acquisition price is recorded in current earnings as a gain 
the company makes various assumptions in estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
as fair value is a market based measurement  it is determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use 
the most significant assumptions typically relate to the estimated fair values of inventory and intangible assets  including customer lists and non compete agreements 
management arrives at estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired business and is inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected discounted cash flows from customer relationships and contracts assuming similar product platforms and completed projects  the acquired company s market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired customer relationships will continue to generate revenue streams  and attrition and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results  particularly with respect to amortization periods assigned to identifiable intangible assets 
valuation of property  plant and equipment the company records an impairment charge on our investment in property  plant and equipment that we hold and use in our operations if and when management determines that the related carrying values may not be recoverable 
if one or more impairment indicators are deemed to exist  sparton will measure any impairment of these assets based on current independent appraisals or a projected discounted cash flow analysis using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model 
our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated operating results and are subject to many factors 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets the company tests for possible goodwill impairment annually or more often should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable 
the test is conducted at the reporting unit level 
sparton has three reportable business segments medical  complex systems  and dss 
in fiscal and  medical  complex systems and dss each consist of a single reporting unit 
all of the company s goodwill resides within the medical reporting unit and  for fiscal and  goodwill impairment testing was conducted on this single reporting unit  which in fiscal included goodwill related to the business acquired from onyx ems  llc during the year 
in fiscal  medical consisted of two reporting units i the company s ohio business purchased from astro instrumentation  llc astro during fiscal and holding the goodwill related to the astro purchase  and ii the company s colorado businesses acquired from delphi and byers peak during fiscal and holding the goodwill related to the byers peak acquisition 
for fiscal  goodwill impairment testing was conducted on these two medical segment reporting units 
the ohio and newly acquired combined colorado businesses were considered separate operating segments and therefore separate reporting units during fiscal due to the nature of how these businesses were managed and internally reported on during that year 
during fiscal  these two businesses were aggregated as one operating segment and therefore one reporting unit due to the similar nature of their businesses and combined manner in which they were managed and internally reported on during the year 
in fiscal  the company elected to perform a qualitative assessment for its annual goodwill impairment test 
if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  or if sparton elects to not perform a qualitative assessment  then the company would be required to perform a quantitative impairment test for goodwill 
a quantitative impairment analysis is a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit  goodwill is considered not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then management will perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then the company would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
when a qualitative impairment assessment is required  sparton determines the fair value of its medical reporting unit  with the assistance of an independent valuation firm  based upon a combination of the income approach discounted cash flow method and market approach market comparable model methodologies 
in concluding on the fair value estimates of its reporting units  the income approach and the market approach are given weighting based on the quality and suitability of information available in performing each approach 
the income approach methodology utilized in estimating the fair value of the company s reporting units for purposes of the goodwill impairment testing requires various judgmental assumptions about revenues  operating margins  growth rates  working capital requirements and appropriate discount rate 
in determining those judgmental assumptions  sparton considers a variety of data  including  for each reporting unit  its annual budget for the upcoming year  its longer term business plan  anticipated future cash flows  market data  and historical cash flow growth rates 
the key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the company s reporting units under the discounted cash flow method are i projected revenue growth over a five year period  ii projected operating margins over a five year period  iii projected terminal growth rate  and iv a weighted average cost of capital 
under the market approach  the value of each of the company s reporting units is estimated by comparing it to publicly traded firms in similar lines of business and geographic markets 
the market approach takes into account  among other things  the market value of total invested capital to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda multiples of comparable companies 
the selected multiples are then applied to the reporting unit s projected ebitda to arrive at an indicated range of value 
based on the company fiscal qualitative assessment of goodwill  the company concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our medical segment was greater than its carrying amount  and therefore no further testing was required 
the company s fiscal annual tests of goodwill related to its single medical reporting unit did not indicate that the related goodwill was impaired 
the company determined at that time that the fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value  having exceeded the carrying values by approximately 
the company s fiscal annual test of goodwill related to its colorado reporting unit similarly did not indicate that the related goodwill was impaired 
the company determined that the fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value  having exceeded its carrying value by approximately 

table of contents the company s fiscal annual test of goodwill related to its ohio reporting unit did indicate that the related goodwill was impaired 
the company determined that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value  requiring sparton to compare the carrying value of this goodwill to its implied fair value  which resulted in a non cash impairment charge of approximately million recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal to reflect this asset at its fair value of million 
the drop in fair value between fiscal and the previous year reflected various downward trends in volume within the company s ohio reporting unit  which was acquired in fiscal  including the impact of a customer disengagement and one customer fiscal fourth quarter notification of its intent to dual source certain programs with us as part of an overall dual sourcing strategy for certain of its critical programs 
the company s assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the medical segment s ohio reporting unit in fiscal reflected the company s outlook at that time for the reporting unit and reflected the effects of the events and uncertainties mentioned above  including but not limited to  lower expected revenues and lower expected operating margins than reflected in the company s prior year goodwill impairment analysis 
determining the fair value of any reporting unit and intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
the company bases its fair value estimates on assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
circumstances that may lead to future impairment of goodwill include  but are not limited to  unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand  as well as further loss of a significant customer or program in excess of future incremental new business wins 
the next annual goodwill impairment review is expected to be performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company s intangible assets other than goodwill represent the values assigned to customer relationships acquired in conjunction with the company s purchases of astro  byers peak  onyx and creonix and values assigned to non compete agreements acquired in conjunction with the company s purchase of onyx 
creonix customer relationships of approximately million are included within the complex systems segment 
all remaining intangible assets are included within the medical segment 
the impairment test for these intangible assets is conducted when impairment indicators are present 
the company continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of its intangible assets warrant revision or that the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable 
the company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows  an impairment charge would be recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
as noted above  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company was notified by one of its larger customers that it intended to dual source two of its larger programs with the company beginning in fiscal this customer was acquired as a customer in conjunction with the company s purchase of astro and as such sparton considered this customer dual sourcing of these two programs to be an impairment indicator requiring impairment review of the related intangible asset 
this impairment review  which was conducted during the fourth quarter of fiscal  concluded that the carrying value of this intangible asset was not fully recoverable and consequently a non cash impairment charge of approximately million was recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal to record this asset at its fair value of million 
the other business events and uncertainties described above in relation to the medical segment s ohio reporting unit were also contributing factors to the astro customer relationship impairment charge 
as part of the impairment review  the estimated remaining useful life of this asset was evaluated with the company determining that no change was warranted 
during fiscal and in previous years  the customer relationships acquired in conjunction with the company s purchase of astro were amortizing on a straight line basis over years 
the straight line method was used to amortize these identified intangible assets because the company believed that the expected undiscounted cash flows were reasonably consistent with a ratable decline in value over time 
beginning in fiscal  the remaining customer relationships acquired in conjunction with the company s purchase of astro are being amortized using an accelerated methodology on its remaining life as the company now believes that this more reasonably reflects the expected future undiscounted cash flows of the asset 
the customer relationships acquired in conjunction with the company s purchase of byers peak  onyx and creonix are also being amortized using an accelerated methodology over ten years 
the company s non compete agreements are being amortized on a straight line basis over one year as the ratable decline in value over time is most consistent with the contractual nature of these assets 

table of contents income taxes we recognize federal  state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction 
we also recognize federal  state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities  as appropriate  for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carry forwards 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
management must also assess whether uncertain tax positions as filed could result in the recognition of a liability for possible interest and penalties if any 
the company has successor tax liability with respect to the onyx shares acquired during the period 
we identified approximately million  net of federal benefit  of uncertain tax positions for certain state income tax liabilities related to periods prior to the business combination 
management made the determination that it was more likely than not that the full benefit of tax positions would not be sustained on examination and accordingly  has established a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million as of june  as of june   management does not expect the amount of the unrecognized tax benefit liability to increase or decrease significantly within the next months 
should the unrecognized tax benefit of million be recognized  the company effective tax rate would be favorably impacted 
our estimates are based on the information available to us at the time we prepare the income tax provisions 
our income tax returns are subject to audit by federal  state  and local governments  generally years after the returns are filed 
these returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws 
our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based  in part  on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome  changes in accounting or tax laws in the united states and overseas  or changes in other facts or circumstances 
in addition  we recognize liabilities for potential united states tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes may be due 
if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment  we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit  or additional income tax expense  respectively  in our consolidated financial statements 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  management assesses the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred income tax assets  management considers all available positive and negative evidence  including operating results  ongoing tax planning and forecasts of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
a valuation allowance is established if we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
stock based compensation asc topic  share based payment  requires significant judgment and the use of estimates in the assumptions for the model used to value the share based payment awards  including stock price volatility  and expected option terms 
in addition  expected forfeiture rates for the share based awards must be estimated 
because of our small number of option grants during our history  we are limited in our historical experience to use as a basis for these assumptions 
while we believe that the assumptions and judgments used in our estimates are reasonable  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions
