item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve significant risks and uncertainties 
as a result of many factors  such as those set forth under risk factors in item a of this annual report on form k  our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview we are an emerging specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development  commercialization and manufacture of proprietary pharmaceutical products  based on our proprietary depofoam drug delivery technology  for use in hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers 
our commercial stage products include exparel and depocyt e 
exparel is a liposome injection of bupivacaine  an amide type local anesthetic  indicated for administration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia and was approved by the united states food and drug administration  or fda  in october it is marketed by our sales force entirely dedicated to commercializing exparel 
we commercially launched exparel in april as a result of our first commercial sale of exparel  we triggered a million payment obligation to skyepharma holding  inc  or skyepharma  in connection with the acquisition of our california operating subsidiary  which we refer to as the acquisition 
depocyt e is a sustained release liposomal formulation of the chemotherapeutic agent cytarabine and is indicated for the intrathecal treatment of lymphomatous meningitis 
depocyt e was granted accelerated approval by the fda in and full approval in we sell depocyt e to our commercial partners located in the us and europe 
initially  through our relationship with quintiles  we outsourced our dedicated exparel field sales force  consisting of approximately representatives 
on january   this field force transitioned from quintiles to pacira 
they are supported by our current marketing team as well as teams of healthcare professionals  including medical affairs  scientific affairs and nursing teams  who support our formulary approval and customer education initiatives 
in july  we received an inspection letter from the mhra noting certain critical and major deficiencies in the depocyt e manufacturing line  which is located in a separate building from the exparel manufacturing site 
as a result of the findings  the european medicines agency issued an assessment report which recommended that  until corrective actions were taken allowing new supply to enter the market  alternative medicines be used in european union member countries where there are suitable alternatives 
the assessment report also recommended a selective recall of depocyt e in european union member countries where depocyt e was not considered to be an essential medicinal product 
we temporarily ceased manufacturing depocyt e in order to implement a remediation plan and address the failures noted in the mhra inspection report 
we completed the implementation of our remediation plan and  in december  the mhra re inspected our depocyt e manufacturing facility to review progress in the implementation of our remediation commitments arising from the july inspection 
we received notice in january from the mhra that our remediation efforts were successful and that we could resume production of depocyt e for sale in europe 
we advised the fda of the mhra inspectional findings after we received the july inspection report  and the fda indicated it had no issue with continued distribution of depocyt e in the us market pending our remediation efforts 
we plan to resume production of depocyt e for sales in europe and the united states in the first quarter of 
table of contents the selective recall contributed to a reduction in product sales and royalty revenue of depocyt e in the second half of though we do not expect new depocyt e product to be available to the european market until the second quarter of  we do not currently expect an out of stock situation in either the united states or europe as a result of the interruption in manufacturing of depocyt e 
we also partner with other companies who desire access to our proprietary depofoam extended release drug delivery technology to conduct research  feasibility and formulation work with their products 
on december  we entered into an exclusive license  development and commercialization agreement and related supply agreement with aratana therapeutics  inc  or aratana 
under the agreements  we granted aratana an exclusive royalty bearing license  including the limited right to grant sublicenses  for the development and commercialization of our bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension product for animal health indications 
under the agreement  aratana will develop and seek approval for the use of the product in veterinary surgery to manage postsurgical pain  focusing initially on developing it for cats  dogs and other companion animals 
in connection with its entry into the agreement  we received a one time payment of million and are eligible to receive up to an additional aggregate million upon the achievement of development and commercial milestones 
once the product has been approved by the food and drug administration for sale in the united states  aratana will pay us a tiered double digit royalty on net sales made in the united states 
if the product is approved by foreign regulatory agencies for sale outside of the united states  aratana will pay us a tiered double digit royalty on such net sales 
royalty rates will be reduced by a certain percentage upon the entry of a generic competitor for animal health indications into a jurisdiction or if aratana must pay royalties to third parties under certain circumstances 
on june   we received a notice of termination from novo nordisk as  or novo  of a development and license agreement  dated january  pursuant to the terms of the agreement  the termination of the agreement is effective days from the date of the notice  or august  under the agreement  we granted exclusive rights to novo under certain of our patents and know how to develop  manufacture and commercialize formulations of a novo proprietary drug using our depofoam drug delivery technology 
the agreement was terminated due to novo decision to discontinue development of the proprietary drug subject to the agreement 
as a result  our future collaborative licensing and development revenue may be negatively impacted 
on january   ekr therapeutics  inc  or ekr  delivered a notice to us to terminate the licensing  distribution and marketing agreement relating to depodur 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  the termination of the agreement was effective days from the date of the notice  or july  the associated supply agreement also terminated concurrently with the termination of the licensing  distribution and marketing agreement 
both parties agreed to terminate the agreements effective june  as a result of the termination  we recognized any unamortized deferred revenue relating to the agreement on a straight line basis through the termination date in june the nda for depodur was also withdrawn and we do not expect any future depodur sales 
since inception  we have incurred significant operating losses 
we expect to continue to incur significant expenses as we commercialize exparel and advance the development of product candidates  seek fda approval for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials and develop our sales force and marketing capabilities to prepare for their commercial launch 
we also expect to incur additional expenses to add operational  financial and management information systems and personnel  including personnel to support our product development efforts and our obligations as a public reporting company 
for us to become and remain profitable  we believe that we must succeed in commercializing exparel or other product candidates with significant market potential 

table of contents recent developments convertible notes on january   we completed a private offering of million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due  or notes  and entered into an indenture with wells fargo bank  national association  a national banking association  as trustee  governing the notes 
the net proceeds from the offering  including net proceeds from the exercise in full by the initial purchasers of their option to purchase an additional million in aggregate principal amount of the notes  are approximately million  after deducting the initial purchasers discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses payable by us 
the notes accrue interest at per year  payable semiannually in arrears on february and august of each year  beginning on august  and will mature on february  we used million of the net proceeds from the offering of the notes to repay in full our million credit facility with oxford finance llc 
in connection with such termination  we paid the remaining principal amount of million as well as accrued interest  certain prepayment fees and an end of term charge in the aggregate amount of million 
financial operations overview revenue our net product sales are derived of exparel  which we commercially launched in april in the united states  and depocyt e  which we sell to commercial partners in the united states and europe 
we ship exparel directly to the end user based on orders placed to wholesalers or directly to us and have no product held by wholesalers 
we reported exparel product sales of million for the year ended december   which is net of allowances for sales returns  prompt pay discounts  volume rebates and distribution service fees payable to wholesalers 
depocyt e net product sales of million for the year ended december  were derived from a contractual price on shipments to our commercial partners 
we also generate collaborative licensing and development revenue from our collaborations with third parties who seek to use our depofoam technology to develop extended release formulations of their products and product candidates 
royalties are recognized as the product is sold by our commercial partners and are calculated as a percentage of the net selling price  which is typically net of discounts  returns  and allowances incurred by our commercial partners  net of the agreed upon supply price 
cost of revenues our cost of revenues consists of the costs associated with our products sold and research and development services provided to our collaboration partners and include the following manufacturing overhead and fixed costs associated with running two cgmp manufacturing facilities  including allocated rent  utilities  insurance  depreciation and salaries and related costs of personnel involved with our manufacturing activities  cost of active pharmaceutical ingredients  royalties due to third parties on our revenues  packaging  testing  and freight  amortization of our intangible assets  regulatory and pharmacovigilance costs  and 
table of contents cost associated with excess manufacturing capacity and any non routine shutdown of our facilities  which are charged to cost of revenue as incurred 
our cost of revenues increased significantly following fda approval of exparel in october  when we shifted exparel manufacturing expenses on a prospective basis from research and development to cost of revenues 
research and development expenses our historical research and development expenses primarily consist of expenses incurred in developing  testing  manufacturing and seeking regulatory approval of exparel  including expenses associated with regulatory submissions  clinical trials and manufacturing  including additional expenses to prepare for the commercial manufacture of exparel prior to fda approval  payments to third party contract research organizations  contract laboratories and independent contractors  payments made to consultants who perform research and development on our behalf and assist us in the preparation of regulatory filings  personnel related expenses  such as salaries  benefits  travel and other related expenses  including stock based compensation  payments made to third party investigators who perform research and development on our behalf and clinical sites where such research and development is conducted  and allocated rent and utilities  depreciation and amortization  and other related expenses 
clinical trial expenses for our product candidates are a significant component of our current research and development expenses 
product candidates in later stage clinical development  generally have higher research and development expenses than those in earlier stages of development  primarily due to the increased size and duration of the clinical trials 
we coordinate clinical trials through a number of contracted investigational sites and recognize the associated expense based on a number of factors  including actual and estimated subject enrollment and visits  direct pass through costs and other clinical site fees 
from the acquisition date through december   we incurred research and development expenses of million  of which million is related to the development of exparel 
we expect to incur additional research and development expenses as we accelerate the development of exparel in additional indications 
in we began two pivotal nerve block studies  an intercostal block study in posterolateral thoracotomy patients and a femoral nerve block in total knee arthroplasty tka patients 
we expect the studies to be completed in  and we expect to file an snda in completion of clinical trials may take several years or more and the length of time generally varies according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product candidate 
we are currently unable to determine our future research and development expenses related to exparel because the requirements of any additional clinical trials of exparel for additional indications have yet to be determined 
for example  the fda has required that we complete a post approval clinical trial for exparel in pediatric patients 
the cost of clinical development may vary significantly due to factors such as the scope  rate of progress  expense and outcome of our clinical trials and other development activities 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and other related costs  including stock based compensation  for personnel serving in our sales and marketing  executive  finance  legal  information technology  compliance and human resource functions 
our selling  general and administrative expenses also include facility and related costs  professional fees for legal  patent expenses  consulting  tax and accounting services  insurance  depreciation and general corporate expenses 
our selling  general and administrative costs have increased significantly since we have focused significant resources on building our commercial team for the launch and commercial sale of exparel 
following approval of exparel in october  we hired and trained our quintiles sales force which is comprised of approximately representatives  which we transitioned as our employees on january  we also ran prospective outcome studies designed for commercial purposes  which do not have any regulatory endpoints and are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
we expect to continue to incur significant selling  general and administrative expenses as we continue to execute our marketing and sales strategies for exparel and implement a variety of marketing programs to educate customers about exparel 
interest income expense interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest expense primarily consists of cash and non cash interest costs related to our debt holdings 
we capitalize interest based on the construction costs for our expanded exparel suite c manufacturing line 
during and  we also incurred interest expense associated with our secured and unsecured notes issued to certain of our investors that converted into common stock upon completion of our initial public offering and negotiated rent deferral payments 
royalty interest obligation our royalty interest obligation is due under an amended and restated royalty interests assignment agreement  further discussed in liquidity and capital resources  which provides paul capital a right to receive an interest in end user sales relating to depocyt e and depodur 
the obligations under the agreement are composed of i the difference in the revaluation of our obligations between each reporting period and ii the actual royalty interest payments payable for such reporting period 
we record our royalty interest obligation as a liability in our consolidated balance sheets in accordance with asc  sales of future revenues 
we impute interest expense associated with this liability using the effective interest rate method 
the effective interest rate may vary during the term of the agreement depending on a number of factors including the actual sales of depocyt e and depodur and a significant estimation  performed quarterly  of certain of our future cash flows related to these products during the remaining term of the amended and restated royalty interests assignment agreement which terminates on december  the effect of the change in the estimates is reflected in our consolidated statements of operations as royalty interest obligation 
in addition  such cash flows are subject to foreign exchange movements related to sales of depocyt e and depodur denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates we have based our management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted 
table of contents accounting principles  or gaap  in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to clinical trial expenses and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully discussed in note to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this filing  we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition net product sales we sell exparel to wholesalers based on orders of the product from hospitals and other end user customers such as ambulatory surgery centers and doctors 
we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  title has passed  collection is reasonably assured and the price is fixed or determinable 
sales to wholesalers provide for selling prices that are fixed on the date of sale 
exparel is delivered directly to the end user with the wholesaler never taking physical possession of the product 
we record revenue at the time the product is delivered to the end user 
we also recognize revenue from products manufactured and supplied to commercial partners 
prior to the shipment of the manufactured products  we conduct initial product release and stability testing in accordance with our current good manufacturing practices or cgmp 
at the time we recognize revenue  we also record certain sales reserves and allowances as a reduction of revenue 
these reserves and allowances include a prompt payment reserve  return reserves  volume rebates  chargeback reserve and wholesaler service fee 
due to estimates and assumptions inherent in determining some of our sales reserves  the actual amount of volume rebates  chargebacks and returns may be different from our estimates  at which time we would adjust our reserves accordingly 
prompt pay reserve the prompt payment reserve is based upon discounts offered to wholesalers as an incentive to meet certain payment terms 
we account for these discounts at the time the sale is made and reduce accounts receivable accordingly 
returns reserve we allow customers to return product that is damaged or received in error 
in addition  we allow for product to be returned beginning six months prior to  and twelve months following product expiration 
as exparel is a new commercially available product  we are estimating our sales return reserve based on return history from other hospital based products with similar distribution models  which we believe is the best estimate of the anticipated product to be returned 
the returns reserve is recorded at the time of sale as a reduction to sales and an increase in returns liability 
our commercial partners can return the products within contracted specified timeframes if the products do not meet the applicable inspection tests 
we estimate our return reserves based on our experience with historical return rates 
historically  our product returns have not been material 

table of contents volume rebates and chargeback reserve volume rebates and chargeback reserve are based upon contracted discounts and promotional offers we provide to certain end users such as members of group purchasing organizations 
the volume rebates and chargeback reserve are recorded as a reduction to sales and a customer payable and reduction to receivables  respectively 
wholesaler service fee our customers include major and regional wholesalers with whom we have contracted a fee for service based on a percentage of sales 
this fee for service is recorded as a reduction to gross sales and a liability is established at the time the sale is recorded based on the contracted percentage 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate accounts receivable to determine if a provision for an allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate 
our sales are mostly to established customers 
royalty revenue we recognize revenue from royalties based on our commercial partners net sales of products 
royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with contract terms when they can be reasonably estimated and collectability is reasonably assured 
our commercial partners are obligated to report their net product sales and the resulting royalty due to us within days from the end of each quarter 
based on historical product sales  royalty receipts and other relevant information  we accrue royalty revenue each quarter and subsequently true up our royalty revenue when we receive royalty reports from our commercial partners 
collaborative licensing and development revenue we recognize revenue from reimbursement received in connection with feasibility studies and development work for third parties who desire to utilize our depofoam extended release drug delivery technology for their products  when our contractual services are performed  provided collectability is reasonably assured 
our principal costs under these agreements include costs for our personnel conducting research and development  and our allocated overhead  as well as research and development performed by outside contractors or consultants 
we recognize revenues from non refundable up front license fees received under collaboration agreements ratably over the performance period as determined under the collaboration agreement estimated development period in the case of development agreements  and contract period or longest patent life in the case of supply and distribution agreements 
if the estimated performance period is subsequently modified  we will modify the period over which the up front license fee is recognized accordingly on a prospective basis 
upon notification of the termination of a collaboration agreement  any remaining non refundable license fees received by us  which had been deferred  are recognized over the remaining contractual term 
if the termination is immediate and no additional services are to be performed  the deferred revenue is generally recognized in full 
all such recognized revenues are included in collaborative licensing and development revenue in our consolidated statements of operations 
we recognize revenue from milestone payments received under collaboration agreements when earned  provided that the milestone event is substantive  its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  we have no further performance obligations relating to the event  and collectability is reasonably assured 
if these criteria are not met  we recognize milestone payments 
table of contents ratably over the remaining period of our performance obligations under the applicable collaboration agreement 
research and development expenses we expense all research and development costs as incurred 
we rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical and clinical studies and to provide services  including data management  statistical analysis and electronic compilation for our clinical trials 
we track and record information regarding third party research and development expenses for each study or trial that we conduct and recognize these expenses based on the estimated progress towards completion at the end of each reporting period 
factors we consider in preparing these estimates include the number of subjects enrolled in studies  milestones achieved and other criteria related to the efforts of our vendors 
historically  any adjustments we have made to these assumptions have not been material 
depending on the timing of payments to vendors and estimated services provided  we may record prepaid or accrued expenses related to these costs 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation by measuring and recognizing compensation expense for all stock based awards based on estimated grant date fair values 
we use the straight line method to allocate compensation cost to reporting periods over each optionee requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
we estimate the fair value of our stock based awards using the black scholes option valuation model  or black scholes model 
the black scholes model requires the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility  the calculation of expected term and the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant  among other inputs 
the following table summarizes our assumptions used in the black scholes model year ended december  expected dividend yield none none none risk free interest rate expected volatility expected life of options years years years expected volatility the expected volatility rate used to value stock option grants is based on volatilities of a peer group of similar companies whose share prices are publicly available 
since our initial public offering  we utilize our available historic volatility data combined with the publicly traded peer historic volatility to determine expected volatility over the expected option term 
the peer group was developed based on companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry in a similar stage of development 
expected term we elected to utilize the simplified method for plain vanilla options to estimate the expected term of stock option grants 
under this approach  the weighted average expected life is presumed to be the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option 
risk free interest rate the risk free interest rate assumption was based on zero coupon us department of the treasury instruments that had terms consistent with the expected term of our stock option grants 
expected dividend yield we have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 

table of contents results of operations comparison of years ended december   and revenues the following table provides information regarding our revenues during the periods indicated  including changes as a percentage dollar amounts in thousands year ended december  versus versus increase decrease net product sales exparel  n a n a depocyt e depodur total net product sales collaborative licensing and development revenue royalty revenue total revenues total revenues increased million  or  in the year ended december  as compared to net product sales increased million  or  in the year ended december  as compared to in april  we commercially launched exparel resulting in million of net product sales during we report product sales net of allowances for sales returns  prompt pay discounts  volume rebates and distribution service fees payable to wholesalers 
we ship products directly to the end user based on orders placed to wholesalers or directly to us and have no product held by wholesalers 
the increase in exparel product sales was partially offset by a million decrease in depocyt e product sales primarily driven by a selective recall of depocyt e recommended by the european medicines agency for european union member countries where depocyt e is not considered to be an essential medicinal product 
the increase in collaborative licensing and development revenue of million  or  in the year ended december  as compared to was primarily driven by the recognition of deferred revenue in connection with the termination of certain licensing agreements  which included increases of i million for ekr  ii million for novo nordisk and iii million for flynn pharma 
we recognized any unamortized deferred revenue related to any milestones received under these agreements over the remaining contract periods  which ended in royalty revenue decreased million  or  in the year ended december  as compared to due to lower end user sales by our commercial partners due to the selective recall of depocyt e in europe 
total revenues increased million  or  in the year ended december  as compared to this increase was attributable to a million increase in collaborative licensing and development revenue primarily due to activities performed under the novo agreement  which was signed in january during  we received an up front one time payment of million and a milestone payment of million from novo  which were both deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the expected contract period 
this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in net product sales due to the lower number of depodur lots sold to our commercial partners

we have a substantial level of infrastructure cost relating to running two cgmp facilities and any extended or non routine shutdown results in these costs being charged directly to cost of goods sold 
cost of collaborative licensing and development revenue decreased by million in the year ended december  as compared to due to decreased services performed under the novo agreement for which we received a notice of termination in june total cost of revenues increased million  or in the year ended december  as compared to the increase was primarily driven by excess capacity relating to running two cgmp facilities that have a substantial level of infrastructure cost  including the exparel production line which went into service during the fourth quarter of with all operating costs expensed as incurred due to commercial manufacturing challenges 
additionally  the total cost of collaborative licensing and development increased million due to activities performed under the novo agreement 
research and development expenses the following table provides information regarding research and development expenses during the periods indicated  including changes as a percentage dollar amounts in thousands year ended december  versus versus increase decrease research and development research and development expenses decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to  due to the shift of million in exparel related manufacturing development expenses to cost of goods sold following the approval of exparel by the fda in october this decrease was partially offset by an increase of million on clinical development primarily for the initiation of our phase pivotal trial of exparel administered as a single dose injection femoral nerve block for total knee arthroplasty surgery  in which the first patient was dosed in september  and start up costs for our phase pivotal trial of exparel for 
table of contents intercostal nerve block for thoracotomy 
we also had an increase of million of research and development expenses on a potential new manufacturing process for exparel  which is in pre clinical stage 
research and development expenses decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to primarily due to a million decrease in third party clinical trials and regulatory costs 
this decrease is related to the close out of our pivotal phase placebo controlled studies in exparel and nda preparation costs in additional cost reductions resulted from the shift in expenses from research and development to cost of revenues upon the approval of exparel in the fourth quarter of this reduction was partially offset by a million increase in compensation costs  including stock based compensation and bonus accrual  which were not present in  and an increase in exparel pre commercial manufacturing related costs 
in the years ended december   and  research and development expenses attributable to exparel were million  or  million  or  and million  or of total research and development expenses  respectively 
the research and development expenses not attributable to exparel relate to our product candidate initiatives  including deponsaid and depomethotrexate

table of contents total other expense  net decreased by million  or  to million in the year ended december  as compared to million in  primarily due to a million decrease in interest expense 
the decrease in interest expense is mostly due to the following million increase in capitalized interest mostly related to our suite c manufacturing expansion project  million decrease in warrant expense recognized during the first quarter of in connection with the conversion of these warrants upon our initial public offering  and million decrease in interest expense associated with our and convertible and secured debt facilities which were converted to common shares in connection with our initial public offering in the first quarter of additionally  the decrease in interest expense was offset by a million loss on the extinguishment of our hercules credit facility in may we recognized a million increase in royalty interest obligation expense due to a forecast reduction in end user depocyt e sales that occurred in based on plateauing sales trends for depocyt e  the weakening euro exchange rate and termination of the ekr agreement 
total other expense  net decreased by million  or  to million in the year ended december  as compared to interest expense  net increased million  or  in the year ended december  as compared to primarily due to million of amortization of the remaining value of the warrants and beneficial conversion feature associated with the convertible notes we issued in due to the conversion of these notes into shares of our common stock upon the closing of our initial public offering in february this was partially offset by interest capitalized for the construction of our manufacturing site for exparel 
royalty interest obligation decreased million  or  in the year ended december  as compared to due primarily to changes in forecasted sales projections based on plateauing sales trends for depocyt e and the weakening euro exchange rate 
additionally  the royalty interest obligation was further reduced due to the expected decrease in depodur sales as a result of the termination of the ekr license agreement 
we recorded a million loss on extinguishment of debt during the year ended december  related to the repayment of a million credit facility  established with ge capital corporation in april although the facility was established originally for a period of years  we elected to repay the debt in full in november  from proceeds of a new term loan  established with hercules technology growth capital  inc in november the amount represented the final payment fees and the balance of deferred financing cost which were written off when the debt was paid off 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception in  we have devoted most of our cash resources to manufacturing  research and development and selling  general and administrative activities primarily related to the development of exparel 
we have financed our operations primarily with the proceeds from the sale of convertible preferred stock and common stock  secured and unsecured notes and borrowings under debt facilities  product sales  collaborative licensing and development revenue and royalty revenue 
in april  we sold  shares of common stock at a price of per share in a registered public offering  which includes the underwriter exercise of the overallotment option 
we raised approximately million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses 

table of contents we have generated limited revenue  and we are highly dependent on the commercial success of exparel  which we commercially launched in april we have incurred losses and generated negative cash flows from operations since inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million  cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments of million and working capital of million 
the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for the years ended december    and in thousands year ended december  consolidated statement of cash flows data net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities for the years ended december   and  our net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million  respectively 
the million increase in net cash used in operations in as compared to was primarily driven by i higher selling  marketing and administrative expenses driven by the launch of exparel in april including the hiring of our sales force dedicated to exparel and our phase and retrospective studies  ii increased manufacturing costs and an increase in inventory in connection with our commercial launch of exparel  and iii initiation of our phase exparel nerve block trial in total knee arthroplasty and our phase nerve block trial in thoracotomy

we used the proceeds from the oxford loan to repay the term loan under the hercules credit facility in may royalty interests assignment agreement on march   we entered into the amended and restated royalty interests assignment agreement with paul capital  pursuant to which we assigned to paul capital the right to receive up to approximately of our royalty payments from depocyt e and depodur 
the original agreement was entered into prior to the acquisition by the predecessor in order to monetize certain royalty payments from depocyt e and depodur 
in connection with the acquisition  the original agreement with paul capital was amended and restated and the responsibility to pay the royalty interest in product sales of depocyt e and depodur was transferred to us and we were required to make payments to paul capital upon the occurrence of certain events 
to secure our obligations to paul capital  we granted paul capital a security interest in collateral which includes the royalty payments we are entitled to receive with respect to sales of depocyt e and depodur  as well as to bank accounts to which such payments are deposited 
under our arrangement with paul capital  upon the occurrence of certain events  including if we experience a change of control  undergo certain bankruptcy events of us or our subsidiary  transfer any or substantially all of our rights in depocyt e and or depodur  transfer all or substantially all of our assets  breach certain of the covenants  representations or warranties under the amended and restated royalty interests assignment agreement  or sales of depocyt e and or depodur are suspended due to an injunction or if we elect to suspend sales of depocyt e and or depodur as a result of a lawsuit filed by certain third parties  paul capital may require us to repurchase the rights we assigned to it at a cash price equal to a of all cumulative payments made by us to paul capital under the amended and restated royalty interests assignment agreement during the preceding months  multiplied by b the number of days from the date of paul capital exercise of such option until december   divided by under the terms of the amended and restated royalty interests assignment agreement  our initial public offering did not constitute a change of control 
future capital requirements we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and revenue from product sales  including the proceeds from the issuance of million of convertible notes in january  will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses  capital expenditure requirements and service our indebtedness for at least the next months 
however  no assurance can be given that this will be the case  and we may require additional debt or equity financing to meet our working capital requirements 
our need for additional external sources of funds will depend significantly on the level and timing of our sales of exparel 
moreover  changing circumstances may cause us to expend cash significantly faster than we currently anticipate  and we may need to spend more cash than currently expected because of circumstances beyond our control 
our expectations regarding future cash requirements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions  mergers  dispositions  joint ventures or investments that we make in the future 
we have no current understandings  agreements or commitments for any material acquisitions or licenses of any products  businesses or technologies 
we may need to raise substantial additional capital in order to engage in any of these types of transactions 
we expect to continue to incur substantial additional operating losses as we commercialize exparel and develop and seek regulatory approval for our other product candidates 
we will incur significant sales and marketing and manufacturing expenses due to the commercialization of exparel 
in addition  we expect to incur additional expenses to add operational  financial and information systems and personnel  including personnel to support our planned product commercialization efforts 
we also 
table of contents expect to incur significant costs to comply with corporate governance  internal controls and similar requirements applicable to us as a public company 
our future use of operating cash and capital requirements will depend on many forward looking factors  including the following our ability to successfully commercialize exparel  the costs of our commercialization activities for exparel  the cost and timing of expanding our manufacturing facilities and purchasing manufacturing and other capital equipment for exparel and our other product candidates  the costs of performing additional clinical trials for exparel  including the pediatric trials required by the fda as a condition of approval and the two phase nerve block trials  the scope  progress  results and costs of development for additional indications for exparel and for our other product candidates  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory review of our other product candidates  the extent to which we acquire or invest in products  businesses and technologies  the extent to which we choose to establish collaboration  co promotion  distribution or other similar agreements for our product candidates  and the costs of preparing  submitting and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining  enforcing and defending intellectual property claims 
to the extent that our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future operating and capital requirements  we will need to finance our cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings  corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements or other financing alternatives 
the covenants under the amended and restated royalty interests assignment agreement may limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing 
we have no committed external sources of funds 
additional equity or debt financing or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our stockholders will experience dilution 
debt financing  if available  would result in increased fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions  such as incurring additional debt  making capital expenditures or declaring dividends 
any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms  such as liquidation and other preferences that are not favorable to us or our stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties  it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies  future revenue streams or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  except for operating leases  or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities
