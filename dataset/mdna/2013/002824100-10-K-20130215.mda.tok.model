item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial review abbott revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short term receivable arrangements 
patent protection and licenses  technological and performance features  and inclusion of abbott products under a contract or by a pharmacy benefit manager most impact which products are sold  price controls  competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products  and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs 
abbott primary products are nutritional products  prescription pharmaceuticals  diagnostic testing products and vascular products 
in october  abbott announced a plan to separate into two publicly traded companies  one in diversified medical products and the other in research based pharmaceuticals 
to accomplish the separation  abbott created a new company  abbvie inc abbvie for its research based pharmaceuticals business which consists primarily of abbott proprietary pharmaceutical products segment 
on january   abbott distributed all of the outstanding shares of abbvie to abbott shareholders 
as a result of the distribution  abbvie is now an independent company trading under the symbol abbv 
beginning in the first quarter of  the historical results of the research based pharmaceuticals business will be reflected in abbott consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations 
prior to the separation of abbvie  sales in international markets were approximately percent of consolidated net sales 
post separation  sales outside the us are expected to comprise approximately percent of net sales 
continued robust growth of humira in a broad range of indications  the acquisitions of solvay pharmaceuticals business solvay pharmaceuticals and piramal healthcare limited healthcare solutions business  sales growth and margin improvement in the nutritional and diagnostics businesses  a government investigation of abbott sales and marketing activities related to depakote  and the challenging economic and fiscal environment in many countries around the world have impacted abbott sales  costs and financial position over the last three years 
pharmaceutical research and development was focused over the last three years on therapeutic areas that included immunology  oncology  neuroscience  pain management  hepatitis c hcv  chronic kidney disease and women health 
in addition  abbott acquired the rights to various in process pharmaceutical research and development projects including the development of second generation oral antioxidant inflammation modulators and an oral  next generation jak inhibitor with the potential to treat multiple autoimmune diseases 
in  abbott began the worldwide launch of humira for rheumatoid arthritis  followed by launches for six additional indications in the us and eight additional indications in the european union 
humira worldwide sales increased to billion in compared to billion in  and billion in generic competition for tricor began in the fourth quarter of austerity measures implemented by several european countries reduced healthcare spending and affected pharmaceutical pricing over the last three years 
the us proprietary pharmaceuticals business was negatively affected by the us health care reform legislation which resulted in rebate changes beginning in and the payment of an annual fee beginning in in february  abbott acquired solvay pharmaceuticals which provided abbott with a large and complementary portfolio of pharmaceutical products and expanded abbott presence in key global emerging markets 
the acquisition added approximately billion to abbott net sales  primarily outside the us in september  abbott completed the acquisition of piramal healthcare solutions business  propelling abbott to market leadership in the indian pharmaceutical market and further accelerating the company growth in emerging markets 
abbott recorded expense of approximately million in  million in and million in related to the integration of the solvay business and restructuring plans to streamline operations  improve efficiencies and reduce costs primarily in certain solvay sites and functions 
in may  abbott reached resolution of all depakote related federal claims  medicaid related claims with states and the district of columbia  and consumer protection claims with states and the district of columbia 
abbott recorded charges related to this matter of billion in and million in  of which approximately billion was paid in in abbott worldwide nutritional products business  sales were positively impacted by demographics such as an aging population and an increasing rate of chronic disease in developed markets and the rise of a middle class in many emerging markets  as well as by numerous new product introductions that leveraged abbott strong brands 
at the same time  manufacturing and distribution process changes and other cost reductions drove margin improvements across the business 
in abbott worldwide diagnostics business  margin improvement continued to be a key focus and operating margins increased from percent of sales in to percent in over the last three years  abbott continued to build its xience drug eluting stent franchise with the receipt of approval to market xience xpedition in various countries  including us approval in the fourth quarter of as well as the launches of xience nano and xience prime in the us in  and xience prime and xience v in japan in april and january  respectively 
xience  which includes xience v  prime  nano and xpedition  ended as the market leading drug eluting stent globally 
in  the third party distributor of the promus product began transitioning away from the product and that supply agreement ended in the effect of the winding down of the agreement will continue into the first quarter of in  the us government passed health care reform legislation which included an increase in medicaid rebate rates and the extension of the rebate to drugs provided through medicaid managed care organizations beginning in the legislation also imposed annual fees which pharmaceutical manufacturers began paying in and medical device companies will begin paying in  as well as additional rebates related to the medicare part d donut hole beginning in in addition to a one time charge of approximately million to reduce deferred tax assets associated with retiree health care liabilities related to the medicare part d retiree drug subsidy  the legislation negative impact on abbott performance grew from more than million in to approximately million per year in and the million annual impact included approximately million for the annual pharmaceutical manufacturer fee 
this fee is not tax deductible and is included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
with the separation of abbvie at the beginning of  abbott no longer sells pharmaceutical products in the us and therefore is no longer subject to the annual pharmaceutical fee or the additional rebates 
beginning in  abbott will begin paying the percent medical device tax under us health care reform legislation 
this tax will be included in selling  general and administrative expenses and the amount of the tax is not expected to be material 
in the fourth quarter of  abbott extinguished billion of long term debt and incurred a charge of billion related to the early repayment  net of gains from the unwinding of interest rate swaps related to the debt 
abbott short and long term debt totaled billion at december  this balance includes billion of short borrowings and billion of long term debt that was issued by abbvie inc in after the separation of abbvie on january   abbott has no remaining obligations related to this billion of debt 
at december   abbott long term debt rating was a by standard and poor corporation and a by moody investors service 
operating cash flows in excess of capital expenditures and cash dividends have partially funded acquisitions over the last three years 
in  abbott will focus on several key initiatives 
in the nutritional business  abbott will continue to build its product portfolio with the introduction of new science based products  expand in high growth emerging markets and implement additional margin improvement initiatives 
in the established pharmaceuticals business  which includes international sales of branded generic products  abbott will continue to focus on obtaining additional product approvals across numerous countries and expanding its presence in emerging markets 
in the diagnostics business  abbott will focus on the development of next generation instruments and other advanced technologies  expansion in emerging markets  and further improvements in the segment operating margin 
in the vascular business  abbott will continue to focus on marketing products in the xience and endovascular franchises  increasing international mitraclip sales  and obtaining regulatory review of the mitraclip device in the us as well as further clinical development of absorb  its bioresorbable vascular scaffold bvs device and a further roll out of absorb in numerous countries 
in abbott other segments  abbott will focus on developing differentiated technologies in higher growth markets 
critical accounting policies sales rebates in  approximately percent of abbott consolidated gross revenues were subject to various forms of rebates and allowances that abbott recorded as reductions of revenues at the time of sale 
most of these rebates and allowances are in the proprietary pharmaceutical products segment and the nutritional products segment 
abbott provides rebates to pharmacy benefit management companies  state agencies that administer the federal medicaid program  insurance companies that administer medicare drug plans  state agencies that administer the special supplemental nutrition program for women  infants  and children wic  wholesalers  group purchasing organizations  and other government agencies and private entities 
rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product 
factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate  which customer or government agency price terms apply  and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate 
using historical trends  adjusted for current changes  abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid  and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when abbott records its sale of the product 
settlement of the rebate generally occurs from two to eight months after sale 
abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs 
rebates and chargebacks charged against gross sales in  and amounted to approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively  or percent  percent and percent  respectively  based on gross sales of approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively  subject to rebate 
a one percentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales by approximately million in abbott considers a one percentage point increase to be a reasonably likely increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales 
other allowances charged against gross sales were approximately million  million and million for cash discounts in  and  respectively  and million  million and million for returns in  and  respectively 
cash discounts are known within to days of sale  and therefore can be reliably estimated 
returns can be reliably estimated because abbott historical returns are low  and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods 
management analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balances each quarter 
in the domestic nutritional business  management uses both internal and external data available to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel 
management has access to several large customers inventory management data  and for other customers  utilizes data from a third party that measures time on the retail shelf 
these sources allow management to make reliable estimates of inventory in the distribution channel 
except for a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the wic business in a state  inventory in the distribution channel does not vary substantially 
management also estimates the states processing lag time based on claims data 
in addition  internal processing time is a factor in estimating the accrual 
in the wic business  the state where the sale is made  which is the determining factor for the applicable price  is reliably determinable 
estimates are required for the amount of wic sales within each state where abbott has the wic business 
external data sources utilized for that estimate are participant data from the us department of agriculture usda  which administers the wic program  participant data from some of the states  and internally administered market research 
the usda has been making its data available for many years 
internal data includes historical redemption rates and pricing data 
at december   abbott had wic business in states 
in the domestic proprietary pharmaceutical business  the most significant charges against gross sales are for medicaid and medicare rebates  pharmacy benefit manager rebates and wholesaler chargebacks 
in order to evaluate the adequacy of the ending accrual balances  management uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time 
external data sources used to estimate the inventory in the distribution channel include inventory levels periodically reported by wholesalers and third party market data purchased by abbott 
management estimates the processing lag time based on periodic sampling of claims data 
to estimate the price rebate percentage  systems and calculations are used to track sales by product by customer and to estimate the contractual or statutory price 
abbott systems and calculations have developed over time as rebates have become more significant  and abbott believes they are reliable 
the following table is an analysis of the four largest rebate accruals  which comprise approximately percent of the consolidated rebate provisions charged against revenues in remaining rebate provisions charged against gross sales are not significant in the determination of operating earnings 
dollars in millions domestic proprietary pharmaceutical products domestic nutritionals wic rebates medicaid and medicare rebates pharmacy benefit manager rebates wholesaler chargebacks balance at january  provisions payments balance at december  provisions payments balance at december  provisions payments balance at december  historically  adjustments to prior years rebate accruals have not been material to net income 
abbott employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it  and where possible  works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts 
for medicaid  medicare and other government agency programs  the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations  which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation 
income taxes abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments 
because abbott operates globally  the nature of the audit items are often very complex  and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country 
abbott employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible 
in accordance with the accounting rules relating to the measurement of tax contingencies  in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit  the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position  and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit 
application of these rules requires a significant amount of judgment 
in the us  abbott federal income tax returns through are settled except for one item  and the income tax returns for years after are open 
abbott does not record deferred income taxes on earnings reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries 
pension and post employment benefits abbott offers pension benefits and post employment health care to many of its employees 
abbott engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under these programs 
abbott must develop long term assumptions  the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates  discount rates and the expected return on plan assets 
the discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on high quality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits 
the health care cost trend rates represent abbott expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and is a forward projection of health care costs as of the measurement date 
a difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates  which will not be known for decades  can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs 
low asset returns due to poor market conditions and low interest rates have significantly increased actuarial losses for these plans 
at december   pretax net actuarial losses and prior service costs and credits recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for abbott defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans were losses of billion and million  respectively 
actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method  in accordance with the rules for accounting for post employment benefits 
differences between the expected long term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a five year period 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the impact of a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate  however  there can be no certainty that a change would be limited to only one percentage point 
valuation of intangible assets abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that abbott records at fair value 
transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows  risk  the cost of capital  terminal values and market participants 
each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset 
abbott engages independent valuation experts who review abbott critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles 
abbott reviews definite lived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach 
if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset  the intangible asset is written down to its fair value  which is usually the discounted cash flow amount 
where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset  the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  which relate to in process research and development acquired in a business combination  are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs 
at december   goodwill and intangibles amounted to billion and billion  respectively  and amortization expense for intangible assets amounted to billion in there were no impairments of goodwill in  or in and  abbott recorded impairment charges of million and million  respectively  for certain research and development assets due to changes in the projected development and regulatory timelines for the projects 
litigation abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification no 
 contingencies 
under asc no 
 loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management best estimate of a loss  or when a best estimate cannot be made  a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded 
these estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known  and the estimates are refined each accounting period as additional information becomes known 
accordingly  abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss  and therefore the minimum amount  which could be zero  is recorded 
as information becomes known  either the minimum loss amount is increased  resulting in additional loss provisions  or a best estimate can be made  also resulting in additional loss provisions 
occasionally  a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected 
abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately million to million for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures 
accruals of approximately million have been recorded at december  for these proceedings and exposures 
these accruals represent management best estimate of probable loss  as defined by fasb asc no

international pediatric and adult nutritionals sales increases over the three years were due primarily to volume growth in developing countries and were negatively impacted in by the effect of the relatively stronger us dollar 
the increases in us proprietary product sales in and are primarily due to increased sales of humira and the acquisition of solvay pharmaceuticals in february  partially offset by decreased sales of depakote  zemplar  and kaletra 
the increases in established pharmaceutical sales in and are primarily due to the acquisitions of solvay pharmaceuticals and piramal and growth in emerging markets 
us pediatric nutritionals sales in and were affected by the voluntary recall of certain similac brand powder infant formulas in september and the subsequent recovery in market share in international proprietary pharmaceuticals  international adult nutritionals and immunochemistry sales were positively impacted by the effect of the relatively weaker us dollar in and abbott has periodically sold product rights to non strategic products and has recorded the related gains in net sales in accordance with abbott revenue recognition policies as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
related net sales were approximately million in  while there were no significant sales in and the expiration of licenses and patent protection and generic competition can affect the future revenues and operating income of abbott 
there are currently no significant patent or license expirations in the next three years that are expected to affect abbott after the separation of abbvie

the increase in the gross profit margin in was due  in part  to improved margins in the established pharmaceutical  vascular  diabetes  diagnostics and nutritional businesses and the favorable effect of exchange on the gross profit margin ratio 
in the us  states receive price rebates from manufacturers of infant formula under the federally subsidized special supplemental nutrition program for women  infants  and children 
there are also rebate programs for pharmaceutical products in numerous countries 
these rebate programs continue to have a negative effect on the gross profit margins of the nutritional  proprietary pharmaceutical and established pharmaceutical products segments

the majority of research and development expenditures over the three years were concentrated on pharmaceutical products 
billion of abbott research and development expenses related to abbott pharmaceutical products  of which billion was directly allocated to the proprietary pharmaceutical products segment 
in  research and development expenditures totaled million for the vascular products segment  million for the diagnostics products segment  million for the established pharmaceutical products segment and million for the nutritional products segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased percent in and increased percent in and percent in includes approximately million related to the separation of abbvie from abbott and a million litigation charge related to the government investigation related to depakote while includes a litigation charge of billion related to the depakote investigation

this increase  exclusive of the effects of the restructuring and integration charges  reflects the acquisitions of solvay pharmaceuticals business in and advanced medical optics  inc in and higher provisions for litigation in the remaining increases in selling  general and administrative expenses over the three year period were due primarily to increased selling and marketing support for new and existing products  including continued spending for humira  inflation  and in  the impact of the pharmaceutical fee imposed by us healthcare reform legislation 
restructurings in  abbott management approved plans to streamline various commercial operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in abbott core diagnostics  established pharmaceutical and nutritionals businesses 
abbott recorded employee related severance charges of approximately million in additional charges of approximately million were also recorded in  primarily for asset impairments 
approximately million is recorded in cost of products sold and approximately million as selling  general and administrative expense 
as of december   no significant cash payments have been made relating to these actions 
in and prior years  abbott management approved plans to realign its worldwide pharmaceutical and vascular manufacturing operations and selected domestic and international commercial and research and development operations in order to reduce costs

change in accounting principle and other income expense  net prior to january   the accounts of foreign subsidiaries were consolidated based on a fiscal year ended november due to the time needed to consolidate these subsidiaries 
effective january   the one month lag in the consolidation of the accounts of foreign subsidiaries was eliminated and the year end of foreign subsidiaries was changed to december abbott believes that the change in accounting principle related to the elimination of the one month reporting lag is preferable because it results in more contemporaneous reporting of the results of foreign subsidiaries 
in accordance with applicable accounting literature  a change in subsidiaries year end is treated as a change in accounting principle and requires retrospective application 
the cumulative effect of the change was an increase in retained earnings of million as of january  and a corresponding decrease in other long term liabilities 
the impact of the change was not material to the results of operations for the previously reported annual and interim periods after january   and thus  those results have not been revised 
a charge of million was recorded to other income expense  net in to recognize the cumulative immaterial impacts to and had the financial statements been revised  net sales  operating earnings and net earnings in would have decreased by million  million and million  respectively

taxes on earnings in reflect the effect of the tax rate applied to a litigation reserve and the recognition of million of tax benefits as a result of the favorable resolution of various tax positions pertaining to prior years  which also decreased the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits by approximately billion 
exclusive of these discrete items  the effective rates are lower than the us federal statutory rate of percent due primarily to the benefit of lower foreign tax rates and tax exemptions that reduced the tax rates by   and percentage points in  and  respectively 
the tax rate reductions are primarily derived from operations in puerto rico  switzerland  ireland and singapore where abbott benefits from a combination of favorable statutory tax rules  tax rulings  grants  and exemptions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a full reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate 
as a result of the american taxpayer relief act of signed into law in january  abbott expects to record a tax benefit of approximately million in the first quarter of for the retroactive extension of the research tax credit and the look through rules of section c of the internal revenue code to the beginning of excluding this and any other discrete items  abbott expects to apply an annual effective rate of approximately percent 
as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act which were signed into law in  abbott recorded a charge of approximately million in to reduce deferred tax assets associated with retiree health care liabilities related to the medicare part d retiree drug subsidy 
in october  puerto rico enacted legislation that assesses a tax beginning in on certain products manufactured in puerto rico 
the tax is levied on gross intercompany purchases from puerto rican entities and is included in inventory costs 
in and  cost of goods sold included million and million  respectively  related to this tax 
the tax is creditable for us income tax purposes 
research and development programs abbott currently has numerous pharmaceutical  medical and nutritional products in development 
research and development process in the proprietary pharmaceuticals segment  the research and development process generally begins with discovery research which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has a desired effect against a given disease 
if preclinical testing of an identified compound proves successful  the compound moves into clinical development which generally includes the following phases phase i involves the first human tests in a small number of healthy volunteers to assess tolerability and potential dosing 
phase ii tests the molecule efficacy against the disease in a small group of patients 
phase iii tests a molecule that demonstrates favorable results in the earlier phases in a significantly larger patient population to further demonstrate efficacy and safety based on regulatory criteria 
the clinical trials from all of the development phases provide the data required to prepare and submit a new drug application nda  a biological license application bla or other submission for regulatory approval to the us food and drug administration fda or similar government agencies outside the us the specific requirements eg  scope of clinical trials for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions 
the research and development process from discovery through a new drug launch typically takes years and can be even longer 
there is a significant amount of uncertainty inherent in the research and development of new pharmaceutical products and there is no guarantee when  or if  a molecule will receive the regulatory approval required to launch a new drug or indication 
in addition to the development of new products and new formulations  proprietary pharmaceutical research and development projects also may include phase iv trials  sometimes called post marketing studies 
for such projects  clinical trials are designed and conducted to collect additional data regarding  among other parameters  the benefits and risks of an approved drug 
in the established pharmaceuticals segment  the development process focuses on the geographic expansion and continuous improvement of the segment existing products to provide benefits to patients and customers 
as established pharmaceuticals does not actively pursue primary research  development usually begins with work on existing products or after the acquisition of an advanced stage licensing opportunity 
depending upon the product  the phases of development may include drug product development phase i bioequivalence studies to compare a future established pharmaceutical brand with an already marketed compound with the same active pharmaceutical ingredient api 
phase ii studies to test the efficacy of benefits in a small group of patients 
phase iii studies to broaden the testing to a wider population that reflects the actual medical use 
phase iv and other post marketing studies to obtain new clinical use data on existing products within approved indications 
the specific requirements eg scope of clinical trials for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions 
the process may range from one year for a bioequivalence study project to or more years for complex formulations  new indications  or geographic expansion in specific countries such as china 
in the diagnostics segment  the phases of the research and development process include discovery which focuses on identification of a product that will address a specific therapeutic area  platform  or unmet clinical need  concept feasibility during which the materials and manufacturing processes are evaluated  testing may include product characterization and analysis is performed to confirm clinical utility  and development during which extensive testing is performed to demonstrate that the product meets specified design requirements and that the design specifications conform to user needs and intended uses 
as with pharmaceutical products  the regulatory requirements for diagnostic products vary across different countries and geographic regions 
in the us  the fda classifies diagnostic products into classes i  ii  or iii and the classification determines the regulatory process for approval 
while the diagnostics segment has products in all three classes  the vast majority of its products are categorized as class i or class ii 
submission of a separate regulatory filing is not required for class i products 
class ii devices typically require pre market notification to the fda through a regulatory filing known as a k submission 
most class iii products are subject to the fda pre marketing approval pma requirements 
other class iii products  such as those used to screen blood  require the submission and approval of a bla 
in the eu  diagnostic products are also categorized into different categories and the regulatory process  which is governed by the european in vitro diagnostic medical device directive  depends upon the category 
certain product categories require review and approval by an independent company  known as a notified body  before the manufacturer can affix a ce mark to the product to show compliance with the directive 
other products only require a self certification process 
in the vascular segment  the research and development process begins with research on a specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability 
if the research program passes that hurdle  it moves forward into development 
the development process includes evaluation and selection of a product design  completion of clinical trials to test the product safety and efficacy  and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate its repeatability and ability to consistently meet pre determined specifications 
similar to the diagnostic products discussed above  in the us  vascular products are classified as class i  ii  or iii 
most of abbott vascular products are classified as class ii devices that follow the k regulatory process or class iii devices that are subject to the pma process 
in the eu  vascular products are also categorized into different classes and the regulatory process  which is governed by the european medical device directive  varies by class 
each product must bear a ce mark to show compliance with the directive 
some products require submission of a design dossier to the appropriate regulatory authority for review and approval prior to ce marking of the device 
for other products  the company is required to prepare a technical file which includes testing results and clinical evaluations but can self certify its ability to apply the ce mark to the product 
outside the us and the eu  the regulatory requirements vary across different countries and regions 
after approval and commercial launch of some vascular products  post market trials may be conducted either due to a conditional requirement of the regulatory market approval or with the objective of proving product superiority 
in the nutritional segment  the research and development process generally focuses on identifying and developing ingredients and products that address the nutritional needs of particular populations eg  infants  athletes or patients eg  people with diabetes 
depending upon the country and or region  if claims regarding a product efficacy will be made  clinical studies typically must be conducted 
most other product development  such as a product form change from liquid to powder  generally does not necessitate clinical studies 
in the us  the fda requires that it be notified of proposed new formulations and formulation or packaging changes related to infant formula products 
prior to the launch of an infant formula or product packaging change  the company is required to obtain the fda confirmation that it has no objections to the proposed product or packaging 
for other nutrition products  notification or pre approval from the fda is not required unless the product includes a new food additive 
in some countries  regulatory approval may be required for certain nutritional products  including infant formula and medical nutritional products 
areas of focus in and beyond  abbott significant areas of therapeutic focus will include the following established pharmaceuticals abbott is actively working on plans for about key brands 
depending on the product  the development activities focus on new data  markets  formulations  combinations  or indications 
abbott focuses on building country specific portfolios made up of global and local pharmaceutical brands that best meet each local market needs 
over the next several years  established pharmaceuticals will work to expand the market for many of its products through registrations across multiple geographies  including key emerging markets

diabetes care in the first quarter of  abbott obtained us regulatory approval for its freestyle insulinx blood glucose monitoring system that includes a touch screen interface and other features designed to support the insulin using patient 
after receiving ce mark for this system in may and health canada approval in october  abbott is continuing to provide r d support as the product is launched in additional markets 
development is also continuing on an updated hospital blood glucose monitoring system for which a filing for approval is projected to be submitted in the us during the first half of abbott is also developing a next generation monitoring system under the precision product platform and for which abbott anticipates submitting filings for approval in various markets in the second half of nutrition abbott is focusing its research and development spend on six benefit platforms that span the pediatric  adult and performance nutrition areas immunity  cognition  lean body mass  inflammation  metabolism and tolerance 
numerous new products that build on advances in these benefit platforms are currently under development and are expected to be launched over the coming years 
given the diversity of abbott business  its intention to remain a broad based healthcare company and the numerous sources for potential future growth  no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations over the next five years 
factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project over the next year relative to abbott total research and development expenses as well as qualitative factors  such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on abbott overall market position 
there were no delays in abbott research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations 
while the aggregate cost to complete the numerous projects currently in development is expected to be material  the total cost to complete will depend upon abbott ability to successfully complete each project  the rate at which each project advances  and the ultimate timing for completion 
given the potential for significant delays and the high rate of failure inherent in the research and development of new pharmaceutical and medical device products and technologies  it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development 
after the separation of abbvie  abbott plans to manage its portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spend equal to approximately percent to percent of sales each year 
abbott does not regularly accumulate or make management decisions based on the total expenses incurred for a particular development phase in a given period

the results of the last impairment test indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value except for the medical optics unit 
while the fair value of the medical optics business exceeds its carrying value  extended economic pressure on government reimbursed cataract procedures in europe and on the global lasik surgery business as well as longer regulatory approval timelines for products currently under development could result in a valuation in the future where the fair value of the medical optics unit has declined below its carrying value  thereby triggering the requirement to estimate the implied fair value of the goodwill and measure for impairment

abbott funded million in  million in and million in to defined pension plans 
abbott expects pension funding for its main domestic pension plan of million in  the decrease primarily reflects the separation of abbvie and the transfer of certain plan assets and liabilities to abbvie 
abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to continue to exceed abbott capital expenditures and cash dividends 
for  the reductions in cash and cash equivalents due to the effect of exchange rate changes was primarily driven by the impact of changes in the value of the us dollar compared to the euro on non dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents

substantially all of abbott trade receivables in italy  spain  portugal  and greece are with governmental health systems 
given the economic conditions and sovereign debt issues in these countries  the time it takes to collect outstanding receivables increased in in  collection times improved relative to with the exception of greece 
outstanding net governmental receivables in these countries at december  were dollars in millions net receivables percentage over one year past due italy spain portugal greece with the exception of greece  abbott historically has collected almost all of the outstanding receivables in these countries 
abbott continues to monitor the credit worthiness of customers located in these and other geographic areas and establishes an allowance against a trade receivable when it is probable that the balance will not be collected 
in addition to closely monitoring economic conditions and budgetary and other fiscal developments in these countries  abbott regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances  including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables 
abbott also monitors the potential for and periodically has utilized factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a material amount of total outstanding receivables

contingent obligations abbott has periodically entered into agreements in the ordinary course of business  such as assignment of product rights  with other companies which has resulted in abbott becoming secondarily liable for obligations that abbott was previously primarily liable 
since abbott no longer maintains a business relationship with the other parties  abbott is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments  if any  under these obligations 
based upon past experience  the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote 
in addition  abbott periodically acquires a business or product rights in which abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments and risk management market price sensitive investments abbott holds available for sale equity securities from strategic technology acquisitions 
the market value of these investments was approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
abbott monitors these investments for other than temporary declines in market value  and charges impairment losses to income when an other than temporary decline in value occurs

at december   abbott had billion of domestic commercial paper outstanding with an average annual interest rate of with an average remaining life of days 
the fair value of long term debt at december  and amounted to billion and billion  respectively average interest rates of with maturities through at december  and  the fair value of current and long term investment securities amounted to approximately billion and billion  respectively 
a hypothetical basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows  income or market values 
a basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible near term change in rates 
foreign currency sensitive financial instruments certain abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the us dollar 
these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are marked to market with the resulting gains or losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
gains or losses will be included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold  generally within the next twelve months
