critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these items are regularly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
these estimates include  among others  our revenue recognition policies related to the proportional performance and percentage of completion methodologies of revenue recognition of contracts and assessing our goodwill for impairment annually 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results will differ and may differ materially from the estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
our significant accounting policies are presented within note to our consolidated financial statements and the following summaries should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this report 
while all accounting policies impact the financial statements  certain policies may be viewed as critical 
critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most subjective or complex judgments and estimates 
our management believes the policies that fall within this category are the policies on revenue recognition  accounting for stock based compensation  goodwill  and income taxes 
revenue recognition the majority of the revenue recognized for the years ended march  and was derived from the company s subsidiaries  when all of the following criteria have been satisfied 
table of contents revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
in government contracting  the company recognizes revenue when a government consultant verifies and certifies an invoice for payment 
revenue from sale of goods is recognized when substantial risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the buyer under the terms of the contract 
for the sale of goods  the timing of the transfer of substantial risks and rewards of ownership is based on the contract terms negotiated with the buyer  eg  fob or cif 
igc considers the guidance provided under staff accounting bulletin sab in determining revenue from sales of goods 
considerations have been given to all four conditions for revenue recognition under that guidance 
the four conditions are contract persuasive evidence of our arrangement with the customers  delivery based on the terms of the contracts  the company assesses whether the underlying goods have been delivered and therefore the risks and rewards of ownership are completely transferred  fixed or determinable price the company enters into contracts where the price for the goods being sold is fixed and not contingent upon other factors 
collection is deemed probable at the time of recognition of revenue  the company makes an assessment of its ability to collect the receivable arising on the sale of the goods and determines that collection is probable 
revenue for any sale is recognized only if all of the four conditions set forth above are met 
the company assesses these criteria at the time of each sale 
in the absence of meeting any of the criteria set out above  the company defers revenue recognition until all of the four conditions are met 
revenue from construction project related activity and contracts for supply commissioning of complex plant and equipment is recognized as follows a cost plus contracts contract revenue is determined by adding the aggregate cost plus proportionate margin as agreed with the customer and expected to be realized 
b fixed price contracts contract revenue is recognized using the percentage completion method and the percentage of completion is determined as a proportion of cost incurred to date to the total estimated contract cost 
changes in estimates for revenues  costs to complete  and profit margins are recognized in the period in which they are reasonably determinable 
in many of the fixed price contracts entered into by the company  significant expenses are incurred in the mobilization stage in the early stages of the contract 
the expenses include those that are incurred in the transportation of machinery  erection of heavy machinery  clearing of the campsite  workshop ground cost  overheads  etc 
all such costs are booked to deferred expenses and written off over the period in proportion to revenues earned 
where the modifications of the original contract are such that they effectively add to the existing scope of the contract  the same are treated as a change orders 
on the other hand  where the modifications are such that they change or add an altogether new scope  these are accounted for as a separate new contract 
the company adjusts contract revenue and costs in connection with change orders only when both  the customer and the company with respect to both the scope and invoicing and payment terms  approve them 
in the event of claims in our percentage of completion contracts  the additional contract revenue relating to claims is only accounted after the proper award of the claim by the competent authority 
the contract claims are considered in the percentage of completion only after the proper award of the claim by the competent authority 
full provision is made for any loss in the period in which it is foreseen 
revenue from service related activities and miscellaneous other contracts are recognized when the service is rendered using the proportionate completion method or completed service contract method 

table of contents income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method  in accordance with asc  income taxes  which requires an entity to recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequence attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is established and recorded when management determines that some or all of the deferred tax assets are not likely to be realized and therefore  it is necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
in evaluating a tax position for recognition  management evaluates whether it is more likely than not that a position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  based on technical merits of the position 
if the tax position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold  the tax position is measured and recognized in the company s financial statements as the largest amount of tax benefit that  in management s judgment  is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
as of march  and  there was no significant liability for income tax associated with unrecognized tax benefits 
the issuance by igc of its common stock to hk ironman stockholders in exchange for hk ironman stock  as contemplated by the stock purchase agreement stock purchase agreement between the company  hk ironman  prc ironman and their stockholders  generally will not be a taxable transaction to us holders for us federal income tax purposes 
it is expected that igc and its stockholders will not recognize any gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes 
inventories we provide for inventory obsolescence  excess inventory and inventories with carrying values in excess of market values based on our assessment of the future demands  market conditions and our specific inventory management procedures 
if market conditions and actual demands are less favorable than our estimates  additional inventory write downs may be required 
in all cases inventory is carried at the lower of historical cost or market value 
accounts receivable we make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable by analyzing historical payment patterns  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  and current economic trends 
if the financial condition of a customer deteriorates  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess cost of an acquisition over the fair value of our share of net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition 
goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is disclosed separately 
goodwill is stated at cost less impairment losses incurred  if any 
the company adopted the provisions of accounting standards codification asc  intangibles goodwill and others previously referred to as sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which sets forth the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
asc requires that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets be allocated to the reporting unit level  which the company defines as each subsidiary 
asc also prohibits the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets upon adoption  but requires that they be tested for impairment at least annually  or more frequently as warranted  at the reporting unit level 
as per asc through  the impairment testing of goodwill is a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test shall be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
after a goodwill impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill shall be its new accounting basis 
subsequent reversal of a previously recognized goodwill impairment loss is prohibited once the measurement of that loss is completed 

table of contents in asc  a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below the operating segment 
a component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
the company has determined that igc operates in a single operating segment 
while the ceo reviews the consolidated financial information for the purposes of decisions relating to resource allocation  the cfo  on a need basis  looks at the financial statements of the individual legal entities in india for the limited purpose of consolidation 
given the existence of discrete financial statements at an individual entity level in india  the company believes that each of these entities constitute a separate reporting unit under a single operating segment 
therefore  the first step in the impairment testing for goodwill is the identification of reporting units and the allocation of goodwill to these reporting units 
accordingly  tbl  which is one of the legal entities  is also considered a separate reporting unit and therefore the company believes that the assessment of goodwill impairment at the subsidiary level  which is also a reporting unit  is appropriate 
the analysis of fair value is based on the estimate of the recoverable value of the underlying assets 
for long lived assets such as land  the company obtains appraisals from independent professional appraisers to determine the recoverable value 
for other assets such as receivables  the recoverable value is determined based on an assessment of the collectability and any potential losses due to default by the counter parties 
unlike goodwill  long lived assets are assessed for impairment only where there are any specific indicators for impairment 
impairment of investment the impairment analysis test is done based on a similar recoverable approach as used in the impairment test for goodwill described above 
the fair value of land is determined based on an independent appraisal of the land held by sricon 
the estimated amount of liability is based on the information available with us with respect of bank debt and other borrowings 
impairment of long lived assets the company reviews its long lived assets  with finite lives  for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be fully recoverable 
such circumstances include  though are not limited to  significant or sustained declines in revenues or earnings  future anticipated cash flows  business plans and material adverse changes in the economic climate  such as changes in operating environment  competitive information  impact of change in government policies  etc 
for assets that the company intends to hold for use  if the total of the expected future undiscounted cash flows produced by the assets or subsidiary company is less than the carrying amount of the assets  a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the assets 
for assets the company intends to dispose of by sale  a loss is recognized for the amount by which the estimated fair value less cost to sell is less than the carrying value of the assets 
fair value is determined based on quoted market prices  if available  or other valuation techniques including discounted future net cash flows 
recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements changes to us gaap are established by the financial accounting standards board fasb in the form of accounting standards updates asus to the fasb accounting standards codification 
the company considers the applicability and impact of all asus 
newly issued asus not listed below are expected to have no impact on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations  because either the asu is not applicable or the impact is expected to be immaterial 
effective january   company adopted amendments from the fasb to fair value accounting 
the amendments clarify the application of the highest and best use  and valuation premise concepts  preclude the application of blockage factors in the valuation of all financial instruments and include criteria for applying the fair value measurement principles to portfolios of financial instruments 
the amendments also prescribe additional disclosures for level fair value measurements and financial instruments not carried at fair value 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on company consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued new accounting disclosure requirements about the nature and exposure of offsetting arrangements related to financial and derivative instruments 
the requirements are effective for fiscal years beginning after january   which for us is the fiscal ending march the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on company consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued an accounting standards update that permits companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired before performing the two step goodwill impairment test required under current accounting standards 
the guidance is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of this standard will not impact our financial results 

table of contents in june  the fasb issued asu  which is now part of asc presentation of comprehensive income 
the new guidance will require companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements 
it eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the standard does not change the items  which must be reported in other comprehensive income 
these provisions are to be applied retrospectively and will be effective for us as of january  because this guidance impacts presentation only  it has no effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurement amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs 
this update defines fair value  clarifies a framework to measure fair value and requires specific disclosures of fair value measurements 
the guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after january  and is required to be applied retrospectively 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in april  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued new accounting guidance that addresses effective control in repurchase agreements and eliminated the requirement for entities to consider whether the transferor seller has the ability to repurchase the financial assets in a repurchase agreement 
this new accounting guidance was effective  on a prospective basis  for new transactions or modifications to existing transactions  on january  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on company consolidated financial position or results of operations 
results of operations fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march the following table presents an overview of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended march  and year ended march  change percent change revenues cost of revenues selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation impairment loss goodwill impairment loss investment operating income loss interest and other financial expenses interest income other income income before income taxes and minority interest attributable to non controlling interest tax benefit expense income loss after income taxes revenue total revenue was million for the year ended march   as compared to million for the year ended march   an increase of 
the revenue reported for and is from trading of ore in india and china 
the government of india has indicated that it will reopen the mines in fiscal our plants in china were intermittently open in fiscal we opened them on a test basis  while we await permission from the government to reopen them under the new ownership of igc and a new mining license 
we expect the government to allow us to reopen the mines on a continuous basis as soon as practical 
further  once shipping hub at the border of mongolia and china becomes operational and or the mines in india open  we will be in a position to export low grade ore from mongolia and or india to china for further beneficiation at our plants in inner mongolia 
cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of purchasing iron ore  transportation  local fees  handling and other logistics costs 
cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue decreased in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses these consist primarily of employee related expenses  professional fees  other corporate expenses  allocated overhead and provisions and write offs relating to doubtful and bad debts and advances 
the major portion of sg a is the overhead related to public company expenses and overheads in the us selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended march  compared million for the year ended march  the sg a for fye included about million of non cash employee related expenses from the award of stock and stock options 
the sg a expenses decreased by year over year 
overall in fiscal  the company took substantial steps to reduce and realign its overheads in india  china and the us 
table of contents depreciation the depreciation expense was million in as compared to million in the majority of the depreciation in fye was from the equipment related to mining 
impairment loss goodwill in fye the company impaired the goodwill related to the original purchase of tbl for million 
impairment loss investment for the year ended march   the company did not impair its investments operating income loss loss from operations reduced from million for the year ended march  to a loss of million for the year ended march   which is a decrease of million in losses 
the decrease in losses is mainly from the substantial decrease in g a and a decrease in cost of sales 
interest and other financial expense the interest expense for the year ended march  was million as compared to million for the year ended march  the decrease in interest expense is primarily due to repayment of high interest notes 
while the company has made significant progress in lowering its cost of capital  its cost of capital continues to be very expensive 
in fiscal  we focused on reducing the cost of capital by eliminating loans that carry very high interest rates and introducing ones that carry significantly lower interest rates 
we continue to have one loan at a very high interest rate that we are negotiating to either convert to equity  repay or refinance 
interest income the interest income for the year ended march  was million as compared to million for the year ended march  the income was derived mostly from cash that is held as deposits 
other income other income predominantly consists of foreign exchange gain loss arising from the restatement of the inter company receivables  denominated in indian rupees  and or renminbi to us dollars 
income tax expense we had an income tax credit of million for the year ended march  as compared to an expense of million for the year ended march  the tax credit is from our subsidiary in china and will be used in china and not in the us net loss the company had a loss of about million for the year ended march  as compared to a loss of about million for the year ended march  we have worked very hard in fiscal to a reduce overheads and overall sg a  b reduce our cost of capital by eliminating high interest loans  and c realigning the business to focus on the iron ore business 
we believe that our overall cash expenses related to overheads and interest have been reduced dramatically in preparation for the opening of mines in india and restarting the mines in china and future profitability 
balance sheet explanations intangible assets and goodwill the decrease in goodwill between fiscal and is attributed to the impairment of goodwill related to tbl and an adjustment of intangible assets and goodwill from the ironman acquisition 
liabilities in fiscal the company eliminated a substantial portion of its current and non current liability 
current liability was about million in fye and about in million in fye the reduction comes from reclassification of million of notes payable from current to non current  the elimination of dues to related parties and the elimination of deferred taxes 
the total liability was in fye as compared to million in fye a decrease of million 
the company eliminated million in liability to the shareholders of ironman and about in deferred tax liability associated with the acquisition of ironman 
non controlling interest the non controlling interest is attributed to our of ironman and represents 
in fiscal we eliminated the non controlling interest in tbl by purchasing of tbl 
liquidity and capital resources this liquidity and capital resources discussion compares the consolidated company results for the years ended march  and our future liquidity needs will depend on  among other factors  stability of iron ore prices  demand for iron ore  construction costs  interest rates  and a continued increase in infrastructure in india and china 
we believe that our current cash balances  anticipated operating cash flow in fiscal  and cash from claims are adequate to sustain the company  but not to fuel growth or future acquisitions 

table of contents on our balance sheet  in addition to the existing cash balances  we have about million in receivables and claims 
we have and continue to take measures to contain costs until we have visibility into increased liquidity and the opening of the mines in india and increased cash flow from our chinese operations 
we continue to explore other funding sources including negotiated settlement of accounts receivable  settlement of claims  bank lines  equity  convertible debentures and debt 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to access additional credit facilities 
our strategy is to develop businesses that have a very short receivable cycle like the export of ore to china and to aggressively collect our outstanding receivables and claims 
repatriation of funds from india requires obtaining clearances from the reserve bank of india rbi 
this process can take several months to complete 
we have compiled all the necessary information for the application  including obtaining the foreign inward remittance certificates firc from all our banks  for all our indian subsidiaries  and initiated the process of applying to the rbi for permission 
we have retained an indian foreign exchange expert to help with the process 
once we obtain the clearances from the rbi  repatriating funds from india will become significantly easier 
the company currently has a notes payable of million 
there is no cash interest payable on the loan 
the loan is due on july  off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
market risk is the sensitivity of income to changes in interest rates  foreign exchanges  commodity prices  equity prices  and other market driven rates or prices 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather  indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
customer risk the company s customers are the steel mills and iron ore traders 
the loss of a significant client may have a short term adverse effect on the company 
commodity prices and vendor risk the company is affected by the availability  cost and quality of raw materials iron ore and fuel 
the prices and supply of raw materials and fuel depend on factors beyond the control of the company  including general economic conditions  competition  production levels  transportation costs and import duties 
the company typically builds contingencies into the contracts  including indexing key commodity prices into escalation clauses 
however  drastic changes in the global markets for raw materials and fuels could affect our vendors  which may create disruptions in delivery schedules that could affect our ability to execute contracts in a timely manner 
we are taking steps to mitigate some of this risk by attempting to control the supply and quality of raw materials by tying up supply from mongolia and eventually india when the mines are reopened 
we do not currently hedge commodity prices on capital markets  which may expose the company to risks related to high prices 
labor risk we see limited labor risk in india or in china 
compliance  legal and operational risks we operate under regulatory and legal obligations imposed by the indian and chinese governments and us securities regulators 
those obligations relate  among other things  to the company s financial reporting  trading activities  capital requirements and the supervision of its employees 
failure to fulfill legal or regulatory obligations can lead to fines  censure or disqualification of management and or staff and other measures that could have negative consequences for our activities and financial performance 
we are mitigating this risk by hiring local consultants and staff who can manage the compliance in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
however  the cost of compliance in various jurisdictions could have a negative impact on our future earnings 
interest rate risk the mining industry is one in which leverage plays a large role 
a typical contract requires that we furnish an earnest money deposit  a performance guaranty and the ability to discount letters of credit 
finally  as interest rates rise  our cost of capital increases thus impacting our margins 

table of contents exchange rate sensitivity our indian subsidiaries conduct all business in indian rupees inr with the exception of foreign equipment that is purchased from the us or europe 
our chinese subsidiary  prc ironman  conducts all business in renminbi rmb 
prices for ore are set in usd and then converted to rmb 
prc ironman has no currency risk 
however  prc ironman is subject to price volatility 
exchange rates have an insignificant impact on our financial results 
however  as we convert from indian rupees and renminbi to us dollars and subsequently report in us dollars  we may see an impact on translated revenue and earnings 
essentially  a stronger us dollars decreases our reported earnings and a weakening us dollars increases our reported earnings 
we do not have loans in foreign currencies 
in the analysis below  we compared the reported revenue and expense for fiscal based on the average exchange rate used for fiscal to highlight the impact of exchange rate changes on igc s revenue and expenses 
year ended march  current exchange rate previous year exchange rate change percentage revenues total expenses before taxes foreign currency translation igc mainly operates in india and china and a substantial portion of the company s sales are denominated in inr and rmb 
as a result  changes in the relative values of the us dollar and inr or the rmb affect revenues and profits as the results are translated into us dollars in the consolidated and pro forma financial statements 
the accompanying financial statements are reported in us dollars 
the inr and the rmb are the functional currencies for the company 
the translation of the functional currencies into us dollars is performed for assets and liabilities using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenues  costs and expenses using average exchange rates prevailing during the reporting periods 
adjustments resulting from the translation of functional currency financial statements to reporting currency are accumulated and reported as other comprehensive income loss  a separate component of shareholders equity 
the exchange rates used for translation purposes are as under year month end average rate p l rate year end rate balance sheet rate inr per usd inr per usd inr per usd inr per usd inr per usd inr per usd inr per usd inr per usd inr per usd inr per usd inr rmb per usd inr rmb per usd inr rmb hkd per usd inr rmb hkd per usd
