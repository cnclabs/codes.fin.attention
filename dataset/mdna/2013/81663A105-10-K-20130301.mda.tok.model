such changes include  but are not limited to the deconsolidation in july  and the reconsolidation in november  of semcams and semcanada crude  the deconsolidation in july of semcanada energy and blueknight energy partners  lp  our predecessor bankruptcy  which resulted in significant professional fee expenses and losses on the disposal or impairment of long lived assets

we have responded to this demand with additional storage tanks and gas processing facilities and we are building new crude oil gathering and transportation pipelines 
we  and our significant equity method investees  own gathering systems  transportation pipelines  processing plants  storage facilities and terminals in the midwest and rocky mountain regions of the us and in alberta  canada 
we maintain and operate storage  terminal and marine facilities at milford haven in the uk that enable customers to supply products to markets in the atlantic basin 
we also operate a network of liquid asphalt cement terminals throughout mexico 
how we evaluate our operations our management uses a variety of financial and operational metrics to analyze our performance 
we view these metrics as important factors in evaluating our profitability and review these measurements on at least a monthly basis for consistency and trend analysis 
these metrics include financial measures such as adjusted gross margin  operating expenses and adjusted ebitda 
adjusted gross margin we view adjusted gross margin as an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations  as well as our operating performance as compared to that of other companies in our industry  without regard to financing methods  historical cost basis  capital structure or the impact of fluctuating commodity prices 
we define adjusted gross margin as total revenues minus cost of products sold and unrealized gain loss on derivatives 
adjusted gross margin allows us to make a meaningful comparison of the operating results between our fee based activities  which do not involve the purchase or sale of petroleum products  and our fixed margin and marketing operations  which do 
in addition  adjusted gross margin allows us to make a meaningful comparison of the results of our fixed margin and marketing operations across different commodity price environments because it measures the spread between the product sales price and costs of products sold 
operating expenses our management seeks to maximize the profitability of our operations  in part  by minimizing operating expenses 
these expenses are comprised of salary and wage expense  utility costs  insurance premiums  taxes and other operating costs  some of which are independent of the volumes we handle 
the current high levels of crude oil exploration  development and production activities are increasing competition for personnel and equipment 
this increased competition is placing upward pressure on the prices we pay for labor  supplies and miscellaneous equipment 
to the extent we are unable to procure necessary services or offset higher costs  our operating results will be negatively impacted 
adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss before interest expense  income tax expense benefit  depreciation and amortization and adjusted for selected items that semgroup believes impact the comparability of financial results between reporting periods 
we use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental performance measure to assess our operating performance as compared to that of other companies in our industry  without regard to financing methods  historical cost basis  capital structure or the impact of fluctuating commodity prices  and 
table of contents the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities 
note about non gaap financial measures adjusted gross margin and adjusted ebitda are not financial measures presented in accordance with gaap 
we believe that the presentation of these non gaap financial measures will provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations 
operating income loss is the gaap measure most directly comparable to adjusted gross margin  and net income loss is the gaap measure most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda 
our non gaap financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures 
each of these non gaap financial measures has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some  but not all  items that affect the most directly comparable gaap financial measure 
you should not consider adjusted gross margin or adjusted ebitda in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
because adjusted gross margin and adjusted ebitda may be defined differently by other companies in our industry  our definitions of these non gaap financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies  thereby diminishing their utility 
management compensates for the limitations of adjusted gross margin and adjusted ebitda as an analytical tool by reviewing the comparable gaap measures  understanding the difference between adjusted gross margin and adjusted ebitda  on the one hand  and operating income loss and net income loss  on the other hand  and incorporating this knowledge into its decision making processes 
we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating our operating results 
the following table presents a reconciliation of operating income loss to adjusted gross margin and net income loss to adjusted ebitda  the most directly comparable gaap financial measures  on a historical basis for each of the periods indicated

table of contents non cash equity compensation adjusted ebitda business and performance drivers we operate our business through six primary business segments crude  semstream  semlogistics  semcams  semmexico and semgas 
we generate revenue in these segments by utilizing our assets to provide products and services to third parties and by selectively using our assets to support our marketing activities 
we believe that the variety of our petroleum product assets creates opportunities for us and our customers that avoid seasonal fluctuations of less diverse businesses 
certain factors are key to our operations 
these include the safe  reliable and efficient operation of the pipelines and facilities that we own and operate  while meeting the regulations that govern the operation of our assets and the costs associated with such regulations 
our revenue is impacted by several factors  including throughput and processing fees throughput and processing fees are fees charged to third parties based on volumes of product run through our processing facilities or pipeline gathering systems 
service  storage and terminalling fees storage and terminalling fees are fees charged to third parties for petroleum product storage or terminalling services provided by us and are based on leased shell capacity and or volumes moved through our terminal facilities 
petroleum product marketing we intend to capture the normalized gross margin associated with the purchase and sale of petroleum products 
purchases  sales and derivative transactions related to this activity are tracked in our systems to the ultimate realization of profit 
we seek to maintain limited net open positions to manage our exposure to commodity prices 
marketing transactions may only be entered into by persons delegated such authority by senior management  as provided in our comprehensive risk management policy 
each person authorized to make transactions is subject to internal volume and dollar limits  portfolios are subject to net open position and stop loss limits  and counterparties are subject to credit limits and provisions as approved by our credit department 
see business risk governance and comprehensive risk management policy for more information on our comprehensive risk management policy 
revenue our revenue is generated from third party fees earned through the gathering  pipeline transporting and storing of petroleum products principally in the midwest region 
our customers pay us fees based on volumes gathered  transported and stored  through the sale of petroleum products based upon contract or index rates per barrel  million btu or gallon 
we generate additional revenue through selected marketing of petroleum products 
marketing operations consist primarily of aggregating petroleum products purchased at the lease along pipeline systems or trucked  and arranging the necessary transportation logistics for the ultimate sale or delivery of the petroleum products to customers or other end users 
gathering and transportation revenue is recognized as petroleum products are delivered to customers 
storage revenue is recognized upon leasing of shell capacity on a take or pay basis 
marketing revenue is accrued at the time title to the petroleum product sold transfers to the purchaser  which typically occurs upon receipt of the petroleum product by the purchaser 
we utilize futures  swaps and options contracts to manage our exposure to market changes in commodity prices  to protect our gross margins on our purchased petroleum products and to manage our liquidity risk associated with margin deposit requirements on our overall derivative positions 
when purchasing petroleum products  we seek to manage our exposure to commodity price risk 
as we purchase inventory from suppliers  we may establish a fixed or variable margin with future sales utilizing one of the following methods we have already sold that product for physical delivery pursuant to sales contracts at a market index price  we sell the product for future physical delivery pursuant to effectively back to back sales contracts  or we enter into futures and swaps contracts on the nymex or over the counter otc markets 
in addition  we may purchase put options or derivatives other than futures or swaps to hedge our inventory of petroleum products prior to our sale of such inventory 

table of contents asc  nonmonetary transactions  requires certain transactions those where inventory is purchased from a customer then resold to the same customer to be presented in the income statement on a net basis  resulting in a reduction of revenue and costs of products sold by the same amount  but has no effect on operating income loss 
however  changes in the level of such purchase and sale activity between periods can have an effect on the comparison between those periods 
volumes generally  we expect revenue to increase or decrease in conjunction with increases or decreases in total volumes 
our total volumes are affected by different factors  including our physical storage or transportation capacity  our working capital and credit availability under our credit facilities to support petroleum product purchases and the availability of the supply of petroleum product available for purchase  which is determined based primarily upon producer activity in market areas contiguous with our asset base 
commodity prices our business is primarily fee based 
as a result  our financial results are typically not correlated with increases and decreases in commodity prices 
our financial results  however  are positively correlated with the absolute difference between current prompt and future month petroleum product prices 
that is  wide contango when the prices for future deliveries are higher than current prices spreads generally have a favorable impact on our results relative to a slightly contango  flat or backwardated when the prices for future deliveries are lower than current prices market 
timing of purchase and sales our financial results are affected by the timing of the purchase and sale of petroleum products  such that financial results may not be comparable between periods 
when we enter into an arrangement to purchase product  place the product in storage and resell the product in the future  our financial results do not reflect any related margin until the settlement of the product sale 
prior to the settlement of the product sale  our results reflect the cost of the product in our inventory 
differences in the timing of our product purchases and sales  especially if they extend over fiscal years or quarters  may result in sizable differences between our results over the comparable period 
analysis of business segments the following provides an overview of the makeup of revenue at each of our respective business segments 
crude rose rock was formed in august in november  semgroup contributed semcrude  lp to rose rock in exchange for limited partner interests  general partner interests and certain incentive distribution rights 
in december  rose rock completed an initial public offering in which it sold  common units representing limited partner interests 
semgroup consolidates the accounts of rose rock as a result of the level of its ownership interests and control over the entity 
crude conducts business through its direct and indirect via rose rock ownership interest in white cliffs and the general partner interest and of the limited partner interest in rose rock 
these operations include crude oil transportation  storage  terminalling  gathering and marketing in colorado  kansas  montana  north dakota  oklahoma and texas  for third party customers as well as for itself 
the crude business unit consists of four primary operations i cushing storage  ii kansas and oklahoma pipeline system  iii bakken shale operations  and iv platteville facility 
a majority of crude s revenue is generated from fee based contractual arrangements that  in some instances  are fixed and not dependent on usage 
fee based services crude charges a capacity or volume based fee for the unloading  transportation and storage of crude oil and related ancillary services 
crude s fee based services include substantially all of its operations in cushing  oklahoma and platteville  colorado and a portion of the transportation services it provides on its kansas and oklahoma pipeline system 
some of crude s fee based contracts are take or pay contracts  whereby the customer is required to pay crude a fixed minimum monthly fee regardless of usage 
for the years ended december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of crude s adjusted gross margin was generated by providing fee based services to customers 
fixed margin transactions crude purchases crude oil from a producer or supplier at a designated receipt point at an index price  less a transportation fee  and simultaneously sells an identical volume of crude oil at a designated delivery point to the same party at 
table of contents the same index price  thereby locking in a fixed margin that is  in effect  economically equivalent to a transportation fee 
we refer to these arrangements as fixed margin or buy sell transactions 
these fixed margin transactions account for a portion of the adjusted gross margin crude generates on its kansas and oklahoma pipeline system and through its bakken shale operations 
for the years ended december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of its adjusted gross margin was generated through fixed margin transactions 
marketing activities crude conducts marketing activities by purchasing crude oil for its own account from producers  aggregators and traders and selling crude oil to traders and refiners 
crude s marketing activities account for a portion of the adjusted gross margin it generates on its kansas and oklahoma pipeline system and through its bakken shale operations 
for the years ended december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of its adjusted gross margin was generated through marketing activities 
we mitigate the commodity price exposure of our crude oil marketing operations by limiting our net open positions through i the concurrent purchase and sale of like quantities of crude oil to create back to back transactions intended to lock in positive margins based on the timing  location or quality of the crude oil purchased and delivered or ii derivative contracts 
all of our marketing activities are subject to our comprehensive risk management policy  which establishes limits to manage risk and mitigate financial exposure 
more specifically  we utilize futures and swap contracts to manage our exposure to market changes in commodity prices  to protect our adjusted gross margin on our purchased crude oil and to manage our liquidity risk associated with margin deposit requirements on our overall derivative positions 
as we purchase inventory from suppliers  we may establish a fixed or variable margin with future sales by selling a like quantity of crude oil for future physical delivery to create an effective back to back transaction  or entering into futures and swaps contracts on the nymex or otc markets 
semstream until december   semstream was engaged in the residential propane supply business through its wholly owned subsidiary  semstream arizona  with operations in page and payson  arizona 
in september  we entered into a definitive agreement to sell those assets 
the sale was finalized on december   after receiving the required approval by the arizona corporation commission

semlogistics semlogistics owns the largest independent petroleum products storage facility in the uk the facility is located on the north bank of the milford haven waterway on the west coast of wales 
the main activities of semlogistics are the receipt  storage and redelivery of clean petroleum and crude oil products via sea going vessels at the milford haven site 
semlogistic s revenue is based on fixed fee storage tank leases and related services 
semcams semcams operates majority owned gathering assets and natural gas processing plants 
all of semcams assets are located in west central alberta  in the heart of the western canadian sedimentary basin 
semcams revenue is based on fee based throughput arrangements  which represent  in part  operating cost recovery from working interest owners in certain processing plants and is recorded when earned in accordance with the terms of the related agreement 
semmexico semmexico operates a network of liquid asphalt terminals in mexico 
operations include purchasing  producing  storing and distributing liquid asphalt cement products 
semmexico purchases asphalt from refineries in mexico 
semmexico s revenue is based on contractual arrangements with customers for liquid asphalt cement 
semgas semgas provides gathering  processing and storage services to the natural gas markets in the us semgas owns and operates gathering systems and processing plants in kansas  oklahoma and texas 
semgas aggregates gas supplies from the wellhead and provides various services to producers that condition the wellhead gas production for downstream markets 

table of contents semgas performance is largely based on percent of proceeds and percent of index contractual arrangements where semgas receives a portion of product sales as well as fee based gathering service payments 
recent developments on january   we contributed a one third interest in semcrude pipeline  llc scpl to rose rock in exchange for i cash of approximately million  ii the issuance of million common units  iii the issuance of million class a units and iv an increase of the capital account of the general partner of rose rock and a related issuance of general partner interest  to allow the general partner of rose rock to maintain its two percent general partner interest 
the class a units are not entitled to receive any distributions of available cash other than upon liquidation prior to the first day of the month immediately following the first month for which the average daily throughput volumes on the white cliffs pipeline for such month are  barrels per day or greater 
upon such date  the class a units will automatically convert into common units 
scpl owns a percent membership interest in white cliffs  giving rose rock an indirect percent interest in white cliffs 
in connection with this transaction  rose rock issued and sold million common units to third party purchasers in a private placement 
in addition  rose rock exercised the accordion feature of its revolving credit facility and increased the total borrowing capacity under the credit facility from million to million and made a borrowing of approximately million under the credit facility 
the proceeds from the private placement and the borrowing were used by rose rock to fund the cash consideration in the transaction with us and to pay certain related transaction costs and expenses 
in january  we announced our intention to pay a quarterly cash dividend to common stockholders beginning in the second quarter of this dividend is planned to be a pass through of the majority of the cash distributions we receive from our interests in rose rock and ngl energy 
the dividend is expected to be based on the previous quarter distributions received 
white cliffs has received sufficient binding shipper commitments during its recent open season to move forward with an expansion project which will increase the pipeline capacity from approximately  barrels per day to about  barrels per day 
subject to ferc and other regulatory approvals  the expansion is anticipated to be in service in the first half of rose rock will operate the expanded pipeline

semlogistics year ended december  in thousands revenues expenses costs of products sold operating general and administrative depreciation and amortization loss on disposal or impairment of long lived assets  net total expenses operating income loss versus revenue revenue decreased in to million from million in the decline in revenue is a result of a decline in the volume of storage leased and a drop in storage rates 
high crude oil prices and backwardated market conditions ie  prices for future deliveries are lower than current prices exist today and are forecast to continue into these factors have a negative effect on storage economics 
as a result  the demand for storage is depressed and we have experienced difficulty securing contract renewals and replacement of long term contracts 
we are uncertain when market conditions will improve 
however  we believe that geographical imbalances between the production and consumption of crude oil and related refined products will require physical transportation and  as a result  bulk liquid storage must play a key role in the supply chain 
this creates a demand for storage which is independent of current crude oil prices  forward price curves and the entire speculative trading environment 
storage economics have been unfavorable for some time 
as a result  during the third quarter  we conducted a test for recoverability in accordance with the guidance provided in asc  impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
the estimated undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying amount of the assets  therefore  the carrying amount of the long lived assets are considered recoverable and an impairment was not recorded 
we reviewed this analysis in the fourth quarter of and again concluded that impairment was not warranted 
we are aware that it is necessary to continue to monitor this situation and recognize the possibility that an impairment of the long lived assets may be required in the near future 

table of contents general and administrative expense general and administrative expense decreased in to million from million in this decrease is primarily the result of giving effect to a transfer pricing study which decreased the allocation of corporate costs by approximately million 
loss on disposal or impairment during the fourth quarter of each year  we perform a goodwill impairment test for each of our segments that has goodwill 
semlogistics passed the test initially  however  a review of the sensitivity of the test results indicated that a ten percent reduction in the estimated revenue in and would result in a test failure 
the sensitivity of the test results to loss of revenue led us to conclude that impairment of the goodwill of semlogistics was required 
accordingly  we impaired the full amount of goodwill which was million on october  versus revenue revenue decreased in to million from million in the decline in revenue is a result of a decline in the volume of storage leased 
high crude oil prices and backwardated market conditions ie  prices for future deliveries are lower than current prices existed 
these factors had a negative effect on storage economics 
as a result  the demand for storage was depressed and we experienced difficulty securing contract renewals 
operating expense operating expense decreased in to million from million in this decline is due primarily to a reduction in employee related expenses such as the elimination of the short term incentive program 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased in to million from million in this increase is due to an increase in employee related expenses such as costs related to deferred capital projects and severance costs 
loss on disposal or impairment during the fourth quarter of each year  we perform a goodwill impairment test for each of our segments that has goodwill 
semlogistics passed the test initially  however  a review of the sensitivity of the test results indicated that a ten percent reduction in the estimated revenue in and would result in a test failure 
the sensitivity of the test results to loss of revenue led us to conclude that impairment of the goodwill of semlogistics was required

approximately million of such fees related to turnaround costs are included in revenue for the current year 
in addition  maintenance capital recovery fees of million and increased capital fees on take or pay contracts of million also contributed to the increase 
these increases were offset  in part  by estimated lost revenue due to wells that have been shut in by producers because of relatively low natural gas prices million and estimated lost revenue due to turnaround activity million

liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash our principal sources of short term liquidity are cash generated from our operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
the consolidated cash balance on december  including restricted cash was approximately million 
of this amount  approximately million was held in canada and may be subject to tax if transferred to the us  and approximately million is restricted cash primarily set aside for settlement of pre petition claims 
potential sources of long term liquidity include debt and equity securities 
our primary cash requirements currently are operating expenses  capital expenditures and quarterly distributions to unitholders of our subsidiary  rose rock 
in general  we expect to fund operating expenses  maintenance capital expenditures and cash distributions through existing cash and cash from operating activities  expansion capital expenditures and any working capital deficits through cash on hand and our revolving credit facilities  and 
table of contents debt principal payments through cash from operating activities and refinancings when the credit facilities become due 
our ability to meet our financing requirements and fund our planned capital expenditures will depend on our future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in our industry 
in addition  we are subject to conditions in the debt and equity markets for any issuances of debt securities and equity securities including limited partner units 
there can be no assurance we will be able or willing to access the public or private markets in the future 
if we would be unable or unwilling to access those markets  we could be required to restrict future expansion capital expenditures and potential future acquisitions 
we believe our cash from operations and our remaining borrowing capacity allow us to manage our day to day cash requirements  distribute the minimum quarterly distribution on rose rock outstanding common units and meet our capital expenditures commitments for the coming year

capital requirements the midstream energy business can be capital intensive  requiring significant investment for the maintenance of existing assets or acquisition or development of new systems and facilities 
we categorize our capital expenditures as either maintenance capital expenditures  which are cash expenditures including expenditures for the addition or improvement to  or the replacement of  our capital assets or for the acquisition of existing  or the construction or development of new  capital assets made to maintain our long term operating income or operating capacity  or expansion capital expenditures  which are cash expenditures incurred for acquisitions or capital improvements that we expect will increase our operating income or operating capacity over the long term

projected capital expenditures for are estimated at million in expansion projects  including capital contributions to affiliates to fund growth projects  and million in maintenance projects 
these estimates may change as future events unfold 
see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements 
we anticipate that we will continue to make significant expansion capital expenditures in the future 
consequently  our ability to develop and maintain sources of funds to meet our capital requirements is critical to our ability to meet our growth objectives 
we expect that our future expansion capital expenditures will be funded by cash from operations  borrowings under our credit facilities and the issuance of debt and equity securities

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance  as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the application of these policies involves judgments regarding future events  including the likelihood of success of particular projects and legal and regulatory challenges 
these judgments  in and of themselves  could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions  which may be appropriate to use 
in addition  the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect  not only on the operation of the business  but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures  even if the nature of the accounting policies have not changed 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates using historical experience  consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable 
actual results may differ substantially from our estimates 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 

table of contents our significant accounting policies are summarized in note of our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this form k 
we identify our critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations  and that require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
accounting policy judgment uncertainty affecting application derivative instruments instruments used in valuation techniques market maturity and economic conditions contract interpretation market conditions in the energy industry  especially the effects of price volatility on contractual commitments income taxes and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets ability to withstand legal challenges of tax authority decisions or appeals anticipated future decisions of tax authorities application of tax statutes and regulations to transactions ability to use tax benefits carry forwards to future periods impairment of long lived assets recoverability of investment through future operations regulatory and political environments and requirements estimated useful lives of assets environmental obligations and operational limitations estimates of future cash flows estimates of fair value judgment about triggering effects goodwill and other intangible assets estimated useful lives for finite lived intangible assets judgment about impairment triggering events identification of reporting units estimates of reporting unit fair value contingencies estimated financial impact of event judgment about the likelihood of event occurring regulatory and political environments and requirements derivative instruments we follow the guidance of asc  derivatives and hedging  to account for derivative instruments 
asc requires us to mark to market all derivative instruments on the balance sheet  and recognize changes in the fair value of non hedge derivative instruments immediately in earnings 
in certain cases  we may apply hedge accounting to our derivative instruments 
the criteria used to determine if hedge accounting treatment is appropriate are i the designation of the hedge to an underlying exposure  ii whether the overall risk is being reduced  and iii if there is a correlation between the fair value of the derivative instrument and the underlying hedged item 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments accounted for as hedges are either recognized in earnings as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the related hedged item  or deferred and recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur 
certain derivative instruments that meet the criteria for derivative accounting treatment also qualify for a scope exception to derivative accounting  as they are considered to be a normal purchase normal sale npns 
the availability of this exception is based on the assumption that the company has the ability  and it is probable  to deliver or take delivery of the underlying item 
these assumptions are based on internal forecasts of sales and historical physical delivery on contracts 
derivatives that are considered to be npns are exempt from derivative accounting treatment and are accounted for under 
table of contents accrual accounting 
if it is determined that a transaction designated as npns no longer meets the scope exception due to changes in estimates  the related contract would be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value combined with immediate recognition through earnings 
income taxes and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of december   we have a valuation allowance of million on our deferred tax assets 
foreign tax credits of million are the primary deferred tax asset 
as of december   we had a valuation allowance of million on our deferred tax assets 
foreign tax credits of million were the primary deferred tax asset 
in assessing the recognition of our deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character within the carryback and carryforward period available under the tax law 
sources of taxable income include future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  future earnings and available tax planning strategies 
considerable judgment is required to determine the tax treatment of a particular item that involves interpretations of complex tax laws 
we are subject to examination by taxing authorities for income tax returns filed in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions including canada  mexico and the united kingdom 
evaluation of assets for impairment for other than temporary decline in value in accordance with asc  property  plant and equipment  we evaluate property  plant and equipment and certain intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
examples of such indicators are significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset  significant adverse change in the manner an asset is used or its physical condition  adverse business climate  accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an asset  current period loss combined with a history of losses or the projection of future losses  and change in our intent about an asset from an intent to hold such asset through the end of its estimated useful life to a greater than fifty percent likelihood that such asset will be disposed of before then 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets 
generally  fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows 
however  actual future market prices and costs could vary from the assumptions used in our estimates and the impact of such variations could be material 
goodwill and other intangible assets we apply asc  business combinations  and asc  intangibles goodwill and other  to account for goodwill and intangible assets 
in accordance with these standards  we amortize all finite lived intangible assets over their respective estimated weighted average useful lives  while goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized 
however  goodwill and all intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment at least annually  or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we test for impairment at the reporting unit level using three valuation approaches first  the income approach which measures the value of an asset by the present value of its future economic benefit  second  the market approach which measures the value of an asset through the analysis of recent sales or offerings of comparable properties  and third  the cost approach which measures the value of an asset by the cost to reconstruct or replace it with another of like utility 
estimation of future economic benefit requires management to make assumptions about numerous variables including selling prices  costs  the level of activity and appropriate discount rates 
if it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount  our goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives will be impaired at that time 
contingencies we record a loss contingency when management determines that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
such determinations are subject to interpretations of current facts and 
table of contents circumstances  forecasts of future events and estimates of the financial impacts of such events 
gain contingencies are not recorded

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk this discussion on market risks represents an estimate of possible changes in future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in commodity prices  interest rates and currency exchange rates 
our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur  and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated based on actual fluctuations in commodity prices  interest rates  currency exchange rates and the timing of transactions 
we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in i petroleum prices  particularly natural gas liquids  crude oil and natural gas  ii interest rates  and iii currency exchange rates 
we may utilize from time to time various derivative instruments to manage such exposure 
our risk management policies and procedures are designed to monitor physical and financial commodity positions and the resulting outright commodity price risk as well as basis risk resulting from differences in commodity grades  purchase and sale locations and purchase and sale timing 
we have a risk management function that has responsibility and authority for our comprehensive risk management policy  which governs our enterprise wide risks  including the market risks discussed in this item 
subject to our comprehensive risk management policy  our finance and treasury function has responsibility and authority for managing exposure to interest rates and currency exchange rates 
to manage the risks discussed above  we engage in price risk management activities 
commodity price risk the table below outlines the range of nymex prompt month daily settle prices for crude oil and natural gas futures  and the range of daily propane spot prices provided by an independent  third party broker for the years ended december   december  and light sweet crude oil futures per barrel mont belvieu non ldh spot propane per gallon henry hub natural gas futures per mmbtu year ended december  high low high low differential year ended december  high low high low differential year ended december  high low high low differential revenue from our asset based activities is dependent on throughput volume  tariff rates  the level of fees generated from our pipeline systems  capacity leased to third parties  capacity that we use for our own operational or marketing activities and the level of other fees generated at our terminalling and storage facilities 
profit from our marketing activities is dependent on our ability to sell petroleum products at prices in excess of our aggregate cost 
margins may be affected during transitional periods between a backwardated market when the prices for future deliveries are lower than the current prices and a contango market when the prices for future deliveries are higher than the current prices 
our petroleum product marketing activities within each of our segments are generally not directly affected by the absolute level of petroleum product prices  but are affected by overall levels of supply and demand for petroleum products and relative fluctuations in marked related indices 

table of contents however  the semgas segment has exposure to commodity price risk because of the nature of certain contracts for which our fee is based on a percentage of proceeds or index related to the prices of natural gas  natural gas liquids and condensate 
given current volumes  liquid recoveries and contract terms  we estimate the following sensitivities a change in natural gas price results in approximately a thousand impact to adjusted gross margin 
a change in natural gas liquids prices conway and mont belvieu results in approximately a million impact to adjusted gross margin 
a change in condensate price results in approximately a million impact to adjusted gross margin 
the above sensitivities may be impacted by changes in contract mix  change in production or other factors which are outside of our control 
additionally  based on our open derivative contracts at december   an increase in the applicable market price or prices for each derivative contract would result in a decrease in our crude oil sales revenues 
likewise  a decrease in the applicable market price or prices for each derivative contract would result in an increase in our crude oil sales revenues 
however  the increases or decreases in crude oil sales revenues we recognize from our open derivative contracts are substantially offset by higher or lower crude oil sales revenues when the physical sale of the product occurs 
these contracts may be for the purchase or sale of crude oil or in markets different from the physical markets in which we are attempting to hedge our exposure  or may have timing differences relative to the physical markets 
as a result of these factors  our hedges may not eliminate all price risks 
the notional volumes and fair value of our commodity derivatives open positions  as well as the change in fair value that would be expected from a market price increase or decrease  is shown in the table below in thousands notional volume barrels fair value effect of price increase effect of price decrease settlement date crude oil futures contracts january february margin deposits or other credit support  including letters of credit  are generally required on derivative instruments utilized to manage our price exposure 
as commodity prices increase or decrease  the fair value of our derivative instruments changes  thereby increasing or decreasing our margin deposit or other credit support requirements 
although a component of our risk management strategy is intended to manage the margin and other credit support requirements on our derivative instruments  volatile spot and forward commodity prices  or an expectation of increased commodity price volatility  could increase the cash needed to manage our commodity price exposure and thereby increase our liquidity requirements 
this may limit amounts available to us through borrowing  decrease the volume of petroleum products we purchase and sell or limit our commodity price management activities 
interest rate risk we utilize both fixed and variable rate debt and are exposed to market risk due to the floating interest rates on our credit facilities 
therefore  from time to time we may utilize interest rate derivatives to manage interest obligations on specific debt issuances 
our variable rate debt bears interest at libor or prime  subject to certain floors  plus the applicable margin 
at december   an increase in these base rates of  above the base rate floors  would increase our interest expense by million per year 
the average interest rates presented below are based upon rates in effect at december  and december  the carrying value of the variable rate instruments in our credit facilities approximate fair value primarily because our rates fluctuate with prevailing market rates
