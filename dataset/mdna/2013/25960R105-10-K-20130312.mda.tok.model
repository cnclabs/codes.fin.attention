item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december   and should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report on form k  including information with respect to our plans and strategies for our business  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should review the risk factors section of this annual report on form k for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in  or implied by  the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k 
results of operations overview in assessing our results of operations in a given period  one of the primary factors we consider is the level of snowfall experienced within the prior snow season 
we typically compare the snowfall level in a given period both to the snowfall level in the prior season and to those snowfall levels we consider to be average 
references to average snowfall levels below refer to the aggregate average inches of snowfall recorded in cities in snow belt states in the united states during the annual snow season  from october through march  from to during this period  snowfall averaged  inches  with the low in such period being  inches and the high being  inches 
during the six month snow season ending march  snowfall was  inches which was lower than average as well as the lowest in the period from to meanwhile  during the six month snow seasons ending march  and  we experienced above average snowfall approximately and above average during the six months ending march  and snow seasons  respectively 
in addition to the historically low snowfall levels for the six month snow season ending march   we believe that other factors also negatively affected our business 
these additional factors included the timing  amount  and location of snowfall in the fourth quarter of  which had an adverse impact on our fourth quarter results  the record drought in the summer of and the continued macro economic uncertainty 
sales of parts and accessories for and were million and million  respectively  or approximately below and higher than average annual parts and accessories sales over the preceding ten years  respectively 
sales of equipment unit sales for and were million and million  respectively 
in  equipment unit sales decreased as we sold  equipment units in as compared to  equipment units in we believe that the decline of both parts and accessories sales and equipment unit sales in as compared to the prior calendar year is a direct result of the historically low snowfall and the lingering impact of economic uncertainty in the marketplace 
meanwhile  we believe that pent up demand due to deferred new equipment purchases still exists in the marketplace and could be released in or following a year of average or better snowfall that is accompanied by stronger macro economic conditions 
we believe this deferral of new equipment purchases could result in an elevated multi year replacement cycle as the economy recovers 
the following table shows our sales of snow and ice control equipment and related parts and accessories as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
during the years ended december  
table of contents  and  we sold   and  units of snow and ice control equipment  respectively 
year ended december  equipment parts and accessories the following table sets forth  for the periods presented  the consolidated statements of income of the company and its subsidiaries 
all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
in the table below and throughout this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  consolidated statements of income data for the years ended december   and have been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements

table of contents the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of certain items in our consolidated statement of income data  relative to net sales for the year ended december  in thousands net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative expense intangibles amortization management fees related party income from operations interest expense  net loss on extinguishment of debt other income expense  net income before taxes income tax expense net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales were million for the year ended december  compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
this decrease was driven by decreases of million in sales of snow and ice control equipment and million in parts and accessories sales 
the decrease in sales of snow and ice control equipment for the year ended december  was attributable to a decrease in sales volume of snow and ice control equipment of million  or  as compared to the prior year  slightly offset by price increases that we implemented in the fourth quarter of and that extended throughout the remainder of and and an additional price increase that was effective in the third and fourth quarters of the decrease in sales volume was largely a result of the below average snow season ending march  net sales of parts and accessories decreased in the year ended december  from the year ended december  by  from million to million 
net sales of parts and accessories remained comparatively low in  below the preceding ten year average by approximately 
as discussed above  the comparatively lower sales of parts and accessories was due in large part to below average snowfall resulting in decreased equipment usage 
additionally  equipment sales were lower below the immediately preceding ten year average  mainly attributable to lack of snowfall 
cost of sales 
cost of sales was million for the year ended december  compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
this decrease was driven primarily by decreased volume 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  as a result of lower volumes to absorb fixed spending 
in  inflationary commodity experience was cost neutral as compared to negative inflationary commodity experience throughout the favorability of inflation experienced in was more than offset by negative fixed cost absorption resulting from decreases in volume of equipment units and parts and accessories 
as a percentage of cost of sales  fixed and variable costs were approximately and  respectively  for the year ended december  versus approximately and  respectively for the year ended december  
table of contents gross profit 
gross profit was million for the year ended december  compared to million in  a decrease of million  or  due to the decrease in net sales volume described above under net sales and cost of sales 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased from for the year ended december  to for the corresponding period in  as a result of the factors discussed above under net sales and cost of sales 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses  including intangible asset amortization and management fees  were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  driven by lower incentive based compensation of million due to lower operating results 
we spent million in on offering costs to allow our former principal stockholders to dispose of their remaining holdings in our common stock while we did not incur any offering costs in the remaining decrease in is a result of management pulling back on discretionary spending in order to preserve profitability in a low sales volume year 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses  including intangibles amortization and management fees  increased from for the year ended december  to for the corresponding period in due to items discussed above 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million in the corresponding period in the decrease in interest expense for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year was due to a voluntary million payment made on the term loan in january loss on extinguishment of debt 
loss on extinguishment of debt was zero for the year ended december  compared to a total of million for the year ended december  the loss on extinguishment of debt in was entirely driven by our entry into a new term loan facility resulting in a significant modification of our debt which resulted in the write off of unamortized capitalized deferred financing costs of million and write off of unamortized debt discount of million 
income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
the largest item affecting deferred taxes is the difference between book and tax amortization of goodwill and other intangibles amortization 
our effective combined federal and state tax rate for was compared to for the effective tax rate for the year ended december  is higher than as we were in a taxable loss position in and thus unable to utilize the domestic production activities deduction while we were in a taxable income position in and able to utilize the domestic production activities deduction 
net income 
net income for the year ended december  was million compared to net income of million for the corresponding period in  a decrease of million 
this decrease was driven by the factors described above 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales were million for the year ended december  compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily driven by increases of million in sales of snow and ice control equipment and million in parts and accessories sales 
the increase in sales of snow and ice control equipment for the year ended december  was attributable to an increase in sales volume of snow and ice control equipment of million  or  as compared to the prior year and price increases that we implemented in the third quarter of and that extended throughout the remainder of and additionally  we implemented a temporary one percent surcharge in both the second and third 
table of contents quarters of due to inflationary costs due to increases in costs of commodities  while no such surcharges existed in and we increased prices effective in the fourth quarter of the increase in sales volume was largely a result of the above average snow season ending march  net sales of parts and accessories increased in the year ended december  from the year ended december  by  from million to million 
net sales of parts and accessories remained comparatively high in  exceeding the preceding ten year average by approximately 
the comparatively strong sales of parts and accessories was due in large part to above average snowfall resulting in increased equipment usage and subsequent repair 
additionally  equipment sales were only slightly higher above the immediately preceding ten year average  as many end users continue to repair their existing snow and ice control equipment instead of purchasing new equipment 
cost of sales 
cost of sales was million for the year ended december  compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was driven primarily by increased volume as cost of sales as a percentage of total sales did not fluctuate significantly 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  negative inflationary commodity experience throughout the year was more than offset by lower costs per unit resulting from increases in volume of equipment units and parts and accessories 
as a percentage of cost of sales  fixed and variable costs were approximately and  respectively  for the year ended december  versus approximately and  respectively for the year ended december  gross profit 
gross profit was million for the year ended december  compared to million in  an increase of million  or  due to the increase in net sales volume described above under net sales and cost of sales 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased from for the year ended december  to for the corresponding period in  as a result of the factors discussed above under net sales and cost of sales 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses  including intangible asset amortization and management fees  were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  driven by non recurring expenses incurred at the time of the ipo in the non recurring charges associated with the ipo totaled million  and were comprised of the buyout of the management services agreement at million  compensation expense associated with net exercises of stock options totaling million and the expense and payment of cash bonuses under the our liquidity bonus plan of million 
additionally  in there was non recurring compensation expense associated with net exercises of stock options subsequent to the ipo totaling million 
in addition  the closure costs associated with the johnson city facility were million in the prior year 
amortization expense decreased million compared to due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized 
additionally  contributing to the reduction  in  we spent million less on legal and consulting fees compared to in order to defend patents and explore potential acquisitions 
meanwhile  offsetting the decreases  in we incurred higher incentive based compensation of million due to better operating results 
recurring stock based compensation increased million compared to due to a full year as a public company in the current year 
we spent million in on offering costs to allow our former principal stockholders to dispose of their remaining holdings in our common stock 
finally  health insurance costs increased million in the year ended december  compared to as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses  including intangibles amortization and management fees  decreased from for the year ended december  to for the corresponding period in due to items discussed above 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million in the corresponding period in  a decrease of million 
this 
table of contents decrease was due to less interest expense as a result of the redemption of our senior notes due senior notes with proceeds from the ipo  additional borrowings under our senior credit facilities and cash on hand 
additionally  interest expense was lower for year ending december  compared to as we incurred a favorable rate as a result of the april refinancing 
loss on extinguishment of debt 
loss on extinguishment of debt totaling million for the year ended december  was entirely driven by our entry into a new term loan facility resulting in a significant modification of our debt which resulted in the write off of unamortized capitalized deferred financing costs of million and write off of unamortized debt discount of million 
loss on extinguishment of debt totaling million for the year ended december  was entirely driven by costs associated with the amendment of our senior credit facilities and the redemption of the senior notes  including both the call premium on the redemption of our senior notes  and the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs relating to the redemption of our senior notes and the amendment of our senior credit facilities 
income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
the largest item affecting deferred taxes is the difference between book and tax amortization of goodwill and other intangibles amortization 
our effective combined federal and state tax rate for was compared to for the effective tax rate for the year ended december  is higher than due to an increase in federal rate from in year ending december  compared to for the year ending december  net income 
net income for the year ended december  was million compared to net income of million for the corresponding period in  an increase of million 
this increase was driven by the factors described above  and primarily by the non recurring charges associated with the ipo incurred in non gaap financial measures this annual report on form k contains financial information calculated other than in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these non gaap measures include free cash flow  adjusted net income  and adjusted ebitda 
these non gaap disclosures should not be construed as an alternative to the reported results determined in accordance with gaap 
free cash flow as defined below for the year ended december  was million compared to million in  a decrease in free cash flow of million  or 
the decrease in free cash flow is primarily a result of million less cash provided by operating activities  as discussed below under liquidity and capital resources 
in addition to the changes in cash provided by operating activities  capital expenditures decreased by million 
in  there were lower capital expenditures to preserve cash flow following a low snowfall season ending march free cash flow is a non gaap financial measure  which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures 
free cash flow should be evaluated in addition to  and not considered a substitute for  other financial measures such as net income and cash flow provided by operations 
we believe that free cash flow represents our ability to generate additional cash flow from our business operations 

table of contents the following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities  a gaap measure  to free cash flow  a non gaap measure 
for the year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities acquisition of property and equipment free cash flow adjusted net income represents net income as determined under gaap  excluding certain expenses incurred at the time of our ipo in namely the buyout of our management services agreement  loss on extinguishment of debt  stock based compensation expense associated with the net exercise of stock options and the payment of cash bonuses under our liquidity bonus plan  loss on extinguishment of debt incurred in  costs incurred to pursue potential acquisitions in and certain expenses incurred at the time of our secondary offerings in we believe that the presentation of adjusted net income for the years ended december   december  and december  allows investors to make meaningful comparisons of our operating performance between periods and to view our business from the same perspective as our management 
because the excluded items are not predictable or consistent  management does not consider them when evaluating our performance or when making decisions regarding allocation of resources 
the following table presents a reconciliation of net income  the most comparable gaap financial measure  to adjusted net income for the years ending december   december  and december  years ended in millions december  december  december  net income gaap addback non recurring expenses  net of tax at and for and  respectively buyout of management service agreement loss on extinguishment of debt liquidity bonus payment acquisition costs non recurring stock based compensation offering costs adjusted net income non gaap adjusted ebitda represents net income before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  as further adjusted for certain charges consisting of unrelated legal and consulting fees  as well as management fees paid by us to affiliates of our former principal stockholders  stock based compensation  payment of cash bonuses under our liquidity bonus plan  loss on extinguishment of debt and offering costs 
we use  and we believe our investors benefit from the presentation of adjusted ebitda in evaluating our operating performance because it provides us and our investors with additional tools to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations 
in addition  we believe that adjusted ebitda is useful to investors and other external users of our consolidated financial statements in evaluating our operating performance as compared to that of other companies  because it allows them to measure a company operating performance without regard to items such as 
table of contents interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization  which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets and liabilities  capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired 
our management also uses adjusted ebitda for planning purposes  including the preparation of our annual operating budget and financial projections 
management also uses adjusted ebitda to evaluate our ability to make certain payments  including dividends  in compliance with our senior credit facilities  which is determined based on a calculation of consolidated adjusted ebitda that is substantially similar to adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool 
as a result  you should not consider it in isolation  or as a substitute for net income  operating income  cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap 
some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our indebtedness  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  other companies  including other companies in our industry  may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect tax obligations whether current or deferred 
adjusted ebitda for the year ended december  was million compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
as a percentage of net sales  adjusted ebitda decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  adjusted ebitda for the year ended december  was million compared to adjusted ebitda of million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
as a percentage of net sales  adjusted ebitda decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  in addition to the specific changes resulting from the exceptions  the changes to adjusted ebitda for the periods discussed resulted from factors discussed above under results of operations

the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses  and related disclosures 
these estimates and assumptions are often based on judgments that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time made  but all such estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions  and it is possible that other professionals  applying their own judgment to the same facts and circumstances  could develop and support alternative estimates and assumptions that would result in material changes to our operating results and financial condition 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to pension obligations  recovery of accounts receivable  impairment assessment of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  as well as estimates used in the determination of the lower of cost or market value of inventory and liabilities related to taxation and product warranty 
we believe the following are the critical accounting policies that affect our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents defined benefit pension obligation as discussed in note to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  the pension benefit obligation and related pension expense or income of our pension plans are calculated in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  defined benefit plans pension  and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
rates are evaluated on an annual basis considering such factors as market interest rates and historical asset performance 
actuarial valuations for used a discount rate of and an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 
meanwhile  actuarial valuations for used a discount rate of and an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 
our discount rate reflects the expected future cash flow based upon our funding valuation assumptions and participant data at the beginning of the plan year 
the expected future cash flow was discounted by the principal financial group yield curve for the month preceding the year end 
in estimating the expected return on plan assets  we analyze historical and expected returns for multiple asset classes 
the overall rate for each asset class was developed by combining a long term inflation component  the risk free real rate of return  and the associated risk premium 
a weighted average rate was then developed based upon those overall rates and the target asset allocation of the plan 
changes in the discount rate and return on assets can have a significant effect on the funded status of our pension plans  shareholders equity and related expense 
we cannot predict these changes in discount rates or investment returns and  therefore  cannot reasonably estimate whether the impact in subsequent years will be significant 
the funded status of our pension plans is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of its plan assets 
the projected benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of all benefits expected to be earned by our employees service adjusted for future wage increases 
at december   our pension obligation funded status was million underfunded 
our funding policy for our pension plans is to contribute amounts at least equal to the minimum annual amount required by applicable regulations 
we contributed approximately million to our pension plans in and expect to make approximately million in contributions to our pension plans in see note to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for a more detailed description of our pension plans 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts we recognize revenues upon shipment to the customer  which is when risk of loss passes and all of the following conditions are satisfied persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  collectability is reasonably assured  and the product has been shipped and we have no further obligations 
customers have no right of return privileges 
historically  product returns have not been material and are permitted on an exception basis only 
we offer a variety of discounts and sales incentives to our distributors 
the estimated liability for sales discounts and allowances is recorded at the time of sale as a reduction of net sales 
the liability is estimated based on the costs of the program  the planned duration of the program and historical experience 
we carry our accounts receivable at their face amount less an allowance for doubtful accounts 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate our accounts receivable and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of specific distributor circumstances and credit conditions taking into account the history of write offs and collections 
a receivable is considered past due if payment has not been received within the period agreed upon in the invoice 
accounts receivable are written off after all collection efforts have been exhausted 
we take a security interest in the inventory as collateral for the receivable but often do not have a priority security interest 
see note to our audited consolidated 
table of contents financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for further information regarding our allowance for doubtful accounts 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparison of the carrying value of such assets to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
if the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows  an impairment provision is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value of the asset  less costs of disposition 
our management considers such factors as current results  trends and future prospects  current market value  and other economic and regulatory factors in performing these analyses 
we determined that no long lived assets were impaired as of december   and goodwill and other intangible assets we perform an annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite lived trade names and more frequently if an event or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss has been incurred 
conditions that would trigger an impairment assessment include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset 
the analysis of potential impairment of goodwill requires a two step process 
the first step is the estimation of fair value of the applicable reporting unit 
we have determined we have one reporting unit  and all significant decisions are made on a companywide basis by our chief operating decision maker 
the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated by using a market approach 
the estimated fair value is compared with our aggregate carrying value 
if our fair value is greater than the carrying amount  there is no impairment 
if our carrying amount is greater than the fair value  then the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
the second step calculates the implied fair value of the goodwill  which is compared to its carrying value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated by valuing all of the tangible and intangible assets of the reporting unit at the hypothetical fair value  assuming the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
the excess of the fair value of the entire reporting unit over the fair value of its identifiable assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference 
annual impairment tests conducted by us on december   and resulted in no adjustment to the carrying value of our indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill 
our goodwill and trade name balances could be impaired in future periods 
a number of factors  many of which we have no ability to control  could affect our financial condition  operating results and business prospects and could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed 
these factors include a prolonged global economic crisis  a significant decrease in the demand for our products  the inability to develop new and enhanced products and services in a timely manner  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  and successful efforts by our competitors to gain market share in our markets 

table of contents inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
market is determined on the basis of estimated realizable values 
cost is determined using the first in  first out basis 
we periodically review our inventory for slow moving  damaged and discontinued items and provide reserves to reduce such items identified to their recoverable amounts 
income taxes our estimate of income taxes payable  deferred income taxes and the effective tax rate is based on an analysis of many factors including interpretations of federal and state income tax laws  the difference between tax and financial reporting bases and liabilities  estimates of amounts currently due or owed in various jurisdictions  and current accounting standards 
we review and update our estimates on a quarterly basis as facts and circumstances change and actual results are known 
we have generated significant deferred tax assets as a result of goodwill and intangible asset book versus tax differences as well as state net operating loss carryforwards 
in assessing the ability to realize these deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the years in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  excluding those relating to indefinite lived intangible assets  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
as a result of this analysis  we have recorded a valuation allowance against certain of these deferred tax assets 
accruals for uncertain tax positions  if any  are provided for in accordance with the requirements of asc income taxes 
see note to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for further information regarding our accounting for income taxes 
warranty cost recognition we accrue for estimated warranty costs as sales are recognized and periodically assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liability and adjust the amount as necessary 
our warranties generally provide  with respect to our snow and ice control equipment  that all material and workmanship will be free from defect for a period of two years after the date of purchase by the end user  and with respect to our parts and accessories purchased separately  that such parts and accessories will be free from defect for a period of one year after the date of purchase by the end user 
certain snowplows only provide for a one year warranty 
we determine the amount of the estimated warranty costs and our corresponding warranty reserve based on our prior five years of warranty history utilizing a formula driven by historical warranty expense and applying management judgment 
we adjust our historical warranty costs to take into account unique factors such as the introduction of new products into the marketplace that do not provide a historical warranty record to assess 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of cash have been and we expect will continue to be cash from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facilities 
our primary uses of cash are to provide working capital  meet debt service requirements  finance capital expenditures  pay dividends under our dividend policy and support our growth  including through potential acquisitions  and for other general corporate purposes 
for a description of the seasonality of our working capital rates see seasonality and year to year variability 

table of contents our board of directors has adopted a dividend policy that reflects an intention to distribute to our stockholders a regular quarterly cash dividend 
the declaration and payment of these dividends to holders of our common stock is at the discretion of our board of directors and depends upon many factors  including our financial condition and earnings  legal requirements  taxes and other factors our board of directors may deem to be relevant 
the terms of our indebtedness may also restrict us from paying cash dividends on our common stock under certain circumstances 
as a result of this dividend policy  we may not have significant cash available to meet any large unanticipated liquidity requirements 
as a result  we may not retain a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations or to finance unanticipated capital expenditures or growth opportunities  including acquisitions 
our board of directors may  however  amend  revoke or suspend our dividend policy at any time and for any reason 
as of december   we had liquidity comprised of approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and borrowing availability of approximately million under our revolving credit facility 
borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility is governed by a borrowing base  the calculation of which includes cash on hand 
accordingly  use of cash on hand may also result in a reduction in the amount available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
furthermore  our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain at least million of borrowing availability 
we expect that cash on hand  cash generated from operations  as well as available credit under our senior credit facilities will provide adequate funds for the purposes described above for at least the next months 
cash flow analysis set forth below is summary cash flow information for each of the years ended december   and year ended december  cash flows in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities increase decrease in cash sources and uses of cash during the three year periods described above  net cash provided by operating activities was used for funding capital investment  paying dividends  paying interest on both our senior notes and senior credit facilities  and funding working capital requirements during our pre season shipping period 
the following table shows our cash and cash equivalents and inventories at december   and december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents inventories 
table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  compared to cash and cash equivalents of million at december  the table below sets forth a summary of the significant sources and uses of cash for the periods presented 
year ended december  cash flows in thousands change net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities increase decrease in cash net cash provided by operating activities decreased million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due to a decrease in net income adjusted for reconciling items 
negatively impacting cash flow were an income tax receivable balance at december  of million as compared to a million payable position at december combining for a net impact of million 
also  negatively impacting cash flow were decreases in accrued liability balances by million driven by decreased accrued incentive of million and a decrease in accrued sales incentives of million inventory balances increased million as a result of lower sales volumes in negatively impacting cash flows 
slightly offsetting these adverse cash flow items were accounts receivable  which declined million  positively influencing operating cash flows 
net cash used in investing activities decreased million for the year ended december   compared to the corresponding period in this decrease was due to lower capital expenditures in to preserve cash flow in a historically low snowfall year 
net cash used in financing activities increased million for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in in  we made million in repayments of long term debt  including a million voluntary prepayment  refinanced our revolving line of credit and capitalized million in deferred financing costs 
in  we refinanced our term loan  resulting in a net impact of million in cash used as we borrowed million less a million discount and paid and capitalized million of deferred financing costs  offset by debt repayments of million 
we also paid dividends of million in the year ended december   compared to dividends paid of million in the year ended december   and received million in for the exercise of stock options  whereas no options were exercised in year ended december  compared to year ended december  we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  compared to cash and cash equivalents of million at december  the table below sets forth a summary of the significant sources and uses of cash for the periods presented 
year ended december  cash flows in thousands change net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities increase decrease in cash 
table of contents net cash provided by operating activities increased million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to a increase in net income adjusted for reconciling items 
additionally  accounts receivable decline of million and accounts payable increase of million both positively influenced operating cash flows 
as we paid off the senior notes in  accrued interest at the end of declined in million  which increased cash used in operating activities in net cash used in investing activities decreased million for the year ended december   compared to the corresponding period in this decrease was due to higher capital expenditures in to accommodate the increased production demands in milwaukee  wi and rockland  me because of the closure of our johnson city  tn manufacturing plant 
net cash used in financing activities decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in the decrease was a result of our repayment of our senior notes in the amount of million in offsetting cash used were net proceeds from the ipo of million and borrowings under the credit facility of million in as we refinanced our term loan in there was a net impact of million in cash provided to us as we borrowed million less a million discount  offset by debt repayments of million 
we also paid dividends of million in the year ended december   compared to dividends paid of million in the year ended december  we also received million in for the exercise of stock options  wheras all options exercised in were accomplished through net exercises that resulted in no cash paid for the exercise price of the options 
future obligations and commitments contractual obligations we are subject to certain contractual obligations  including long term debt and related interest 
we have net unrecognized tax benefits of million as of december  however  we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of potential cash settlement of the underlying liabilities  therefore  we have not included unrecognized tax benefits in calculating the obligations set forth in the following table of significant contractual obligations as of december  dollars in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt interest on long term debt total contracted cash obligations long term debt obligation is presented net of discount of million at december  assumes all debt will remain outstanding until maturity 
interest payments were calculated using interest rates in effect as of december  pension obligations are excluded from this table as we are unable to estimate the timing of payments related to these obligations 
the minimum required contribution to our pension plans was million in and is expected to be million in senior credit facilities on november   we amended our senior credit facility to increase the borrowing ability under the revolving credit agreement by million 
we did not amend our term loan agreement which we entered into in april of consequently  as of december   our senior credit facilities consisted of a million term loan facility and an million revolving credit facility 
table of contents with a group of banks 
we capitalized deferred financing costs of million associated with the amendment to our senior credit facility 
we did not  however  write off any previously capitalized deferred financing costs as the borrowing capacity with each of the lenders associated with the amended revolving credit facility exceeded the borrowing capacity of the original revolving credit facility 
the agreement for the term loan the term loan credit agreement provides for a senior secured term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of million and generally bears interest at at the our election either i per annum plus the greatest of a the prime rate as defined in the term loan credit agreement in effect on such day  b the weighted average of the rates on overnight federal funds transactions with members of the federal reserve system arranged by federal funds brokers plus and c plus the greater of the london interbank offered rate for a one month interest period multiplied by the statutory reserve rate as defined in the term loan credit agreement and or ii per annum plus the greater of a the london interbank offered rate for the applicable interest period multiplied by the statutory reserve rate and b 
the revolving credit facility as amended and restated the revolving credit and guaranty agreement provides that the we have the option to select whether borrowings will bear interest at either i per annum plus the london interbank offered rate for the applicable interest period multiplied by the statutory reserve rate or ii per annum plus the greatest of a the prime rate in effect on such day  b the weighted average of the rates on overnight federal funds transactions with members of the federal reserve system arranged by federal funds brokers plus and c the london interbank offered rate for a one month interest period multiplied by the statutory reserve rate plus 
the maturity date for our amended and restated revolving credit facility is april   and our term loan amortizes in nominal amounts quarterly with the balance payable on april  the term loan entered into in the second quarter of was issued at a million discount which is being amortized over the term of the term loan 
our entry into the term loan facility in resulted in a significant modification of our debt which resulted in the write off of unamortized capitalized deferred financing costs of million and write off of unamortized debt discount of million which in total resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of million in the consolidated statement of income during the year ended december  at december   we had outstanding borrowings under our term loan of million and no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility and remaining borrowing availability of million 
our senior credit facilities include certain negative and operating covenants  including restrictions on our ability to pay dividends  and other customary covenants  representations and warranties and events of default 
the senior credit facilities entered into and recorded by our subsidiaries significantly restrict our subsidiaries from paying dividends and otherwise transferring assets to us 
the terms of our revolving credit facility specifically restrict subsidiaries from paying dividends if a minimum availability under the revolving credit facility is not maintained  and both senior credit facilities restrict subsidiaries from paying dividends above certain levels or at all if an event of default has occurred 
these restrictions would affect us indirectly since we rely principally on distributions from our subsidiaries to have funds available for the payment of dividends 
in addition  our revolving credit facility includes a requirement that  subject to certain exceptions  capital expenditures may not exceed million in any calendar year and  if certain minimum availability under our revolving credit facility is not maintained  that we comply with a monthly minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test of compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio test is subject to certain cure rights under our revolving credit facility 

table of contents at december   we were in compliance with the covenants in our senior credit facilities 
the credit facilities are collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
in accordance with the senior credit facilities  we are required to make additional principal prepayments over the above scheduled payments under certain conditions 
this includes  in the case of the term loan facility  of the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales  certain insurance or condemnation events  certain debt issuances  and  within days of the end of the fiscal year  of excess cash flow  as defined  including a deduction for certain distributions which percentage is reduced to or upon the achievement of certain leverage ratio thresholds  for any fiscal year 
excess cash flow is defined in the senior credit facilities as consolidated adjusted ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization plus a working capital adjustment less the sum of repayments of debt and capital expenditures subject to certain adjustments  interest and taxes paid in cash  management fees and certain restricted payments including dividends or distributions 
working capital adjustment is defined in the senior credit facilities as the change in working capital  defined as current assets excluding cash and cash equivalents less current liabilities excluding current portion of long term debt 
as of december   we were not required to make an excess cash flow payment 
each of the senior secured facilities entered into in the second quarter of includes a hedge provision  which requires us to enter into an interest rate hedge commencing days after the closing date 
the hedging provision required the company to hedge the interest rate on at least of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the term loans 
the purpose of the interest rate swap is to reduce our exposure to interest rate volatility 
effective june   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million 
the interest rate swap negative fair value at december  of million is included in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
we have counterparty credit risk resulting from the interest rate swap  which we monitors on an on going basis 
this risk lies with one global financial institution 
under the interest rate swap agreement  effective as of july   we either receive or makespayments on a monthly basis based on the differential between and libor plus with a libor floor of 
the interest rate swap contract on the term loan expires in december deductibility of intangible and goodwill expense we possess a favorable tax structure with approximately million of annual tax deductible intangible and goodwill expense over the next eight years which may be utilized in the event we have sufficient taxable income to utilize such benefit 
impact of inflation we do not believe that inflation risk is material to our business or our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows at this time 
historically  we have experienced normal raw material  labor and fringe benefit inflation 
to date we have been able to fully offset this inflation by providing higher value products  which command higher prices 
in previous years  we have experienced significant increases in steel costs  but have been able to mitigate the effects of these increases through both temporary and permanent steel surcharges 
see risk factors the price of steel  a commodity necessary to manufacture our products  is highly variable 
if the price of steel increases  our gross margins could decline 
off balance sheet arrangements we are not party to any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues  expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 

table of contents seasonality and year to year variability our business is seasonal and also varies from year to year 
consequently  our results of operations and financial condition vary from quarter to quarter and from year to year as well 
in addition  because of this seasonality and variability  our results of operations for any quarter may not be indicative of results of operations that may be achieved for a subsequent quarter or the full year  and may not be similar to results of operations experienced in prior years 
sales of our products are significantly impacted by the level  timing and location of snowfall  with sales in any given year and region most heavily influenced by snowfall levels in the prior snow season which we consider to begin in october and end in march in that region 
this is due to the fact that end user demand for our products is driven primarily by the condition of their snow and ice control equipment  and in the case of professional snowplowers  by their financial ability to purchase new or replacement snow and ice control equipment  both of which are significantly affected by snowfall levels 
heavy snowfall during a given winter causes usage of our products to increase  resulting in greater wear and tear to our products and a shortening of their life cycles  thereby creating a need for replacement snow and ice control equipment and related parts and accessories 
in addition  when there is a heavy snowfall in a given winter  the increased income our professional snowplowers generate from their professional snowplow activities provides them with increased purchasing power to purchase replacement snow and ice control equipment prior to the following winter 
to a lesser extent  sales of our products are influenced by the timing of snowfall in a given winter 
because an early snowfall can be viewed as a sign of a heavy upcoming snow season  our end users may respond to an early snowfall by purchasing replacement snow and ice control equipment during the current season rather that delaying purchases until after the season is over when most purchases are typically made by end users 
the following chart illustrates the effects of snowfall levels in the snowbelt states in a given winter on the number of units of snow and ice control equipment we shipped in the following year 
snowfall levels represent the aggregate number of inches of snowfall recorded in each of cities in snowbelt states across the northeast  east  midwest and western united states where we have historically monitored snowfall levels 
we have historically monitored snowfall levels in these cities because they represent the key metropolitan areas in the states where snowfall is a regular occurrence and coincide with our historical us market 
with respect to the calculation of units shipped  each year in the following chart represents the calendar year period from january to december with respect to the calculation of snowfall  each year in the following chart represents the period beginning on october of the prior year and extending through the following march thus  for example  the number of units shipped in represents the total units of snow and ice control equipment we shipped from january  to december   whereas the snowfall level reflects snowfall in the snowbelt states in the period from october  through march  as the chart indicates  heavy snowfall levels in a given winter tend to lead to increased unit shipments of our snow and ice control equipment in the following year  whereas low snowfall levels in a given winter tend to lead to decreased units shipped of our snow and ice control equipment in the following year 
over the past years  our sales of snow and ice control equipment ranged from a low of  units to a high of  units  averaging  units per year including units sold by blizzard corporation prior to its acquisition by us in november 

table of contents equipment sales versus snowfall graphic note this chart is not weighted or adjusted to account for new distributors or increased market size  but does include unit sales attributable to new distributors 
further  snowfall data in this chart is not adjusted for snowfall outside of the cities in the states reflected 
units of equipment sales for years through are adjusted to include units sold by blizzard corporation prior to its acquisition by us in november source of snowfall data national oceanic and atmospheric administration national weather service snowfall levels in any given rolling eight year period have been relatively constant 
see business our industry 
we attempt to manage the seasonal impact of snowfall on our revenues in part through our pre season sales program  which involves actively soliciting and encouraging pre season distributor orders in the second and third quarters by offering our distributors a combination of pricing  payment and freight incentives during this period 
these pre season sales incentives encourage our distributors to re stock their inventory during the second and third quarters in anticipation of the peak fourth quarter retail sales period by offering favorable pre season pricing and payment deferral until the fourth quarter 
as a result  we tend to generate our greatest volume of sales an average of over two thirds over the last ten years during the second and third quarters  providing us with manufacturing visibility for the remainder of the year 
by contrast  our revenue and operating results tend to be lowest during the first quarter as management believes our end users prefer to wait until the beginning of a snow season to purchase new equipment and as our distributors sell off inventory and wait for our pre season sales incentive period to re stock inventory 
fourth quarter sales vary from year to year as they are primarily driven by the level  timing and location of snowfall during the quarter 
this is because most of our fourth quarter sales and shipments consist of re orders by distributors seeking to restock inventory to meet immediate customer needs caused by snowfall during the winter months 
our revenue and operating results tend to be lowest during the first quarter  during which period we typically experience negative earnings as the snow season draws to a close 
our first quarter revenue has varied from approximately million to approximately million between and during the last five year period  net loss during the first quarter has varied from a net loss of approximately million to a net loss of approximately million  with an average net loss of million 

table of contents while our monthly working capital has averaged approximately million from to  because of the seasonality of our sales  we experience seasonality in our working capital needs as well 
in the first quarter we require capital as we are generally required to build our inventory in anticipation of our second and third quarter sales seasons 
during the second and third quarters  our working capital requirements rise as our accounts receivables increase as a result of the sale and shipment of products ordered through our pre season sales program and we continue to build inventory 
working capital requirements peak towards the end of the third quarter reaching an average peak of approximately million over the prior three years and then begin to decline through the fourth quarter through a reduction in accounts receivables as it is in the fourth quarter that we receive a majority of the payments for previously shipped products 
we also attempt to manage the impact of seasonality and year to year variability on our business costs through the effective management of our assets 
see business our business strategy aggressive asset management and profit focus 
our asset management and profit focus strategies include the employment of a highly variable cost structure facilitated by a core group of workers that we supplement with a temporary workforce as sales volumes dictate  which allows us to adjust costs on an as needed basis in response to changing demand  our enterprise wide lean concept  which allows us to adjust production levels up or down to meet demand  the pre season order program described above  which incentivizes distributors to place orders prior to the retail selling season  and a vertically integrated business model 
these asset management and profit focus strategies  among other management tools  allow us to adjust fixed overhead and sales  general and administrative expenditures to account for the year to year variability of our sales volumes 
management currently estimates that annual fixed overhead expenses generally range from approximately million in low sales volume years to approximately million in high sales volume years 
further  management currently estimates that annual sales  general and administrative expenses other than amortization generally approximate million  but can be reduced to approximately million to maximize cash flow in low sales volume years  and can increase to approximately million to maintain customer service and responsiveness in high sales volume years 
additionally  although modest  our annual capital expenditure requirements  which are normally budgeted at million  can be temporarily reduced by up to approximately in response to actual or anticipated decreases in sales volumes 
if we are unsuccessful in our asset management initiatives  the seasonality and year to year variability effects on our business may be compounded and in turn our results of operations and financial condition may suffer 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not use financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  and do not hold any derivative financial instruments that could expose us to significant market risk 
our primary market risk exposures are changes in interest rates and steel price fluctuations 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates 
our borrowings  including our term loan and any revolving borrowings under our senior credit facilities  are at variable rates of 
table of contents interest and expose us to interest rate risk 
a portion of our interest rate risk associated with our term loan is mitigated through an interest rate swap as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the interest rate on any revolving borrowings is subject to an increase in the interest rate based on our average daily availability under our revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had outstanding borrowings under our term loan of million 
a hypothetical interest rate change of  and on our term loan would have changed interest incurred for the year ended december  by million  million and million  respectively 
we have entered into an interest rate swap  which became effective beginning july and matures december  to hedge the variability in future cash flows associated with our variable rate term loans 
the swap converts million of our term loan to a fixed interest rate of 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
commodity price risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risk related to our purchase of steel  the primary commodity upon which our manufacturing depends 
while steel is typically available from numerous suppliers  the price of steel is a commodity subject to fluctuations that apply across broad spectrums of the steel market 
we do not use any derivative or hedging instruments to manage the price risk 
if the price of steel increases  our variable costs could also increase 
while historically we have successfully mitigated these increased costs through the implementation of either permanent price increases and or temporary invoice surcharges  in the future we may not be able to successfully mitigate these costs  which could cause our gross margins to decline 
if our costs for steel were to increase by in a period in which we were not able to pass any of this increase onto our distributors  our gross margins would decline by in that period
