critical accounting policies basis of presentation the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions affecting amounts reported in the company s consolidated financial statements 
we have identified investment valuation  revenue recognition and the recognition of capital gains incentive fee expense as our most critical accounting estimates 
we continuously evaluate our estimates  including those related to the matters described below 
these estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
a discussion of our critical accounting policies follows 
investment valuation the company accounts for its investments at fair value in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures asc 
asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 
asc requires the company to assume that its investments are to be sold at the statement of assets and liabilities date in the principal market to independent market participants  or in the absence of a principal market  in the most advantageous market  which may be a hypothetical market 
market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent  knowledgeable  and willing and able to transact 
investments for which market quotations are readily available are fair valued at such market quotations obtained from independent third party pricing services and market makers subject to any decision by our board of directors to approve a fair value determination to reflect significant events affecting the value of these investments 
we value investments for which market quotations are not readily available at fair value as approved  in good faith  by our board of directors based on input from saratoga investment advisers  the audit committee of our board of directors and a third party independent valuation firm 
determinations of fair value may involve subjective judgments and estimates 
the types of factors that may be considered in determining the fair value of our investments include the nature and realizable value of any collateral  the portfolio company s ability to make payments  market yield trend analysis  the markets in which the portfolio company does business  comparison to publicly traded companies  discounted cash flow and other relevant factors 
we undertake a multi step valuation process each quarter when valuing investments for which market quotations are not readily available  as described below each investment is initially valued by the responsible investment professionals of saratoga investment advisors and preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and discussed with our senior management  and an independent valuation firm engaged by our board of directors reviews approximately one quarter of these preliminary valuations each quarter so that the valuation of each investment for which market quotes are not readily available is reviewed by the independent valuation firm at least annually 

table of contents in addition  all our investments are subject to the following valuation process the audit committee of our board of directors reviews each preliminary valuation and saratoga investment advisors and independent valuation firm if applicable will supplement the preliminary valuation to reflect any comments provided by the audit committee  and our board of directors discusses the valuations and approves the fair value of each investment  in good faith  based on the input of saratoga investment advisors  independent valuation firm to the extent applicable and the audit committee of our board of directors 
our investment in gsc investment corp 
clo  ltd 
saratoga clo is carried at fair value  which is based on a discounted cash flow model that utilizes prepayment  re investment and loss assumptions based on historical experience and projected performance  economic factors  the characteristics of the underlying cash flow  and comparable yields for equity interests in collateralized loan obligation funds similar to saratoga clo  when available  as determined by s a and recommended to our board of directors 
specifically  we use intex cash flow models  or an appropriate substitute  to form the basis for the valuation of our investment in saratoga clo 
the models use a set of assumptions including projected default rates  recovery rates  reinvestment rate and prepayment rates in order to arrive at estimated valuations 
the assumptions are based on available market data and projections provided by third parties as well as management estimates 
we use the output from the intex models ie  the estimated cash flows to perform a discounted cash flows analysis on expected future cash flows to determine a valuation for our investment in saratoga clo 
revenue recognition income recognition interest income  adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount  is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected 
the company stops accruing interest on its investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible 
discounts and premiums on investments purchased are accreted amortized over the life of the respective investment using the effective yield method 
the amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the accretion of discounts and amortizations of premium on investments 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected 
accrued interest is generally reserved when a loan is placed on non accrual status 
interest payments received on non accrual loans may be recognized as a reduction in principal depending upon management s judgment regarding collectability 
non accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and  in management s judgment  are likely to remain current  although we may make exceptions to this general rule if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection 
interest income on our investment in saratoga clo is recorded using the effective interest method in accordance with the provisions of asc topic  investments other  beneficial interests in securitized financial assets  based on the anticipated yield and the estimated cash flows over the projected life of the investment 
yields are revised when there are changes in actual or estimated cash flows due to changes in prepayments and or re investments  credit losses or asset pricing 
changes in estimated yield are recognized as an adjustment to the estimated yield over the remaining life of the investment from the date the estimated yield was changed 
paid in kind interest the company holds debt investments in its portfolio that contain a payment in kind pik interest provision 
the pik interest  which represents contractually deferred interest added to the investment balance that is generally due at maturity  is generally recorded on the accrual basis to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected 
we stop accruing pik interest if we do not expect the issuer to be able to pay all principal and interest when due 
capital gains incentive fee the company records an expense accrual relating to the capital gains incentive fee payable by the company to its investment adviser when the unrealized gains on its investments exceed all realized capital losses on its investments given the fact that a capital gains incentive fee would be owed to the investment adviser if the company were to liquidate its investment portfolio at such time 
the actual incentive fee payable to the company s investment adviser related to capital gains will be determined and payable in arrears at the end of each fiscal year and will include only realized capital gains for the period 

table of contents revenues we generate revenue in the form of interest income and capital gains on the debt investments that we hold and capital gains  if any  on equity interests that we may acquire 
we expect our debt investments  whether in the form of leveraged loans or mezzanine debt  to have terms of up to ten years  and to bear interest at either a fixed or floating rate 
interest on debt will be payable generally either quarterly or semi annually 
in some cases  our debt investments may provide for a portion of the interest to be paid in kind pik 
to the extent interest is paid in kind  it will be payable through the increase of the principal amount of the obligation by the amount of interest due on the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of such obligation 
the principal amount of the debt and any accrued but unpaid interest will generally become due at the maturity date 
in addition  we may generate revenue in the form of commitment  origination  structuring or diligence fees  fees for providing managerial assistance or investment management services and possibly consulting fees 
any such fees will be generated in connection with our investments and recognized as earned 
we may also invest in preferred equity securities that pay dividends on a current basis 
on january   we entered into a collateral management agreement with saratoga clo  pursuant to which we act as its collateral manager and receive a senior collateral management fee of and a subordinate collateral management fee of of the outstanding principal amount of saratoga clo s assets  paid quarterly to the extent of available proceeds 
we are also entitled to an incentive management fee equal to of excess cash flow to the extent the saratoga clo subordinated notes receive an internal rate of return equal to or greater than 
we recognize interest income on our investment in the subordinated notes of saratoga clo using the effective interest method  based on the anticipated yield and the estimated cash flows over the projected life of the investment 
yields are revised when there are changes in actual or estimated cash flows due to changes in prepayments and or re investments  credit losses or asset pricing 
changes in estimated yield are recognized as an adjustment to the estimated yield over the remaining life of the investment from the date the estimated yield was changed 
expenses our primary operating expenses include the payment of investment advisory and management fees  professional fees  directors and officers insurance  fees paid to independent directors and administrator expenses  including our allocable portion of our administrator s overhead 
our investment advisory and management fees compensate our investment adviser for its work in identifying  evaluating  negotiating  closing and monitoring our investments 
we bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions  including those relating to organization  calculating our net asset value including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm  expenses incurred by our investment adviser payable to third parties  including agents  consultants or other advisers  in monitoring our financial and legal affairs and in monitoring our investments and performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies  interest payable on debt  if any  incurred to finance our investments  offerings of our common stock and other securities  investment advisory and management fees  fees payable to third parties  including agents  consultants or other advisers  relating to  or associated with  evaluating and making investments  transfer agent and custodial fees  federal and state registration fees  all costs of registration and listing our common stock on any securities exchange  
table of contents federal  state and local taxes  independent directors fees and expenses  costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents required by governmental bodies including the sec and the sba  costs of any reports  proxy statements or other notices to common stockholders including printing costs  our fidelity bond  directors and officers errors and omissions liability insurance  and any other insurance premiums  direct costs and expenses of administration  including printing  mailing  long distance telephone  copying  secretarial and other staff  independent auditors and outside legal costs  and administration fees and all other expenses incurred by us or  if applicable  the administrator in connection with administering our business including payments under the administration agreement based upon our allocable portion of the administrator s overhead in performing its obligations under an administration agreement  including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of our officers and their respective staffs including travel expenses 
pursuant to the investment advisory and management agreement that we had with gscp nj  lp  our former investment adviser and administrator  we had agreed to pay gscp nj  lp as investment adviser a quarterly base management fee of of the average value of our total assets other than cash or cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed funds at the end of the two most recently completed fiscal quarters  and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the applicable fiscal quarter  and an incentive fee 
the incentive fee had two parts a fee  payable quarterly in arrears  equal to of our pre incentive fee net investment income  expressed as a rate of return on the value of the net assets at the end of the immediately preceding quarter  that exceeded a quarterly annualized hurdle rate measured as of the end of each fiscal quarter 
under this provision  in any fiscal quarter  our investment adviser received no incentive fee unless our pre incentive fee net investment income exceeded the hurdle rate of 
amounts received as a return of capital were not included in calculating this portion of the incentive fee 
since the hurdle rate was based on net assets  a return of less than the hurdle rate on total assets could still have resulted in an incentive fee 
a fee  payable at the end of each fiscal year  equal to of our net realized capital gains  if any  computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation  in each case on a cumulative basis  less the aggregate amount of capital gains incentive fees paid to the investment adviser through such date 
we deferred cash payment of any incentive fee otherwise earned by our former investment adviser if  during the then most recent four full fiscal quarters ending on or prior to the date such payment was to be made  the sum of a our aggregate distributions to our stockholders and b our change in net assets defined as total assets less liabilities before taking into account any incentive fees payable during that period was less than of our net assets at the beginning of such period 
these calculations were appropriately pro rated for the first three fiscal quarters of operation and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the applicable period 
such incentive fee would become payable on the next date on which such test had been satisfied for the most recent four full fiscal quarters or upon certain terminations of the investment advisory and management agreement 
we commenced deferring cash payment of incentive fees during the quarterly period ended august   and continued to defer such payments through the quarterly period ended may  as of july   the date on which gscp nj  lp ceased to be our investment adviser and administrator  we owed gscp nj  lp million in fees for services previously provided to us  of which million has been paid by us 
gscp nj  lp agreed to waive payment by us of the remaining million in connection with the consummation of the stock purchase transaction with saratoga investment advisors and certain of its affiliates described elsewhere in this annual report 

table of contents the terms of the investment advisory and management agreement with saratoga investment advisors  our current investment adviser  are substantially similar to the terms of the investment advisory and management agreement we had entered into with gscp nj  lp  our former investment adviser  except for the following material distinctions in the fee terms the capital gains portion of the incentive fee was reset with respect to gains and losses from may   and therefore losses and gains incurred prior to such time will not be taken into account when calculating the capital gains fee payable to saratoga investment advisors and  as a result  saratoga investment advisors will be entitled to of net gains that arise after may  in addition  the cost basis for computing realized gains and losses on investments held by us as of may  equal the fair value of such investment as of such date 
under the investment advisory and management agreement with our former investment adviser  gscp nj  lp  the capital gains fee was calculated from march   and the gains were substantially outweighed by losses 
under the catch up provision  of our pre incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre incentive fee net investment income that exceeds annualized but is less than or equal to in any fiscal quarter is payable to saratoga investment advisors 
this will enable saratoga investment advisors to receive of all net investment income as such amount approaches in any quarter  and saratoga investment advisors will receive of any additional net investment income 
under the investment advisory and management agreement with our former investment adviser  gscp nj  lp only received of the excess net investment income over 
we will no longer have deferral rights regarding incentive fees in the event that the distributions to stockholders and change in net assets is less than for the preceding four fiscal quarters 
to the extent that any of our leveraged loans are denominated in a currency other than us dollars  we may enter into currency hedging contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
we may also enter into interest rate hedging agreements 
such hedging activities  which will be subject to compliance with applicable legal requirements  may include the use of interest rate caps  futures  options and forward contracts 
costs incurred in entering into or settling such contracts will be borne by us

on february   we amended our senior secured revolving credit facility with madison capital funding llc to  among other things expand the borrowing capacity under the credit facility from million to million  extend the revolving period from july  to february   and remove the condition that we may not acquire additional loan assets without the prior written consent of the administrative agent 
as of february   we had million outstanding under the replacement facility and million sba guaranteed debentures outstanding which are discussed below 
our borrowing base under the replacement facility was million at february  our asset coverage ratio  as defined in the act  was and for the years ended february  and february   respectively

the number of shares of common stock comprising the stock portion was calculated based on a price of per share  which equaled the volume weighted average trading price per share of the common stock on december and  we intend to continue to generate cash primarily from cash flows from operations  including interest earned from the temporary investment of cash in us government securities and other high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less  future borrowings and future offerings of securities 
although we expect to fund the growth of our investment portfolio through the net proceeds from future equity offerings  including our dividend reinvestment plan  and issuances of senior securities or future borrowings  to the extent permitted by the act  our plans to raise capital may not be successful 
in this regard  because our common stock has at times traded at a price below our then current net asset value per share and we are limited in our ability to sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share  we may be limited in our ability to raise equity capital 
our stockholders approved a proposal at our annual meeting of stockholders held on september  that authorizes us to sell shares of our common stock at not less than of the then current net asset value per share in one or more offerings for a period ending on the earlier of september  or the date of our next annual meeting of stockholders 
we would need stockholder approval of a similar proposal to issue shares below net asset value per share at any time after our next annual meeting of stockholders 
in addition  we intend to distribute to our stockholders substantially all of our taxable income in order to satisfy the distribution requirement applicable to rics under subchapter m of the code 
in satisfying this distribution requirement  we have in the past relied on irs issued private letter rulings concluding that a ric may treat a distribution of its own stock as fulfilling its ric distribution requirements if each stockholder may elect to receive his or her entire distribution in either cash or stock of the ric subject to a limitation on the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders  which limitation must be at least of the aggregate declared distribution 
we may rely on these irs private letter rulings in future periods to satisfy our ric distribution requirement 
also  as a bdc  we generally are required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets  less liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities  to total senior securities  which include all of our borrowings and any outstanding preferred stock  of at least 
this requirement limits the amount that we may borrow 
to fund growth in our investment portfolio in the future  we anticipate needing to raise additional capital from various sources  including the equity markets and other debt related markets  which may or may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
consequently  we may not have the funds or the ability to fund new investments  to make additional investments in our portfolio companies  to fund our unfunded commitments to portfolio companies or to repay borrowings 
also  the illiquidity of our portfolio investments may make it difficult for us to sell these investments when desired and  if we are required to sell these investments  we may realize significantly less than their recorded value 
finally  we  through a wholly owned subsidiary  sought and obtained a license from the sba to operate an sbic 
in this regard  on march   our wholly owned subsidiary  saratoga investment corp 
sbic  lp  received a license from the sba to operate as an sbic under section c of the small business investment act of sbics are designated to stimulate the flow of private equity capital to eligible small businesses 
under sba regulations  sbics may make loans to eligible small businesses and invest in the equity securities of small businesses 

table of contents the sbic license allows our sbic subsidiary to obtain leverage by issuing sba guaranteed debentures  subject to the issuance of a capital commitment by the sba and other customary procedures 
sba guaranteed debentures are non recourse  interest only debentures with interest payable semi annually and have a ten year maturity 
the principal amount of sba guaranteed debentures is not required to be paid prior to maturity but may be prepaid at any time without penalty 
the interest rate of sba guaranteed debentures is fixed on a semi annual basis at a market driven spread over us treasury notes with year maturities 
sba regulations currently limit the amount that our sbic subsidiary may borrow to a maximum of million when it has at least million in regulatory capital  receives a capital commitment from the sba and has been through an examination by the sba subsequent to licensing 
as of february   our sbic subsidiary had million in regulatory capital and million sba guaranteed debentures outstanding 
we received exemptive relief from the sec to permit us to exclude the debt of our sbic subsidiary guaranteed by the sba from our asset coverage test under the act 
this allows us increased flexibility under the asset coverage test by permitting us to borrow up to million more than we would otherwise be able to absent the receipt of this exemptive relief 
we cannot provide any assurance that these measures will provide sufficient sources of liquidity to support our operations and growth 
contractual obligations the following table shows our payment obligations for repayment of debt and other contractual obligations at february  payment due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt obligations off balance sheet arrangements at february  and february   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
recent developments in may  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of our unsecured notes due for net proceeds of million after deducting underwriting commissions of million and offering costs of million 
the proceeds included the underwriters full exercise of their overallotment option 
interest on these notes is paid quarterly in arrears on february  may  august and november  at a rate of per year  beginning august  the notes mature on may  and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after may  the notes are listed on the nyse under the trading symbol saq with a par value of per share 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our business activities contain elements of market risk 
we consider our principal market risk to be the fluctuation in interest rates 
managing this risk is essential to our business 
accordingly  we have systems and procedures designed to identify and analyze our risks  to establish appropriate policies and thresholds and to continually monitor this risk and thresholds by means of administrative and information technology systems and other policies and processes 
interest rate risk is defined as the sensitivity of our current and future earnings to interest rate volatility  including relative changes in different interest rates  variability of spread relationships  the difference in re pricing intervals between our assets and liabilities and the effect that interest rates may have on our cash flows 
changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and our interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing debt and liabilities 
changes in interest rates can also affect  among other things  our ability to acquire leveraged loans  high yield bonds and other debt investments and the value of our investment portfolio 
our investment income is affected by fluctuations in various interest rates  including libor and the prime rate 
a large portion of our portfolio is  and we expect will continue to be  comprised of floating rate investments that utilize libor 
our interest expense is affected by fluctuations in libor 
at february   we had million of borrowings outstanding 
we have analyzed the potential impact of changes in interest rates on interest income from investments net of interest expense on the replacement facility 
assuming that our investments as of february  were to remain constant for a full fiscal year and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate terms  a hypothetical change of in interest rates would cause a corresponding increase of approximately million to our interest income net of interest expense 

table of contents although management believes that this measure is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes  it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality  size and composition of the assets on the statement of assets and liabilities and other business developments that could magnify or diminish our sensitivity to interest rate changes  nor does it account for divergences in libor and the commercial paper rate  which have historically moved in tandem but  in times of unusual credit dislocations  have experienced periods of divergence 
accordingly no assurances can be given that actual results would not materially differ from the potential outcome simulated by this estimate
