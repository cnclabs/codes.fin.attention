item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion reviews and analyzes the consolidated results of operations for the past three fiscal years and other factors that may affect future financial performance 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes to the consolidated financial statements and selected financial data 
recent trends in financial markets during the fiscal year ended june   global financial markets responded positively to the change in leadership at the european central bank ecb 
the head of the ecb  mario draghi  declared in late july that the ecb would do whatever it takes to save the euro  and by doing so has put the central bank s credibility on the line 
this was a big confidence boost for the market  which was looking for leadership out of europe and was a significant driver of the improvement in sentiment and global equity market performance in the second half of the federal reserve fed also followed up with another round of quantitative easing qe in september  an open ended mandate to purchase billion in mortgages per month until the fed believes it is no longer necessary to do so 
late in the year  the fed also rolled over the expiring operation twist into an additional billion monthly quantitative easing program 
the fed is on pace for a trillion dollars in qe if this pace continues throughout also late last year a change in leadership in japan led to aggressive government policy changes  including both the fiscal and monetary policy  and the bank of japan s qe program is almost as large as the fed s 
this initially provided a boost to all risky assets but  as the months have passed  the biggest beneficiary has primarily been the us equity market as gold  commodities and emerging markets are generally flat to down over the past twelve months 
as a consequence of these events  us domestic equity mutual funds have seen asset flows while investments in emerging markets  commodity related equities  fixed income and cash have experienced outflows in recent months 
the volatility in the company s revenue is correlated to the price swings in natural resources and emerging markets  which represent roughly percent of assets under management 
during the past fiscal year  us stocks and the us dollar have been positive  while emerging markets stocks and commodity related stocks generally have been lagging in performance 
for the past years  the one year normal volatility of one standard deviation has been percent for the s p index  approximately percent for the msci emerging markets index and nearly percent for gold equities 
to manage expenses  the company maintains a flexible structure for one of its largest costs  compensation expense  by setting relatively lower base salaries with bonuses that are related to average assets under management and fund performance 
thus  our expense model expands and contracts with asset swings and performance 
business segments the company  with principal operations located in san antonio  texas  manages two business segments the company offers a broad range of investment management products and services to meet the needs of individual and institutional investors  and the company invests for its own account in an effort to add growth and value to its cash position 
although the company generates the majority of its revenues from its investment advisory segment  the company holds a significant amount of its total assets in investments 
the following is a brief discussion of the company s two business segments 

table of contents investment management products and services the company generates substantially all of its operating revenues from managing and servicing the funds and other advisory clients 
these revenues are largely dependent on the total value and composition of assets under its management 
fluctuations in the markets and investor sentiment directly impact the funds asset levels  thereby affecting income and results of operations

usfunds 
com  including performance information for each fund for various time periods  assets under management as of the most recent month end  and inception date of each fund

frank holmes  ceo  serves as a director of the offshore clients 
on june   total assets under management as of period end  including both sec registered funds and offshore clients  were billion versus billion on june   a decrease of percent 
during fiscal year  average assets under management were billion versus billion in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to market depreciation in the natural resources funds and redemptions in the natural resources and emerging markets funds under management

the money market funds experienced a net decrease as shareholders sought alternatives to low yields for all periods 
while stock market performance for domestic us equities has been steadily rising  while equities linked to gold and broader natural resources  where most of the assets managed by the company are invested  were generally volatile and declining 
the global financial crisis and subsequent volatility in markets  combined with fund performance  were significant factors in the shareholder activity shown in all periods

the average investment management fee for the money market and fixed income funds was nil or close to nil for fiscal year   and this is due to voluntary fee waivers on these funds as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  including a voluntary agreement to support the yields for the money market funds

investment advisory fees  the largest component of the company s revenues  are derived from two sources sec registered mutual fund advisory fees  which in fiscal year accounted for percent of the company s total advisory fees  and offshore investment advisory fees  which accounted for three percent of total advisory fees 
sec registered mutual fund investment advisory fees are calculated as a percentage of average net assets  ranging from percent to percent  and are paid monthly 
these advisory fees decreased by approximately million  or percent  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year primarily as a result of decreased assets under management due to market depreciation and shareholder redemptions in the natural resources and emerging markets funds 
mutual fund investment advisory fees are also affected by changes in assets under management  which include market appreciation or depreciation  the addition of new client accounts  client contributions of additional assets to existing accounts  withdrawals of assets from and termination of client accounts  exchanges of assets between accounts or products with different fee structures  and the amount of fees voluntarily reimbursed 
the fees on the nine equity usgif funds consist of a base advisory fee that is adjusted upward or downward by percent if there is a performance difference of percent or more between a fund s performance and that of its designated benchmark index over the prior rolling months

in addition  the company collects custodial fees on iras and other types of retirement plans invested in usgif 
transfer agent fees are therefore significantly affected by the number of client accounts 
the company also receives shareholder servicing fees based on the value of the funds held through broker dealer platforms 

table of contents transfer agent fees decreased by  and  in fiscal years and  respectively  primarily as a result of a decline in the number of shareholder accounts and number of transactions 
the company s board of directors formally agreed on august   to exit the transfer agency business so that the company could focus more on its core strength of investment management 
on august   the funds board of trustees agreed to continue the existing transfer agency contract with ussi until conversion to the new transfer agent  which is projected to be in december transfer agent fees are based on the number of shareholder accounts as well as transactions and activity of shareholders 
therefore  the change in the company s revenue cannot be precisely estimated

critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  and expenses 
management reviews these estimates on an ongoing basis 
estimates are based on experience and on various other assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or 
table of contents conditions 
while recent accounting policies are described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company believes the accounting policies that require management to make assumptions and estimates involving significant judgment are those relating to valuation of investments  income taxes  and valuation of stock based compensation 
investments 
the company classifies its investments based on intent at the time of purchase and reevaluates and whether the company is able to exercise significant influence such designation as of each reporting period date 
the company records security transactions on trade date 
realized gains losses from security transactions are calculated on the first in first out cost basis  unless otherwise identifiable  and are recorded in earnings on the date of sale 
trading securities 
securities that are purchased and held principally for the purpose of selling in the near term are classified as trading securities and reported at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on these securities are included in earnings 
held to maturity securities 
investments in debt securities that are purchased with the intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held to maturity and measured at amortized cost 
the company currently has no investments in debt securities 
available for sale securities 
investments that are neither trading securities nor held to maturity securities and for which the company does not have significant influence are classified as available for sale securities and reported at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on these available for sale securities are excluded from earnings  reported net of tax as a separate component of shareholders equity  and recorded in earnings on the date of sale 
the company evaluates its available for sale investments for other than temporary decline in value on a periodic basis 
this may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the current value for an extended period of time 
when a security in the company s investment portfolio has an unrealized loss in fair value that is deemed to be other than temporary  the company reduces the book value of such security to its current fair value  recognizing the credit related decline as a realized loss in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income and a revised gaap cost basis for the security is established 
for available for sale securities with declines in value deemed other than temporary  the unrealized loss recorded net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income is realized as a charge to net income 
equity method investments 
investments classified as equity method consist of investments in companies in which the company is able to exercise significant influence but not control 
under the equity method of accounting  the company s proportional share of investee s underlying net income or loss is recorded as a component of other income and increases or decreases to the carrying value of the investee 
distributions received from the investment reduce the company s carrying value of the investee 
these investments are evaluated for impairment if events or circumstances arise that indicates that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
no impairment has been recognized for the company s equity investment during the years presented 
income taxes 
the company s annual effective income tax rate is based on the mix of income and losses in its us and us entities which are part of the company s consolidated financial statements  statutory tax rates  and tax planning opportunities available to the company in the various jurisdictions in which it operates 
significant judgment is required in evaluating the company s tax positions 
tax law requires certain items to be included in the tax return at different times from when these items are reflected in the company s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income 
as a result  the effective tax rate reflected in the consolidated financial statements is different from the tax rate reported on the company s consolidated tax return 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in the tax return  and some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation expense 
these timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting 
table of contents and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment dates 
in addition  excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises also create a difference between the tax rate used in the consolidated tax return and the effective tax rate in the company s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income 
the company assesses uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting standards codification asc income taxes 
judgment is used to identify  recognize  and measure the amounts to be recorded in the financial statements related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
a liability is recognized to represent the potential future obligation to the taxing authority for the benefit taken in the tax return 
these liabilities are adjusted  including any impact of the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
judgment is used in classifying unrecognized tax benefits as either current or noncurrent liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 
a liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits will generally be classified as a noncurrent liability because there will usually be a period of several years between the filing of the tax return and the final resolution of an uncertain tax position with the taxing authority 
favorable resolutions of tax matters for which reserves have been established are recognized as a reduction to income tax expense when the amounts involved become known 
assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s consolidated financial statements or tax returns requires judgment 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award  and the cost is recognized as expense ratably over the award s vesting period 
no options were granted in fiscal years or the company measured the fair value of stock option granted in fiscal year for  shares on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
the company believes that the estimates related to stock based compensation expense are critical accounting estimates because the assumptions used could significantly impact the timing and amount of stock based compensation expense recorded in the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures the company s balance sheet includes assets whose fair value is subject to market risk 
due to the company s investments in equity securities  equity price fluctuations represent a market risk factor affecting the company s consolidated financial position 
the carrying values of investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices or  if not actively traded  management s estimate of fair value as of the balance sheet date 
market prices fluctuate  and the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may differ significantly from the reported market value 
the company s investment activities are reviewed and monitored by company compliance personnel  and various reports are provided to certain investment advisory clients 
written procedures are in place to manage compliance with the code of ethics and other policies affecting the company s investment practices 
the table below summarizes the company s equity price risks as of june   and shows the effects of a hypothetical percent increase and a percent decrease in market prices 
fair value at june  hypothetical percentage change estimated fair value after hypothetical price change increase decrease in shareholders equity  net of tax trading securities  increase   decrease   available for sale  increase   decrease   unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings in the statement of operations 
unrealized and realized gains and losses on available for sale securities are excluded from earnings and recorded in other comprehensive income as a component of shareholders equity until realized 
the selected hypothetical changes do not reflect what could be considered best or worst case scenarios 
results could be significantly different due to both the nature of equity markets and the concentration of the company s investment portfolio
