item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section entitled selected financial data in this report and our consolidated financial statements and related notes to this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  as more fully discussed in item a of this report  entitled risk factors 

table of contents overview we are a leader in the research  development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode  or oled  technologies for use in flat panel display  solid state lighting and other applications 
since  we have been exclusively engaged  and expect to continue to be exclusively engaged  in funding and performing research and development activities relating to oled technologies and materials  and in attempting to commercialize these technologies and materials 
we derive our revenue from the following intellectual property and technology licensing  sales of oled materials for evaluation  development and commercial manufacturing  and technology development and support  including government contract work and support provided to third parties for commercialization of their oled products 
while we have made significant progress over the past few years developing and commercializing our family of oled technologies pholed  toled  foled  etc 
and materials  we have incurred significant losses since our inception  resulting in an accumulated deficit of million as of december  we anticipate fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results of operations due to uncertainty regarding  among other factors the timing  cost  and volume of sales of our oled materials  the timing of our receipt of license fees and royalties  as well as fees for future technology development and evaluation  the timing and magnitude of expenditures we may incur in connection with our ongoing research and development and patent related activities  and the timing and financial consequences of our formation of new business relationships and alliances 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and other financial information 
actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under other assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition and deferred revenue  the valuation of certain investments  the valuation and recoverability of acquired technology  stock based compensation  income taxes and our supplemental executive retirement plan  as described below  are our critical accounting policies as contemplated by the sec 
these policies  which have been reviewed with our audit committee  are discussed in greater detail below 
revenue recognition and deferred revenue technology development and support revenue is revenue earned from government contracts  development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees  which includes reimbursements by the us government for all or a portion of the research and development expenses we incur related to our government contracts 
revenue is recognized proportionally as research and development expenses are incurred or as defined milestones are achieved 
in order to ascertain the revenue associated with these contracts for a period  we estimate the proportion of related research and development expenses incurred and whether defined milestones have been achieved 
different estimates would result in different revenues for the period 
we receive non refundable cash payments under certain commercial  development and technology evaluation agreements with our customers 
these payments are generally recognized as revenue over the term of the agreement 
on occasion  however  certain of the payments under development and evaluation agreements are creditable against license fees and or royalties payable by the customer if a commercial license agreement is subsequently executed with the customer 
these payments are classified as deferred revenues  and are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet until such time as revenue can be recognized 
revenue is deferred until a commercial license agreement is executed or negotiations have ceased and there is no 
table of contents appreciable likelihood of executing a commercial license agreement with the customer 
if a commercial license agreement is executed  payments are recorded as revenue over the term of the agreement or the estimated useful life of the licensed technology  for perpetual licenses  and the revenue is classified based on the terms of the license 
otherwise  payments deferred pending a commercial license are recorded as revenue at the time negotiations with the customer show that there is no appreciable likelihood of executing a commercial license agreement 
if we used different estimates for the useful life of the licensed technology  or formed a different judgment on the likelihood of executing a commercial license agreement  reported revenue during the relevant period would differ 
as of december   million was recorded as deferred revenue  of which million is creditable against future commercial license agreements that have not yet been executed or deemed effective 
for the years ended december  and  respectively  million and million of revenue was recognized relating to cash payments received that were creditable against license fees and or royalties for which we determined there was no appreciable likelihood of executing a license agreement with the customer 
for arrangements with extended payment terms where the fee is not fixed and determinable  revenue is recognized when the payment is due and payable 
short term and long term investments we have invested in convertible promissory notes issued by two private companies  both of which are early stage companies still defining their strategic direction and business models 
the carrying value of our convertible promissory note investment portfolio totaled million as of december  for additional information  see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
our convertible promissory note investments were initially recorded at cost and are classified within both short term and long term investments on the consolidated balance sheet 
these convertible promissory note investments are inherently risky as the notes lack a ready market for resale  and the note issuer s success is dependent on product development  market acceptance  operational efficiency  the ability of the investee companies to raise additional funds in financial markets that can be volatile  and other key business factors 
the companies we have invested in could fail or not be able to raise additional funds when needed 
these events could cause our investments to become impaired 
in addition  financial market volatility could negatively affect our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as mergers and private sales 
we determine the fair value of our convertible promissory note investments portfolio quarterly 
the fair value of our convertible promissory note investments is determined through the consideration of whether the investee is experiencing financial difficulty and overall trends in interest rates 
management performs an evaluation of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on any of its debt in the foreseeable future 
the evaluation requires significant judgment and includes quantitative and qualitative analysis of identified events or circumstances affecting the investee  which may impact the fair value of the investment  such as the investee s revenue and earnings trends relative to pre defined milestones and overall business prospects  the technological feasibility of the investee s products and technologies  the general market conditions in the investee s industry or geographic area  including adverse regulatory or economic changes  factors related to the investee s ability to remain in business  such as the investee s liquidity  debt ratios  and the rate at which the investee is using its cash  and the investee s receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation 
if the fair value of a convertible promissory note investment is below our carrying value  the asset will be written down to its fair value with a resulting charge to net income 
temporary impairments result in a write down of the investment to its fair value with the charge reported in shareholders equity 
there were no impairments of convertible promissory note investments as of december  valuation and recoverability of acquired technology during the year ended december   we acquired a portfolio of patent and patent applications for million including related costs and expenses 
for additional information  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the net book value of all our acquired technology was million as of december  acquired technology assets are subject to amortization 
these assets are currently being amortized on a straight line basis over a period of to years which are their estimated economic lives 
changes in technology or in our intended use of these assets  as well as changes in economic or industry factors or in our business or prospects  may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change 
we periodically review our acquired technology assets to confirm the appropriateness of the lives 
our assessment takes into account actual usage  our anticipated future use of the technology  and assumptions about technology evolution 
if these factors indicate that the useful life is different from the previous assessment  we would amortize the remaining net book values prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful life 
we also regularly review our acquired oled technologies for events or changes in circumstances that might indicate the value of these technologies is impaired 
factors considered that could cause impairment include  among others  significant changes in our anticipated future use of these technologies  expected revenue streams resulting from the technologies  and our overall business strategy as it pertains to these technologies  particularly in light of patents owned by others in the same field of use 
when factors indicate that long lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment  the company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows in measuring whether the long lived asset should be written down to fair value as well as if the remaining useful life is still appropriate 
measurement of the amount of impairment would be based on generally accepted valuation methodologies  as deemed appropriate 
valuation of stock based compensation we recognize in the statement of operations the grant date fair value of equity based compensation issued to employees and directors see notes  and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we also record an expense for equity based compensation grants to non employees  in exchange for goods or services  and stock appreciation rights sars issued to employees  based on the fair value  which is remeasured over the vesting period of such awards 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of sars  options and warrants we have granted for purposes of recording charges to the statement of operations 
in order to calculate the fair value of the sars  options and warrants  assumptions are made for certain components of the model  including expected volatility  expected dividend yield rate and expected life 
expected volatilities utilized in the model are based on the historical volatility of our stock price over a period commensurate with the expected life of the award 
the risk free interest rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
in the case of stock options granted to employees  we estimate the expected term of options granted based on our historical experience with our employees exercise of stock options 
in the case of stock options and warrants granted to non employees  the contractual life is used 
although we use our best estimates when setting these assumptions  changes to the assumptions could cause significant adjustments to the valuation of future grants or the remeasurement of non employee awards 
accounting for income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the us and foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgments and estimates are required in evaluating our tax positions for future realization and determining our provision for income taxes 
our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
income tax expense during the year ended december  was primarily comprised of foreign witholding taxes 
these foreign taxes are primarily related to foreign taxes withheld on royalty and license fees paid to the us operating entity 
sdc has been required to withhold tax upon payment of royalty and license fees to the us operating entity at a rate of 
any potential foreign tax credits to be received by the us operating entity for these amounts on our united states tax returns are currently offset by a full valuation allowance as noted below 
although we generated income before income taxes during the years ended december  and  there was no provision for united states federal or state income taxes  excluding certain estimated alternative minimum taxes due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards which are offset by a full valuation allowance 
at december   we had approximately million of federal and million of state net operating loss carryforwards 
our ability to use these net operating loss carryforwards could be subject to limitation because of certain ownership changes 
see income taxes below for additional information 

table of contents retirement plan we have recorded a significant retirement plan benefit liability that is developed from actuarial valuations 
the determination of our retirement plan benefit liability requires key assumptions regarding discount rates  as well as rates of compensation increases  retirement dates and life expectancies used to determine the present value of future benefit payments 
we determine these assumptions in consultation with  and after input from  our actuaries and considering our experience and expectations for the future 
actual results for a given period will often differ from assumed amounts because of economic and other factors 
the discount rate reflects the estimated rate at which the benefit liabilities could be settled at the end of the year 
the discount rate is determined by selecting a single rate that produces a result equivalent to discounting expected benefit payments from the plan using the citigroup above median pension discount curve curve 
based upon this analysis using the curve  we used a discount rate to measure our retirement plan benefit liability of at december  a change of basis points in the discount rate would increase or decrease the expense on an annual basis by approximately  results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  we had operating income of million for the year ended december   compared to operating income of million for the increase in operating income was due to an increase in revenue of million  offset by an increase in operating expenses of million 
we had net income of million  or per basic and diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to net income of million  or per basic and diluted share  for the increase in net income was primarily due to an increase of operating income of million  and a decrease in loss on stock warrant liability of million  offset by an increase in income tax expense of million 
our revenues were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in our overall revenue was primarily due to additional licensing revenues and oled material sales from the expanded adoption of our technology and materials in the marketplace by display manufacturers  particularly sdc  the successor in interest to samsung mobile display co  ltd 
smd 
material sales increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for material sales relates to the sale of our oled materials for incorporation into our customers commercial oled products or for their oled development and evaluation activities 
the increase in material sales was due to the overall expanded adoption of our technology and materials in the marketplace by display manufacturers  particularly from sdc 
we expect this trend to continue through the next year 
material sales included sales of both phosphorescent emitter and host materials 
phosphorescent emitter sales were of our total material sales in  compared to of our total material sales in host material sales were of our total material sales in  compared to of our total material sales in we believe we can participate in the host material business due to our long experience developing emitter materials  which are used together with host material in the emissive layer of an oled 
however  our customers are not required to purchase our host materials in order to utilize our phosphorescent emitter materials  and in addition the host material business is more competitive than the phosphorescent emitter material sales business 
thus  our long term prospects for host material sales are uncertain 
we cannot accurately predict how long our phosphorescent emitter material sales or host material sales to particular customers will continue  as our customers frequently update and alter their product offerings in response to market demands 
continued sales of our oled materials to these customers will depend on several factors  including pricing  availability  continued technical improvement and competitive product offerings 

table of contents royalty and license fees increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for a substantial portion of the increase was due to royalty and license fee payments received under our patent license agreements with sdc 
in august  we entered into a patent license agreement with sdc which replaced and superseded the then existing patent license agreement with sdc 
this patent license agreement with sdc runs through december  for the year ended december   we received and recognized million in license fees from sdc under the new patent license agreement 
for the year ended december   we received and recognized million in license fees from sdc under the new patent license agreement and million in royalties from sdc under the old patent license agreement 
our current patent license agreement with sdc covers the manufacture and sale of specified oled display products 
under the agreement  sdc has agreed to pay us a fixed license fee  payable in semi annual installments over the agreement term 
these installments  which are due in the second and fourth quarter of each annual period  increase on an annual basis over the term of the license agreement 
the installment amounts replaced the quarterly royalty reporting structure in the prior patent license agreement 
the installment amounts were determined through negotiation based on a number of factors  including  without limitation  estimates of sdc oled business growth as a percentage of published oled market forecasts  the use of red and green phosphorescent materials in sdc oled display products  and appropriate royalty rates relating to sdc practice under the licensed patents 
based upon the extended payment arrangement  such amounts are not considered fixed and determinable for revenue recognition purposes until such time the installments become due and payable 
as a result  license fees under our new agreement with sdc will be recognized as they become due and payable  which is currently scheduled to be in the second and fourth quarter of each year  therefore our quarterly license fees  will fluctuate accordingly  depending on the timing of such payments 
at the same time we entered into the current patent license agreement with sdc  we also entered into a new supplemental material purchase agreement with sdc 
under the current supplemental material purchase agreement  sdc agrees to purchase from us a minimum dollar amount of phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products 
this minimum purchase commitment is subject to sdc requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and our ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement 
the minimum purchase amounts increase on an annual basis over the term of the supplemental agreement 
these amounts were determined through negotiation based on a number of factors  including  without limitation  estimates of sdc oled business growth as a percentage of published oled market forecasts and sdc projected minimum usage of red and green phosphorescent emitter materials over the term of the agreement 
sdc purchased phosphorescent emitter materials from us in excess of the minimum purchase amount for the years ended december  and cost of material sales increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for  based on the aforementioned increase in material sales 
cost of material sales includes the cost of producing materials that have been classified as commercial and shipping costs for such materials  but excludes the cost of certain materials which costs have already been expensed as research and development expense 
commercial materials are materials that have been validated by the company for use in commercial oled products 
depending on the amounts  timing and stage of materials being classified as commercial  we expect the costs of materials sold to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
as a result of these timing issues  and due to increased sales of commercial materials  cost of material sales increased for the year ended december  compared to for the years ended december  and  costs associated with million and million  respectively  of material sales relating to commercial materials were included in cost of material sales 
we incurred research and development expenses of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the increase was mainly due to increased costs of million incurred under our agreement with ppg industries  increased costs of million related to outsourced research and development efforts  and increased costs of million related to sponsored research and development contracts 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the increase was mainly due to increased employee costs related to salaries and expenses for new employees as well as costs associated with retirement benefits for certain executive officers  offset by decreased marketing and advertising expenses 

table of contents patent costs and amortization of acquired technology increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the increase was mainly due to increased amortization costs of million due to the amortization expense associated with technology acquired in july see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
additionally  the increase was due to increased costs associated with our defense of certain ongoing and new challenges to our issued patents  as well as the timing of prosecution and maintenance costs associated with a number of patents and patent applications 
royalty and license expense increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the increase consisted mainly of royalties incurred under an amended license agreement with princeton  usc and michigan  resulting from increased revenues 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
interest income increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for on january   we adopted certain revised provisions of accounting standards codification asc  derivatives and hedging 
these provisions apply to freestanding financial instruments or embedded features that have the characteristics of a derivative and to freestanding financial instruments that are potentially settled in an entity s own common stock 
as a result  certain stock purchase warrants that we issued  but which are no longer outstanding  were considered to be derivatives since they contained down round provisions requiring remeasurement at fair value at the end of each period as they were recorded as liabilities 
the fair value of the stock warrant liability was determined using the black scholes option pricing model using assumptions for certain components of the model  including expected volatility and expected annual dividend yield 
the change in fair value of the stock warrant liability was recorded as a gain or loss on the statement of operations  until all warrants were exercised 
in  all remaining outstanding stock warrants to purchase shares of our common stock were exercised 
the change in fair value of these warrants during prior to the exercise date resulted in a million non cash loss on our statement of operations for the year ended december  we recorded income tax expense of million for the year ended december  and a benefit of  for the year ended december  see income taxes below for additional information 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  we had operating income of million for the year ended december   compared to an operating loss of million for the change to operating income was due to an increase in revenue of million  offset by an increase in operating expenses of million 
we had net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  for the change to net income was primarily due to an increase of operating income of million  a decrease in loss on stock warrant liability of million  an increase in interest income of  and an increase in income tax benefit of  our revenues were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in our overall revenue was primarily due to additional oled material sales and licensing revenues from the expanded adoption of our technology and materials in the marketplace by display manufacturers  particularly sdc 

table of contents material sales increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for material sales relates to the sale of our oled materials for incorporation into our customers commercial oled products or for their oled development and evaluation activities 
material sales included sales of both phosphorescent emitter and host materials 
phosphorescent emitter sales were of our total material sales in  compared to of our total material sales in host material sales were of our total material sales in  compared to of our total material sales in royalty and license fees increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for a substantial portion of the increase was due to royalty and license fee payments received under our patent license agreements with sdc 
for the year ended december   we received and recognized million in license fees from sdc under the new patent license agreement and million in royalties from sdc under the old patent license agreement 
cost of material sales increased to million for the year ended december   compared to  for  based on the aforementioned increase in material sales 
for the years ended december  and  costs associated with million and million  respectively  of material sales relating to commercial materials were included in cost of material sales 
we incurred research and development expenses of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the increase was mainly due to increased employee costs of million due primarily to new employees  increased salaries  costs associated with retirement benefits and incentive stock awards for certain executive officers  increased costs of  due to overall expanded research and development efforts to support the growth of our business  and costs of  resulting from commencement of research and development activities at certain of our foreign subsidiaries  offset by decreased amortization costs of million due to part of our acquired technology being fully amortized as of december  selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the overall increase in these costs was driven in part by increased commercial activities and non cash expenses related to stock compensation and in part by costs incurred to establish new subsidiaries in hong kong  korea and japan 
specifically  we incurred increased costs in the following areas increased employee costs of million  due primarily to increased salaries  costs associated with retirement benefits and incentive stock awards for certain executive officers  costs of  resulting from the incorporation and commencement of operations of certain of our foreign subsidiaries  increased costs of  related to stock compensation for members of our board of directors  increased legal fees of  due in large part to expanded licensing negotiations  increased expense of  due to costs associated with certain prototypes  and increased international consulting fees of  resulting from increased revenues 
patent costs increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the increase was mainly due to increased costs associated with our defense of certain ongoing and new challenges to our issued patents  as well as the timing of prosecution and maintenance costs associated with a number of patents and patent applications 

table of contents royalty and license expense increased to million for the year ended december   compared to  for the increase consisted mainly of royalties incurred under an amended license agreement with princeton  usc and michigan  resulting from increased revenues 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
interest income increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the increase was mainly attributable to interest earned on higher average cash and investment balances as a result of proceeds received from the completion of our public offering in march in  all remaining outstanding stock warrants to purchase shares of our common stock were exercised 
the warrants  which contained a down round provision  were previously recorded as a liability 
the change in fair value of these warrants during the period prior to the exercise date resulted in a million non cash loss on our statement of operations for the year ended december   compared to a million non cash loss for income taxes the provision for income taxes primarily consists of foreign taxes on south korean royalty and license fee income starting in may in addition  during the year ended december   we sold approximately million of our state related income tax net operating losses nols and  of our research and development tax credits under the new jersey technology tax certificate transfer program 
we recorded the amount of the completed sale as an income tax benefit for the year ended december  and received the proceeds of million in january during the year ended december   we sold approximately million of our state related income tax nols and  of our research and development tax credits under the new jersey technology tax certificate transfer program 
we received proceeds of  from our sale of these nols and research and development tax credits  and we recorded these proceeds as an income tax benefit for the year ended december  for the year ended december  the tax expense was million and for the years ended december and the net tax benefit was  and  respectively 
although we generated income before income taxes during the years ended december  and  there was no provision for united states federal or state income taxes  excluding certain estimated alternative minimum taxes due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards which are offset by a full valuation allowance 
at december   we had approximately million of federal and million of state net operating loss carryforwards 
our ability to use these net operating loss carryforwards could be subject to limitation because of certain ownership changes 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
our level of future profitability could cause us to conclude that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will be realizable 
we continue to assess our current and projected taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate on a quarterly basis and provided that we continue to sustain actual profitability and can demonstrate sustained forecasted profitability and or upon the implementation of certain tax planning strategies  we could release all or a portion of our deferred tax valuation allowance to reflect the realizability of our deferred tax assets and would begin to provide for income taxes at a rate equal to our combined federal  state and foreign effective rates  at that time 
currently  a full valuation allowance has been established for significantly all our net deferred tax assets because we incurred substantial consolidated operating losses from inception through  as well as continuing losses in certain jurisdictions  and based on the aforementioned factors  we have assessed that the net deferred tax assets do not meet the criteria for realization as of december  at this time  the amount and timing of any future release of the deferred tax valuation allowance and resulting future effective tax rates cannot be determined  but could be material to both our financial position and results of operations and may occur in the near term if current and expected operating trends continue or we implement certain tax planning strategies 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million  for a total of million 
this compares to cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million  for a total of million  as of december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million was primarily due to cash used in investing activities due to the purchase of intangible assets from fujifilm for a total cost of million 
cash provided by operating activities was million for  compared to million for the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the following 
table of contents the impact of the timing of receipts of accounts receivable of million  and an increase in net income of million  which amount excludes the impact of non cash items  offset by impact of the timing of net inventory purchases of million to meet future customer needs  an increase in other current assets of million  impact of the timing of payment of accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  and a decrease of million in deferred revenue and licensing fees received 
cash used in investing activities was million for  compared to million for the decrease in cash used in investing activities was mainly due to the timing of maturities of investments as well as the timing of purchases of investments as a result of the completion of our public offering described below  offset by million from the purchase of intangible assets 
cash used in financing activities was million for  compared to cash provided of million for the decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to repurchases of common stock of million in  as well as the completion of our march public offering 
the offering resulted in proceeds to us of million  which was net of million in underwriting discounts and commissions and other costs associated with the completion of the offering 
in addition  for the year ended december   we received proceeds of million from the exercise of options  compared to proceeds of million from the exercise of options and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock in in connection with stock based employee compensation and option exercises for the years ended december  and  we made payments of million and million  respectively  in withholding taxes 
working capital was million as of december   compared to million as of december  the reduction in working capital is primarily due to the purchase of intangible assets for million in july of we anticipate  based on our internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our operations including  among others  assumptions regarding our working capital requirements  the progress of our research and development efforts  the availability of sources of funding for our research and development work  and the timing and costs associated with the preparation  filing  prosecution  maintenance  defense and enforcement of our patents and patent applications  that we have sufficient cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to meet our obligations for at least the next months 
we believe that potential additional financing sources for us include long term and short term borrowings  public and private sales of our equity and debt securities and the receipt of cash upon the exercise of outstanding stock options 
it should be noted  however  that additional funding may be required in the future for research  development and commercialization of our oled technologies and materials  to obtain  maintain and enforce patents respecting these technologies and materials  and for working capital and other purposes  the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain 
there can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us when needed  on commercially reasonable terms or at all  particularly in the current economic environment 
contractual obligations as of december   we had the following contractual commitments payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years estimated retirement plan benefit payments research related obligations minimum royalty obligation year total 
table of contents under the amended license agreement  we are obligated to pay princeton minimum royalties of  per year until such time as the agreement is no longer in effect 
the agreement has no scheduled expiration date 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of obligations upon termination of employment of executive officers as a result of a change in control of the company 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements in the nature of guarantee contracts  retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities or similar arrangements serving as credit  liquidity or market risk support to unconsolidated entities for any such assets  or obligations including contingent obligations arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities providing financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to us  or that engage in leasing  hedging or research and development services with us 
recently issued accounting pronouncements recently issued accounting pronouncements are addressed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and hold no derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments that could expose us to significant market risk other than our investments disclosed in fair value measurements in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
we generally invest in investment grade financial instruments to reduce our exposure related to investments 
our primary market risk exposure with regard to such financial instruments is to changes in interest rates  which would impact interest income earned on investments 
however  based upon the conservative nature of our investment portfolio and current experience  we do not believe a decrease in investment yields would have a material negative effect on our interest income 
substantially all our revenue is derived from outside of north america 
all revenue is primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore we bear no significant foreign exchange risk
