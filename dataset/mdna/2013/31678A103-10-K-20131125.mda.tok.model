except as otherwise specified  references to the company  we  us  and our  refer to fifth street finance corp 
all amounts are in thousands  except share and per share amounts  percentages and as otherwise indicated 
overview we are a specialty finance company that lends to and invests in small and mid sized companies  primarily in connection with investments by private equity sponsors 
our investment objective is to maximize our portfolio s total return by generating current income from our debt investments and capital appreciation from our equity investments 
we were formed as a delaware limited partnership fifth street mezzanine partners iii  lp on february  effective as of january   fifth street mezzanine partners iii  lp merged with and into fifth street finance corp 
at the time of the merger  all outstanding partnership interests in fifth street mezzanine partners iii  lp were exchanged for  shares of common stock in fifth street finance corp 
on june   we completed an initial public offering of  shares of our common stock at the offering price of per share 
our stock was listed on the new york stock exchange until november  when we transferred the listing to the nasdaq global select market  where it continues to trade under the symbol fsc 
market conditions the global economy has experienced economic uncertainty in recent years 
economic uncertainty impacts our business in many ways  including changing spreads  structures and purchase multiples as well as the overall supply of investment capital 
see risk factors risks relating to economic conditions 
despite the economic uncertainty  our deal pipeline remains robust  with high quality transactions backed by private equity sponsors in small to mid sized companies 
as always  we remain cautious in selecting new investment opportunities  and will only deploy capital in deals which we believe are consistent with our disciplined philosophy of pursuing superior risk adjusted returns 
we expect to grow the investment portfolio by strategically investing in small and mid sized companies when and where appropriate  as evidenced by our recent investment activities 
although we believe that we currently have sufficient capital available to fund investments  a prolonged period of market disruptions may cause us to reduce the volume of loans we originate and or fund  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in this regard  because our common stock has at times traded at a price below our then current net asset value per share and we are limited in our ability to sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share  we may be limited in our ability to raise equity capital 
critical accounting policies basis of presentation the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions affecting amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
we have identified investment valuation and revenue recognition as our most critical accounting estimates 
we continuously evaluate our estimates  including those related to the matters described below 
these estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
a discussion of our critical accounting policies follows 
investment valuation we are required to report our investments that are not publicly traded or for which current market values are not readily available at fair value 
the fair value is deemed to be the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance  we perform detailed valuations of our debt and equity investments on an individual basis  using bond yield  market and income approaches as appropriate 
in general  we utilize a bond yield method for the majority of our investments  as long as it is appropriate 
if  in our judgment  the bond yield approach is not appropriate  we may use the market approach  income approach  or  in certain cases  an alternative methodology potentially including market quotations  asset liquidation model  expected recovery model or other alternative approaches 
under the bond yield approach  we use bond yield models to determine the present value of the future cash flow streams of our debt investments 
we review various sources of transactional data  including private mergers and acquisitions involving debt investments with similar characteristics  and assess the information in the valuation process 
under the market approach  we estimate the enterprise value of the portfolio companies in which we invest 
there is no one methodology to estimate enterprise value and  in fact  for any one portfolio company  enterprise value is best expressed as a range of fair values from which we derive a single estimate of enterprise value 
to estimate the enterprise value of a portfolio company  we analyze various factors  including the portfolio company s historical and projected financial results 
typically  private companies are valued based on multiples of ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  cash flows  net income or revenues 
we generally require portfolio companies to provide annual audited and quarterly and monthly unaudited financial statements  as well as annual projections for the upcoming fiscal year 
under the income approach  we generally prepare and analyze discounted cash flow models based on our projections of the future free cash flows of the business 
our board of directors undertakes a multi step valuation process each quarter in connection with determining the fair value of our investments the quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by our finance department  preliminary valuations are then reviewed and discussed with principals of the investment adviser  separately  independent valuation firms are engaged by our board of directors to prepare preliminary valuations on a selected basis and submit the reports to us  our finance department compares and contrasts its preliminary valuations to the preliminary valuations of the independent valuation firms  our finance department prepares a valuation report for the audit committee of our board of directors  the audit committee of our board of directors is apprised of the preliminary valuations of the independent valuation firms  the audit committee of our board of directors reviews the preliminary valuations  and our finance department responds and supplements the preliminary valuations to reflect any comments provided by the audit committee  the audit committee of our board of directors makes a recommendation to the board of directors regarding the fair value of the investments in our portfolio  and our board of directors discusses the valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith 
the fair value of all of our investments at september   and september   was determined by our board of directors 
our board of directors has authorized the engagement of independent valuation firms to provide us with valuation assistance 
we will continue to engage independent valuation firms to provide us with assistance regarding our determination of the fair value of selected portfolio securities each quarter  however  our board of directors is ultimately and solely responsible for the valuation of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to our valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process 
we intend to have a portion of the portfolio valued by an independent third party on a quarterly basis  with a substantial portion being valued over the course of each fiscal year 
the percentages of our portfolio  at fair value  valued by independent valuation firms each period during the current and two preceding fiscal years were as follows for the quarter ended december  for the quarter ended march  for the quarter ended june  for the quarter ended september  for the quarter ended december  for the quarter ended march  for the quarter ended june  for the quarter ended september  for the quarter ended december  for the quarter ended march  for the quarter ended june  for the quarter ended september  as of september  and september   approximately and  respectively  of our total assets represented investments in portfolio companies valued at fair value 
revenue recognition interest and dividend income interest income  adjusted for accretion of original issue discount  or oid  is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected 
we stop accruing interest on investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible 
distributions from portfolio companies are recorded as dividend income when the distribution is received 
fee income we receive a variety of fees in the ordinary course of business including servicing  advisory  structuring and prepayment fees  which are classified as fee income and recognized as they are earned 
we have also structured exit fees across certain of our portfolio investments to be received upon the future exit of those investments 
exit fees are payable upon the exit of a debt security 
these fees are to be paid to us upon the sooner to occur of i a sale of the borrower or substantially all of the assets of the borrower  ii the maturity date of the loan or iii the date when full prepayment of the loan occurs 
the receipt of such fees is contingent upon the occurrence of one of the events listed above for each of the investments 
a percentage of these fees is included in net investment income over the life of the loan 
as of september   we had structured million in aggregate exit fees across six portfolio investments upon the future exit of those investments 
payment in kind pik interest our loans typically contain contractual pik interest provisions 
the pik interest  which represents contractually deferred interest added to the loan balance that is generally due at the end of the loan term  is generally recorded on the accrual basis to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected 
we generally cease accruing pik interest if there is insufficient value to support the accrual or if we do not expect the portfolio company to be able to pay all principal and interest due 
our decision to cease accruing pik interest involves subjective judgments and determinations based on available information about a particular portfolio company  including whether the portfolio company is current with respect to its payment of principal and interest on its loans and debt securities  monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for the portfolio company  our assessment of the portfolio company s business development success  including product development  profitability and the portfolio company s overall adherence to its business plan  information obtained by us in connection with periodic formal update interviews with the portfolio company s management and  if appropriate  the private equity sponsor  and information about the general economic and market conditions in which the portfolio company operates 
based on this and other information  we determine whether to cease accruing pik interest on a loan or debt security 
our determination to cease accruing pik interest on a loan or debt security is generally made well before our full write down of such loan or debt security 
in addition  if it is subsequently determined that we will not be able to collect any previously accrued pik interest  the fair value of our loans or debt securities would decline by the amount of such previously accrued  but uncollectible  pik interest 
for a discussion of risks we are subject to as a result of our use of pik interest in connection with our investments  see risk factors risks relating to our business and structure we may have difficulty paying our required distributions if we recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income  we may in the future choose to pay dividends in our own stock  in which case you may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash you receive and our incentive fee may induce our investment adviser to make speculative investments 
in addition  if it is subsequently determined that we will not be able to collect any previously accrued pik interest  the fair value of our loans or debt securities would decline by the amount of such previously accrued  but uncollectible  pik interest 
the accrual of pik interest on our debt investments increases the recorded cost basis of these investments in our consolidated financial statements and  as a result  increases the cost basis of these investments for purposes of computing the capital gains incentive fee payable by us to our investment adviser 
to maintain our status as a ric  pik income must be paid out to our stockholders in the form of dividends even though we have not yet collected the cash and may never collect the cash relating to the pik interest 
accumulated pik interest was million and represented of the fair value of our portfolio of investments as of september  and million or as of september  the net increases in loan balances as a result of contractual pik arrangements are separately identified in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
portfolio composition our investments principally consist of loans  purchased equity investments and equity grants in privately held companies 
our loans are typically secured by a first  second or subordinated lien on the assets of the portfolio company and generally have terms of up to six years but an expected average life of between three and four years 
we are currently focusing our origination efforts on a prudent mix of senior secured and subordinated loans which we believe will provide superior risk adjusted returns while maintaining adequate credit protection 
the mix may change over time based on market conditions and management s view of where the best risk adjusted returns are available 
a summary of the composition of our investment portfolio at cost and fair value as a percentage of total investments is shown in the following tables september  september  cost senior secured debt subordinated debt purchased equity collateralized loan obligation clo debt equity grants limited partnership interests total september  september  fair value senior secured debt subordinated debt purchased equity clo debt equity grants limited partnership interests total the industry composition of our portfolio at cost and fair value as a percentage of total investments was as follows september  september  cost healthcare services diversified support services education services advertising specialized finance internet software services it consulting other services oil gas equipment services healthcare equipment specialty stores human resources employment services pharmaceuticals leisure products other diversified financial services auto parts equipment construction engineering household products asset management custody banks home improvement retail apparel  accessories luxury goods airlines data processing outsources services specialty chemicals food distributors research consulting services industrial machinery air freight logistics security alarm services application software environmental facilities services construction materials multi sector holdings building products thrift mortgage finance leisure facilities electronic equipment instruments integrated telecommunication services restaurants distributors electronic manufacturing services movies entertainment total september  september  fair value healthcare services diversified support services education services advertising specialized finance internet software services it consulting other services oil gas equipment services healthcare equipment specialty stores human resources employment services pharmaceuticals leisure products other diversified financial services construction engineering auto parts equipment asset management custody banks household products home improvement retail apparel  accessories luxury goods airlines data processing outsources services specialty chemicals food distributors industrial machinery research consulting services air freight logistics application software security alarm services environmental facilities services construction materials multi sector holdings building products leisure facilities thrift mortgage finance electronic equipment instruments integrated telecommunication services distributors restaurants electronic manufacturing services movies entertainment total portfolio asset quality we employ a ranking system to assess and monitor the credit risk of our investment portfolio 
we rank all investments on a scale from to the system is intended to reflect the performance of the borrower s business  the collateral coverage of the loan  and other factors considered relevant to making a credit judgment 
we have determined that there should be an individual ranking assigned to each tranche of securities in the same portfolio company where appropriate 
this may arise when the perceived risk of loss on the investment varies significantly between tranches due to their respective seniority in the capital structure 
investment ranking is used for investments that are performing above expectations and or capital gains are expected 
investment ranking is used for investments that are performing substantially within our expectations  and whose risks remain materially consistent with the potential risks at the time of the original or restructured investment 
all new investments are initially ranked investment ranking is used for investments that are performing below our expectations and for which risk has materially increased since the original or restructured investment 
the portfolio company may be out of compliance with debt covenants and may require closer monitoring 
to the extent that the underlying agreement has a pik interest provision  investments with a ranking of are generally those on which we are not accruing pik interest 
investment ranking is used for investments that are performing substantially below our expectations and for which risk has increased substantially since the original or restructured investment 
investments with a ranking of are those for which some loss of principal is expected and are generally those on which we are not accruing cash interest 
the following table shows the distribution of our investments on the to investment ranking scale at fair value as of september  and september  investment ranking september  september  fair value of portfolio leverage ratio fair value of portfolio leverage ratio nm nm total due to operating performance this ratio is not measurable and  as a result  is excluded from the total portfolio calculation 
prior year investment rankings were initially ranked on a to ranking scale and have been conformed to the current to ranking scale 
this did not result in a material change to the prior year rankings 
we may from time to time modify the payment terms of our investments  either in response to current economic conditions and their impact on certain of our portfolio companies or in accordance with tier pricing provisions in certain loan agreements 
as of september   we had modified the payment terms of our investments in portfolio companies 
such modified terms may include increased pik interest provisions and reduced cash interest rates 
these modifications  and any future modifications to our loan agreements  may limit the amount of interest income that we recognize from the modified investments  which may  in turn  limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
loans and debt securities on non accrual status as of september   there were no investments on which we had stopped accruing cash interest  pik interest or oid income 
as of september   we had stopped accruing pik interest on one investment 
as of september   we had stopped accruing cash interest  pik interest and oid on four investments that had not paid all of their scheduled cash interest payments for the period ended september  the percentages of our debt investments at cost and fair value by accrual status for the periods ended september   september  and september  were as follows september  september  september  cost of debt portfolio fair value of debt portfolio cost of debt portfolio fair value of debt portfolio cost of portfolio fair value of debt portfolio accrual pik non accrual cash non accrual total cash non accrual status is inclusive of pik and other noncash income  where applicable

discussion and analysis of results and operations results of operations the principal measure of our financial performance is the net increase decrease in net assets resulting from operations  which includes net investment income loss  net realized gain loss and net unrealized appreciation depreciation 
net investment income is the difference between our income from interest  dividends  fees  and other investment income and total expenses 
net realized gain loss on investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their stated costs 
net unrealized appreciation depreciation is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio 
comparison of years ended september  and september  total investment income total investment income includes interest and dividend income on our investments  fee income and other investment income 
fee income consists principally of loan and arrangement fees  administrative fees  unused fees  amendment fees  advisory fees  structuring fees  exit fees  prepayment fees and waiver fees 
other investment income consists primarily of dividend income received from certain of our equity investments 
total investment income for the years ended september  and september  was million and million  respectively 
for the year ended september   this amount primarily consisted of million of interest income from portfolio investments which included million of pik interest and million of fee income 
for the year ended september   this amount primarily consisted of million of interest income from portfolio investments which included million of pik interest and million of fee income 
the increase in our total investment income for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  was primarily attributable to higher average levels of outstanding debt investments  which was principally due to a net increase of debt investments in our portfolio and fees related to debt payoffs  partially offset by amortization repayments received on our debt investments and a decrease in the weighted average yield of our debt investments from to during the year over year period 
expenses net expenses for the years ended september  and september  were million and million  respectively 
net expenses increased for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  by million 
this was due primarily to increases in base management fee net of waivers  which was attributable to a increase in the fair value of the investment portfolio due to an increase in net investment fundings in the year over year period  incentive fee  which was attributable to a increase in pre incentive fee net investment income for the year over year period  and interest expense  which was attributable to a increase in weighted average debt outstanding for the year over year period 
gain on extinguishment of convertible notes during the year ended september   we did not repurchase any of our unsecured convertible notes convertible notes in the open market 
during the year ended september   we repurchased million in principal amount of our convertible notes in the open market and surrendered them to the trustee for cancellation 
the aggregate purchase price of these convertible notes was million because they were trading at a discount due to what we believe were volatile market conditions 
as such  we recorded a gain in the amount of the difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of these convertible notes  net of the proportionate amount of unamortized debt issuance costs 
the net gain on extinguishment of debt we recorded for the year ended september  was million 
because this net gain was included in the amount that must be distributed to our stockholders in order for us to maintain our ric status and is classified as a component of net investment income in our consolidated statements of operations  such net gain was included in pre incentive fee net investment income for purposes of the payment of the income incentive fee to the investment adviser under our investment advisory agreement 
paying an incentive fee on this type of net gain is permissible under our investment advisory agreement  but because such a fee was not specifically detailed in the investment advisory agreement  we obtained the approval of our board of directors to pay such fees 
this type of net gain  and corresponding income incentive fee  may occur again in the future 
any repurchase of our notes or notes as each is defined below at a discount will be treated in a similar manner 
net investment income as a result of the million increase in total investment income  the million decrease in the gain on extinguishment of debt and the million increase in net expenses  net investment income for the year ended september  reflected a million  or  increase compared to the year ended september  realized gain loss on investments and interest rate swap realized gain loss is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and interest rate swaps and their stated costs 
realized losses may also be recorded in connection with our determination that certain investments are considered worthless securities and or meet the conditions for loss recognition per the applicable tax rules

comparison of years ended september  and september  total investment income total investment income includes interest and dividend income on our investments  fee income and other investment income 
fee income consists principally of loan and arrangement fees  administrative fees  unused fees  amendment fees  advisory fees  structuring fees  exit fees  prepayment fees and waiver fees 
other investment income consists primarily of dividend income received from certain of our equity investments 
total investment income for the years ended september  and september  was million and million  respectively

for the year ended september   this amount primarily consisted of million of interest income from portfolio investments which included million of pik interest and million of fee income 
the increase in our total investment income for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  was primarily attributable to higher average levels of outstanding debt investments  which was principally due to a net increase of eight debt investments in our portfolio and fees related to debt payoffs  partially offset by amortization repayments received on our debt investments and a decrease in the weighted average yield of our debt investments from to during the year over year period 
expenses expenses for the years ended september  and september  were million and million  respectively 
expenses increased for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  by million 
this was due primarily to increases in base management fee  which was attributable to a increase in the fair value of the investment portfolio due to an increase in net investment fundings in the year over year period  incentive fee  which was attributable to a increase in pre incentive fee net investment income for the year over year period  and interest expense  which was attributable to a increase in weighted average debt outstanding for the year over year period 
gain on extinguishment of convertible notes during the years ended september  and september   we repurchased million and million in principal amount  respectively  of our convertible notes in the open market and surrendered them to the trustee for cancellation 
the aggregate purchase price of these convertible notes was million and million in and  respectively  because they were trading at a discount due to what we believe were volatile market conditions 
as such  we recorded a gain in the amount of the difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of these convertible notes  net of the proportionate amount of unamortized debt issuance costs 
the net gain on extinguishment of debt we recorded for the years ended september  and september  was million and million  respectively 
because this net gain was included in the amount that must be distributed to our stockholders in order for us to maintain our ric status and is classified as a component of net investment income in our consolidated statements of operations  such net gain was included in pre incentive fee net investment income for purposes of the payment of the income incentive fee to the investment adviser under our investment advisory agreement 
paying an incentive fee on this type of net gain is permissible under our investment advisory agreement  but because such a fee was not specifically detailed in the investment advisory agreement  we obtained the approval of our board of directors to pay such fees 
this type of net gain  and corresponding income incentive fee  may occur again in the future 
net investment income as a result of the million increase in total investment income and the million increase in the gain on extinguishment of debt  as compared to the million increase in total expenses  net investment income for the year ended september  reflected a million  or  increase compared to the year ended september  realized gain loss on investments and interest rate swap realized gain loss is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and interest rate swaps and their stated costs

financial condition  liquidity and capital resources cash flows we have a number of alternatives available to fund the growth of our investment portfolio and our operations  including  but not limited to  raising equity  increasing debt and funding from operational cash flow 
additionally  we may reduce investment size by syndicating a portion of any given transaction 
we intend to fund our future distribution obligations through operating cash flow or with funds obtained through future equity and debt offerings or credit facilities  as we deem appropriate 
for the year ended september   we experienced a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of million 
during that period  we used million of cash in operating activities  primarily for the funding of billion of investments and net revolvers  partially offset by million of principal and pik payments received and million of net investment income

as of september   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  portfolio investments at fair value of billion  million of interest and fees receivable  million of sba debentures payable  million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities  million of convertible notes payable and unfunded commitments of million 
other sources of liquidity we intend to continue to generate cash primarily from cash flows from operations  including interest earned  future borrowings and future offerings of securities 
we maintain a universal shelf registration statement that allows for the public offering and sale of our common stock  debt securities and warrants to purchase such securities 
we may from time to time issue securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement or otherwise pursuant to private offerings 
the issuance of debt or equity securities will depend on future market conditions  funding needs and other factors and there can be no assurance that any such issuance will occur or be successful 
in the future  we may also securitize a portion of our investments in first and second lien senior loans or unsecured debt or other assets 
to securitize loans  we would likely create a wholly owned subsidiary and contribute a pool of loans to the subsidiary 
we would then sell interests in the subsidiary on a non recourse basis to purchasers and we would retain all or a portion of the equity in the subsidiary 
our primary use of funds is investments in our targeted asset classes and cash distributions to holders of our common stock 
although we expect to fund the growth of our investment portfolio through the net proceeds from future equity offerings  including our dividend reinvestment plan  and issuances of senior securities or future borrowings to the extent permitted by the act  our plans to raise capital may not be successful 
in this regard  because our common stock has at times traded at a price below our then current net asset value per share and we are limited in our ability to sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share  we may be limited in our ability to raise equity capital 
in addition  we intend to distribute between and of our taxable income to our stockholders in order to satisfy the requirements applicable to rics under subchapter m of the code 
see regulated investment company status and distributions below 
consequently  we may not have the funds or the ability to fund new investments  to make additional investments in our portfolio companies  to fund our unfunded commitments to portfolio companies or to repay borrowings 
in addition  the illiquidity of our portfolio investments may make it difficult for us to sell these investments when desired and  if we are required to sell these investments  we may realize significantly less than their recorded value 
also  as a business development company  we generally are required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets  less liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities  to total senior securities  which include all of our borrowings and any outstanding preferred stock  of at least 
this requirement limits the amount that we may borrow 
as of september   we were in compliance with this requirement 
the amount of leverage that we employ will depend on our assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing  such as the maturity  covenant package and rate structure of the proposed borrowings  our ability to raise funds through the issuance of shares of our common stock and the risks of such borrowings within the context of our investment outlook 
ultimately  we only intend to use leverage if the expected returns from borrowing to make investments will exceed the cost of such borrowing 
to fund growth in our investment portfolio in the future  we anticipate needing to raise additional capital from various sources  including the equity markets and the securitization or other debt related markets  which may or may not be available on favorable terms  if at all

sbics are designated to stimulate the flow of private equity capital to eligible small businesses 
under sba regulations  sbics may make loans to eligible small businesses and invest in the equity securities of small businesses 
the sbic licenses allow our sbic subsidiaries to obtain leverage by issuing sba guaranteed debentures  subject to the issuance of a capital commitment by the sba and other customary procedures 
sba guaranteed debentures are non recourse  interest only debentures with interest payable semi annually and have a ten year maturity 
the principal amount of sba guaranteed debentures is not required to be paid prior to maturity but may be prepaid at any time without penalty 
the interest rate of sba guaranteed debentures is fixed at the time of issuance at a market driven spread over us treasury notes with year maturities 
sba regulations currently limit the amount that an sbic subsidiary may borrow to a maximum of million when it has at least million in regulatory capital 
affiliated sbics are permitted to issue up to a combined maximum amount of million when they have at least million in regulatory capital

as a result  the million of sba guaranteed debentures held by our sbic subsidiaries carry a weighted average interest rate of as of september  for the years ended september  and  we recorded interest expense of million and million  respectively  related to the sba guaranteed debentures of both subsidiaries 
we have received exemptive relief from the sec to permit us to exclude the debt of our sbic subsidiaries guaranteed by the sba from the definition of senior securities in the asset coverage test under the act 
this allows us increased flexibility under the asset coverage test by permitting us to borrow up to million more than we would otherwise be able to absent the receipt of this exemptive relief

as long as we qualify as a ric  we will not be taxed on our investment company taxable income or realized net capital gains  to the extent that such taxable income or gains are distributed  or deemed to be distributed  to stockholders on a timely basis 
taxable income generally differs from net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses  and generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation until realized 
dividends declared and paid by us in a year may differ from taxable income for that year as such dividends may include the distribution of current year taxable income or the distribution of prior year taxable income carried forward into and distributed in the current year 
distributions also may include returns of capital 
to maintain ric tax treatment  we must  among other things  distribute  with respect to each taxable year  at least of our investment company net taxable income ie  our net ordinary income and our realized net short term capital gains in excess of realized net long term capital losses  if any 
as a ric  we are also subject to a federal excise tax  based on distribution requirements of our taxable income on a calendar year basis eg  calendar year 
we anticipate timely distribution of our taxable income in accordance with tax rules  however  we incurred a de minimis us federal excise tax for calendar year we did not incur a federal excise tax for calendar years and and do not expect to incur a federal excise tax for the calendar year we may incur a federal excise tax in future years 
we intend to distribute to our stockholders between and of our annual taxable income which includes our taxable interest and fee income 
however  we are partially dependent on our sbic subsidiaries for cash distributions to enable us to meet the ric distribution requirements 
our sbic subsidiaries may be limited by the small business investment act of  and sba regulations governing sbics  from making certain distributions to us that may be necessary to enable us to maintain our status as a ric 
we may have to request a waiver of the sba s restrictions for our sbic subsidiaries to make certain distributions to maintain our ric status 
we cannot assure you that the sba will grant such waiver 
also  the covenants under the wells fargo facility and sumitomo facility could  under certain circumstances  restrict funding and funding ii from making distributions to us and  as a result  hinder our ability to satisfy the distribution requirement 
similarly  the covenants contained in the ing facility may prohibit us from making distributions to our stockholders  and  as a result  could hinder our ability to satisfy the distribution requirement 
in addition  we may retain for investment some or all of our net taxable capital gains ie  realized net long term capital gains in excess of realized net short term capital losses and treat such amounts as deemed distributions to our stockholders 
if we do this  our stockholders will be treated as if they received actual distributions of the capital gains we retained and then reinvested the net after tax proceeds in our common stock 
our stockholders also may be eligible to claim tax credits or  in certain circumstances  tax refunds equal to their allocable share of the tax we paid on the capital gains deemed distributed to them 
to the extent our taxable earnings for a fiscal taxable year fall below the total amount of our dividend distributions for that fiscal year  a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders 
we may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time 
in addition  we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings applicable to us as a business development company under the act and due to provisions in our credit facilities and debt instruments 
if we do not distribute a certain percentage of our taxable income annually  we will suffer adverse tax consequences  including possible loss of our status as a ric 
we cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level 
in accordance with certain applicable treasury regulations and private letter rulings issued by the internal revenue service  a ric may treat a distribution of its own stock as fulfilling its ric distribution requirements if each stockholder may elect to receive his or her entire distribution in either cash or stock of the ric  subject to a limitation that the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders must be at least of the aggregate declared distribution 
if too many stockholders elect to receive cash  each stockholder electing to receive cash must receive a pro rata amount of cash with the balance of the distribution paid in stock 
in no event will any stockholder  electing to receive cash  receive less than of his or her entire distribution in cash 
if these and certain other requirements are met  for u 
s federal income tax purposes  the amount of the dividend paid in stock will be equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of stock 
we have no current intention of paying dividends in shares of our stock in accordance with these treasury regulations or private letter rulings

on october   we amended the terms of the sumitomo facility  to  among other things reduce the size of the facility from million to million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates may affect both our cost of funding and our interest income from portfolio investments  cash and cash equivalents and idle funds investments 
our risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze our risk  to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks and limits by means of reliable administrative and information systems and other policies and programs 
our investment income will be affected by changes in various interest rates  including libor and prime rates  to the extent our debt investments include floating interest rates 
in addition  our investments are carried at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors in accordance with the act see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies investment valuation 
our valuation methodology utilizes discount rates in part in valuing our investments  and changes in those discount rates may have an impact on the valuation of our investments 
as of september   of our debt investment portfolio at fair value and of our debt investment portfolio at cost bore interest at floating rates 
the composition of our floating rate debt investments by cash interest rate floor excluding pik as of september  and september  was as follows september  september  fair value of floating rate portfolio fair value of floating rate portfolio under to under to under and over total based on our consolidated statement of assets and liabilities as of september   the following table shows the approximate annualized increase decrease in components of net assets resulting from operations of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates  assuming no changes in our investment and capital structure basis point increase interest income interest expense net increase decrease a decline in interest rates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we regularly measure exposure to interest rate risk 
we assess interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities 
based on this review  we determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates
