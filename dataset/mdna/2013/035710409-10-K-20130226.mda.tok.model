overview we own  manage  and finance a portfolio of real estate related investments  including mortgage pass through certificates  collateralized mortgage obligations or cmos  agency callable debentures  and other securities representing interests in or obligations backed by pools of mortgage loans 
our principal business objective is to generate net income for distribution to our stockholders from the spread between the interest income on our investment securities and the costs of borrowing to finance our acquisition of investment securities and from dividends we receive from our subsidiaries 
our wholly owned subsidiaries offer diversified real estate  asset management and other financial services 
to date over of our total assets have consisted of agency mortgage backed securities 
while we remain committed to the agency market  given the current environment  we believe it is prudent to diversify a portion of our investment portfolio 
therefore  we may allocate up to of our stockholders equity to real estate assets other than agency mortgage backed securities 
we are a maryland corporation that commenced operations on february  we are self advised and self managed 
we acquired fixed income discount advisory company or fidac on june  and merganser capital management  inc or merganser on october  fidac and merganser manage a number of investment vehicles and separate accounts for which they earn fee income 
our subsidiary  rcap securities  inc or rcap  operates as a broker dealer  and was granted membership in the financial industry regulatory authority or finra in january in  we established shannon funding llc or shannon  which provides warehouse financing to residential mortgage originators in the united states 
in  we also established charlesfort capital management llc or charlesfort  which engages in corporate middle market lending transactions 
we also own an additional subsidiary which owns trading securities 
we have elected and believe that we are organized and have operated in a manner that qualifies us to be taxed as a real estate investment trust or reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended or the code 
if we qualify for taxation as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income that is distributed to our stockholders 
therefore  substantially all of our assets  other than fidac  merganser and rcap  which are our taxable reit subsidiaries  consist of qualified reit real estate assets of the type described in section c b of the code 
we have financed our purchases of agency mortgage backed securities and agency debentures with the net proceeds of equity offerings  convertible notes offerings and borrowings under repurchase agreements whose interest rates adjust based on changes in short term market interest rates 
capital investment policy under our capital investment policy  at least of our total assets must be comprised of high quality mortgage backed securities and short term investments 
high quality securities means securities that are rated within one of the two highest rating categories by at least one of the nationally recognized rating agencies  are unrated but are guaranteed by the united states government or an agency of the united states government  or are unrated but we determine them to be of comparable quality to high quality rated mortgage backed securities 
the remainder of our assets  comprising not more than of our total assets  may consist of other qualified reit real estate assets which are unrated or rated less than high quality  but which are at least investment grade rated bbb or better by standard poor s corporation or s p or the equivalent by another nationally recognized rating agency or  if not rated  we determine them to be of comparable credit quality to an investment which is rated bbb or better 
in addition  we may directly or indirectly invest part of this remaining of our assets in other types of securities  including without limitation  unrated debt  equity or derivative securities  to the extent consistent with our reit qualification requirements 
the derivative securities in which we invest may include securities representing the right to receive interest only or a disproportionately large amount of interest  as well as inverse floaters  which may have imbedded leverage as part of their structural characteristics 
we may acquire agency mortgage backed securities backed by single family residential mortgage loans as well as securities backed by loans on multi family  commercial or other real estate related properties 
to date over of our total assets have consisted of agency mortgage backed securities and debentures 
while we remain committed to the agency market  given the current environment  we believe it is prudent to diversify a portion of our investment portfolio 
therefore  we may allocate up to of our stockholders equity to real estate assets other than agency mortgage backed securities 
the results of our operations are affected by various factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our results of operations primarily depend on  among other things  our net interest income  the market value of our assets and the supply of and demand for such assets 
our net interest income  which reflects the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of discounts  varies primarily as a result of changes in interest rates  borrowing costs and prepayment speeds  the behavior of which involves various risks and uncertainties 
prepayment speeds  as reflected by the constant prepayment rate  or cpr  and interest rates vary according to the type of investment  conditions in financial markets  competition and other factors  none of which can be predicted with any certainty 
in general  as prepayment speeds on our agency mortgage backed securities portfolio increase  related purchase premium amortization increases  thereby reducing the net yield on such assets 
the cpr on our agency mortgage backed securities portfolio averaged and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
since changes in interest rates may significantly affect our activities  our operating results depend  in large part  upon our ability to effectively manage interest rate risks and prepayment risks while maintaining our status as a reit 
we continue to explore alternative business strategies  alternative investments and other strategic initiatives to complement our core business strategy of investing  on a leveraged basis  in high quality investment securities 
no assurance  however  can be provided that any such strategic initiative will or will not be implemented in the future 
the table below provides quarterly and annual information regarding our average interest earning assets  interest income  yield on average interest earning assets  average interest bearing liabilities  economic interest expense  average cost of interest bearing liabilities  economic net interest income  and net interest rate spreads for the periods presented 
average interest earning assets total interest income yield on average interest earning assets average interest bearing liabilities economic interest expense average cost of interest bearing liabilities economic net interest income net interest rate spread ratios for the quarters have been annualized  dollars in thousands year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  quarter ended december  quarter ended september  quarter ended june  quarter ended march  does not reflect unrealized gains losses or premium discount 
economic interest expense includes interest expense on interest rate swaps 
economic net interest income includes interest expense on interest rate swaps our net interest rate spread has declined each quarter in the declining net interest rate spread is primarily attributable to the continuing low interest rate environment and marginally higher cpr which  as discussed above  reduces the net yield on our agency mortgage backed securities portfolio 
the following table presents the cpr experienced on our agency mortgage backed securities portfolio  on an annualized basis  for the quarterly periods presented 
quarter ended cpr december  september  june  march  gaap and non gaap reconciliation this management discussion and analysis section contains analysis and discussion of non gaap measurements reflected in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the non gaap measurements are non gaap total stockholders equity  economic interest expense and economic net interest income 
for the purpose of calculating average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  daily balances are used 
for the purposes of computing ratios relating to equity measures throughout this report  equity includes series b preferred stock  which has been treated under gaap as temporary equity 
for the purpose of computing net interest income and ratios relating to cost of funds measures throughout this report  interest expense includes interest expense on interest rate swaps  which is classified in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income as realized gains losses on interest rate swaps 
interest rate swaps are used to hedge the increase in interest expense on repurchase agreements in a rising rate environment 
presenting the contractual interest payments on interest rate swaps with the interest expense on interest bearing liabilities reflects total contractual interest payments 
this presentation depicts the economic value of our investment strategy 
interest expense  including interest expense on interest rate swaps  is referred to as economic interest expense 
net interest income  including interest expense on interest rate swaps  is referred to as economic net interest income 
the following table compares the gaap and non gaap measurements reflected in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the non gaap measurements are non gaap total stockholders equity  economic interest expense and economic net interest income 
gaap total stockholders equity non gaap total stockholders equity gaap interest expense economic interest expense gaap net interest income economic net interest income dollars in thousands for the year ended december  for the year ended december  for the year ended december  for the year ended december  for the year ended december  for the quarter ended december  for the quarter ended september  for the quarter ended june  for the quarter ended march  we believe that the non gaap total stockholders equity  economic interest expense and economic net interest income provides meaningful information to consider  in addition to the respective amounts prepared in accordance with gaap 
the non gaap measures help us to evaluate our financial position and performance without the effects of certain transactions and gaap adjustments that are not necessarily indicative of our current investment portfolio  operations  capitalization  or stockholders equity 
our presentation of the economic value of our investment strategy has important limitations 
other market participants may calculate total stockholders equity  economic interest expense and economic net interest income differently than we calculate them 
although we believe that the calculation of the economic value of our investment strategy described above helps our financial position and performance without the effects of certain transactions  it is of limited usefulness as an analytical tool 
therefore  the economic value of our investment strategy should not be viewed in isolation and is not a substitute for total stockholders equity  economic interest expense and economic net interest income computed in accordance with gaap 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap  which require us to make estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity valuation of financial instruments agency mortgage backed securities and debentures there is an active market for agency mortgage backed securities and debentures 
since we primarily invest in securities that can be measured from actively quoted prices  there is a high degree of observable inputs and less subjectivity measuring fair value 
internal market values are determined using quoted prices from the tba market  the treasury curve  and the underlying characteristics of the individual securities  which may include coupon  periodic and life caps  reset dates  and the expected life of the security 
all internal market values are compared to external sources or dealer quotes to determine reasonableness 
additionally  securities used as collateral for repurchase agreements are priced daily by counterparties to ensure sufficient collateralization  providing additional verification of our internal pricing 
interest rate swaps we use the overnight indexed swap ois curve as an input to value substantially all of our interest rate swaps 
we believe using the ois curve  which reflects the interest rate typically paid on cash collateral  more accurately reflects the fair value of interest rate swaps 
consistent with market practice  we have individually negotiated agreements with certain counterparties to exchange collateral margining based on the level of fair values of the interest rate swaps 
through this margining process  one party or each party to a derivative contract provides the other party with information about the fair value of the derivative contract to calculate the amount of collateral required  providing additional verification of our recorded fair value of the interest rate swaps 
revenue recognition interest income on agency mortgage backed securities and debentures is recognized over the projected life of the securities using the interest method 
the projected life of the securities is determined based on expected prepayment speeds  past prepayment history of the security  government initiatives that would affect the agency mortgage backed securities market  and market consensus 
gains or losses on investment securities are recorded on trade date based on the average cost of the security 
income taxes we elected to be taxed as a reit  under sections through of the internal revenue code  beginning with our taxable year ended december  to qualify as a reit  we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement to distribute at least of our ordinary taxable income  if any  to stockholders 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to us federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will then be subject to us federal income taxes on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and we will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a reit for us federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost unless the internal revenue service grants us relief under certain statutory provisions 
such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distributions to stockholders 
however  we believe that we will be organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a reit and we intend to operate in the foreseeable future in such a manner so that we will qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes 
we may  however  be subject to certain state and local taxes and our taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to federal  state and local taxes 
exposure to european financial counterparties a significant portion of our agency mortgage backed securities are financed with repurchase agreements 
we secure our borrowings under these agreements by pledging our agency mortgage backed securities as collateral to the lender 
the collateral we pledge exceeds the amount of the borrowings under each agreement  typically with the extent of over collateralization being at least of the amount borrowed 
if the counterparty to the repurchase agreement defaults on its obligations and we are not able to recover our pledged assets  we are at risk of losing the over collateralized amount 
the amount of this exposure is the difference between the amount loaned to us plus interest due to the counterparty and the fair value of the collateral pledged by us to the lender including accrued interest receivable on such collateral 
we also use interest rate swaps to manage our interest rate risks 
under these swap agreements  we pledge agency mortgage backed securities as collateral as part of a margin arrangement for interest rate swaps that are in an unrealized loss position 
if a counterparty were to default on its obligation  we would be exposed to a loss to a swap counterparty to the extent that the amount of our agency mortgage backed securities pledged exceeded the unrealized loss on the associated swaps and we were not able to recover the excess collateral 
over the past several years  several large european financial institutions have experienced financial difficulty and have been either rescued by government assistance or by other large european banks or institutions 
some of these financial institutions or their us subsidiaries have provided us financing under repurchase agreements or we have entered into interest rate swaps with such institutions 
we have entered into repurchase agreements and or interest rate swaps with financial institution counterparties that are either domiciled in europe or a us based subsidiary of a european domiciled financial institution 
the following table summarizes our exposure to such counterparties at december  country number of counterparties repurchase agreement financing interest rate swaps at fair value exposure exposure as a percentage of total assets dollars in thousands france germany netherlands scotland switzerland england total represents the amount of cash and or securities pledged as collateral to each counterparty less the aggregate of repurchase agreement financing and unrealized loss on swaps for each counterparty 
at december   we did not use credit default swaps or other forms of credit protection to hedge the exposures summarized in the table above 
if the european credit crisis continues to impact these major european financial institutions  it is possible that it will also impact the operations of their us subsidiaries 
our financings and operations could be adversely affected by such events 
we monitor our exposure to our repurchase agreement and swap counterparties on a regular basis  using various methods  including review of recent rating agency actions  financial relief plans  credit spreads or other developments and by monitoring the amount of cash and securities collateral pledged and the associated loan amount under repurchase agreements and or the fair value of swaps with our counterparties 
we make reverse margin calls on our counterparties to recover excess collateral as permitted by the agreements governing our financing arrangements or interest rate swaps  or may try to take other actions to reduce the amount of our exposure to a counterparty when necessary 
results of operations net income summary for the year ended december  our net income was billion or per average common share  as compared to net income of million or per average common share for the year ended december  and net income of billion or per average common share for the year ended december  net income per average share increased by per average common share and the total net income increased billion for the year ended december   when compared to the year ended december  we attribute the majority of the increase in net income for the year ended december  from the year ended december  to the unrealized losses on interest rate swaps of million for the year ended december   as compared to an unrealized loss on interest rate swaps of billion for the year ended december  net income per average share decreased by per average share available to common shareholders and total net income decreased million for the year ended december   when compared to the year ended december  we attribute the decrease in total net income for the year ended december  from the year ended december  to the unrealized losses on interest rate swaps of billion for the year ended december   compared to an unrealized loss on interest rate swaps of million for the year ended december  net income summary dollars in thousands  except for per share data for the years ended december  interest income investments us treasury securities securities loaned total interest income interest expense repurchase agreements convertible senior notes us treasury securities sold  not yet purchased securities borrowed total interest expense net interest income other income loss investment advisory and other fee income net gains losses on disposal of investments net loss on extinguishment of convertible senior notes dividend income from affiliates net gains losses on trading assets net unrealized gain losses on agency interest only mortgage backed securities income from underwriting subtotal realized gains losses on interest rate swaps realized gains losses on termination of interest rate swaps unrealized gains losses on interest rate swaps subtotal total other income loss expenses distribution fees compensation expense other general and administrative expenses total expenses income loss before income taxes and income from equity method investment in affiliate income taxes income loss from equity method investment in affiliate net income loss dividends on preferred stock net income loss available related to common shareholders net income loss per share available related to common shareholders basic diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding basic diluted average total assets average equity return on average total assets return on average equity interest expense related to the company s interest rate swaps is recorded in realized gains losses on interest rate swaps on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income interest income and average earning asset yield our interest income for the years ended december    and was billion  billion and billion  respectively

we do not manage our portfolio to have a pre designated amount of borrowings at quarter or year end 
our borrowings at period end are a snapshot of borrowings as of a date  and this number should be expected to differ from average borrowings over the period for a number of reasons 
the mortgage backed securities we own pay principal and interest towards the end of each month and the mortgage backed securities we purchase are typically settled during the beginning of the month 
as a result  depending on the amount of mortgage backed securities we have committed to purchase  we may retain the principal and interest we receive in the prior month  or we may use it to pay down our borrowings 
moreover  we use interest rate swaps to hedge our portfolio and as we pledge or receive collateral under these agreements  our borrowings on any given day may be increased or decreased 
our average borrowings during a quarter will differ from period end borrowings as we implement our portfolio management strategies and risk management strategies over changing market conditions by increasing or decreasing leverage 
additionally  these numbers will differ during periods when we conduct capital raises  as in certain instances we may purchase additional assets and increase leverage with the expectation of a successful capital raise 
since our average borrowings and period end borrowings can be expected to differ  we believe our average borrowings during a period provides a more accurate representation of our exposure to the risks associated with leverage 
economic net interest income our economic net interest income  including interest expense on interest rate swaps  totaled billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
even though our average interest earning assets increased from during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   by billion  economic net interest income declined 
the decline was due to reduced economic interest rate spread 
our economic net interest rate spread for the year ended december  was or less than the interest rate spread for the year ended december  of 
our economic net interest income increased by million for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  because of the increase in average interest earnings assets  as a result of raising billion in additional capital in our economic net interest rate spread for the year ended december  was  or basis point more than the interest rate spread for the year ended december  of

we attribute the decrease in total net income for the year ended december  from the year ended december  primarily due the unrealized loss on interest rate swaps of billion  as compared to the unrealized loss on interest rate swaps of million for the year ended december  the table below shows the components of our return on average equity for the periods presented

financial condition investment securities substantially all of our agency mortgage backed securities at december    and were mortgage backed securities backed by single family mortgage loans 
substantially all of the mortgage assets underlying our agency mortgage backed securities were secured with a first lien position on the underlying single family properties 
substantially all of our mortgage backed securities were freddie mac  fannie mae or ginnie mae pass through certificates or cmos  which carry an actual or implied aaa rating 
we carry all of our agency mortgage backed securities at fair value 
we accrete discount balances as an increase in interest income over the expected life of the related interest earning assets and we amortize premium balances as a decrease in interest income over the expected life of on the related interest earning assets 
at december    and we had on our balance sheet a total of million  million and million  respectively  of unamortized discount which is the difference between the remaining principal value and current historical amortized cost of our investment securities acquired at a price below principal value and a total of billion  billion and billion  respectively  of unamortized premium which is the difference between the remaining principal value and the current historical amortized cost of our investment securities acquired at a price above principal value 
we received mortgage principal repayments of billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the average prepayment speed for the year ended december   and was   and  respectively 
given our current portfolio composition  if mortgage principal prepayment rates were to increase over the life of our mortgage backed securities  all other factors being equal  our net interest income would decrease during the life of these mortgage backed securities as we would be required to amortize our net premium balance into income over a shorter time period 
similarly  if mortgage principal prepayment rates were to decrease over the life of our mortgage backed securities  all other factors being equal  our net interest income would increase during the life of these mortgage backed securities as we would amortize our net premium balance over a longer time period

borrowings as of december  and  and  respectively  of our debt consisted of borrowings collateralized by a pledge of our investment securities 
these borrowings appear on our consolidated statement of financial condition as repurchase agreements 
all of our agency mortgage backed securities and debentures are currently accepted as collateral for these borrowings 
however  we limit our borrowings  and thus our potential asset growth  in order to maintain unused borrowing capacity and thus increase the liquidity and strength of our balance sheet 
for the year ended december   the term to maturity of our borrowings ranged from one day to years 
additionally  we have entered into borrowings giving the counterparty the right to call the balance prior to maturity 
at december  and december   the weighted average cost of funds for all of our borrowings was and  respectively  including the effect of the interest rate swaps  convertible senior notes due and convertible senior notes due collectively  the convertible senior notes  and the weighted average maturity was days and days  respectively 
the company did not have an amount at risk greater than of the equity of the company with any counterparty as of december  or december  liquidity liquidity  which is our ability to turn non cash assets into cash  allows us to purchase additional interest earning assets and to pledge additional assets to secure existing borrowings should the value of our pledged assets decline 
potential immediate sources of liquidity for us include cash balances and unused borrowing capacity 
our non cash assets are largely actual or implied aaa assets  and accordingly  we have not had  nor do we anticipate having  difficulty in converting our assets to cash 
our balance sheet also generates liquidity on an on going basis through mortgage principal repayments and net earnings held prior to payment as dividends 
should our needs ever exceed these on going sources of liquidity plus the immediate sources of liquidity discussed above  we believe that in most circumstances our interest earning assets could be sold to raise cash 
the maintenance of liquidity is one of the goals of our capital investment policy 
under this policy  we limit asset growth in order to preserve unused borrowing capacity for liquidity management purposes 
we anticipate that  upon repayment of each borrowing under a repurchase agreement  we will use the collateral immediately for borrowing under a new repurchase agreement 
we have not at the present time entered into any commitment agreements under which the lender would be required to enter into new repurchase agreements during a specified period of time  nor do we presently plan to have liquidity facilities with commercial banks 
under our repurchase agreements  we may be required to pledge additional assets to our repurchase agreement counterparties ie  lenders in the event the estimated fair value of the existing pledged collateral under such agreements declines and such lenders demand additional collateral a margin call  which may take the form of additional securities or cash 
similarly  if the estimated fair value of interest earning assets increases due to changes in market interest rates or market factors  lenders may release collateral back to us 
specifically  margin calls result from a decline in the value of our agency mortgage backed securities securing our repurchase agreements  prepayments on the mortgages securing such agency mortgage backed securities 
changes in the fair value or changes in market interest rates and other market factors may result in a margin call 
our repurchase agreements generally provide that the valuations for the agency mortgage backed securities securing our repurchase agreements are to be obtained from a generally recognized source agreed to by the parties 
however  in certain circumstances and under certain of our repurchase agreements our lenders have the sole discretion to determine the value of the agency mortgage backed securities securing our repurchase agreements 
in instances where we have agreed to permit our lenders to make a determination of the value of the agency mortgage backed securities securing our repurchase agreements  such lenders are required to act in good faith in making such valuation determinations and in certain of these instances are also required to act reasonably in this determination 
our repurchase agreements generally provide that in the event of a margin call we must provide additional securities or cash on the same business day that a margin call is made  if the lender provides us notice prior to the margin notice deadline on such day 
through december   we did not have any margin calls on our repurchase agreements that we were not able to satisfy with either cash or additional pledged collateral 
however  should prepayment speeds on the mortgages underlying our agency mortgage backed securities and or market interest rates suddenly increase  margin calls on our repurchase agreements could result  causing an adverse change in our liquidity position 
at december   we had total pledged collateral for repurchase agreements and interest rate swaps of billion 
the weighted average haircut was approximately on repurchase agreements 
the excess capital cushion totaled approximately billion 
the quality and character of the agency mortgage backed securities that we pledge as collateral under the repurchase agreements and interest rate swaps did not materially change in the quarter and year ended december   compared to quarter and year ended december   and our counterparties did not materially alter any requirements  including required haircuts  related to the collateral we pledge under repurchase agreements and interest rate swaps during the quarter and year ended december  the following table summarizes the effect on our liquidity and cash flows from contractual obligations for repurchase agreements  interest expense on repurchase agreements and convertible senior notes  the non cancelable office lease and employment agreements as of december  the table does not include the effect of net interest rate payments under our interest rate swap agreements 
the net swap payments will fluctuate based on monthly changes in the receive rate 
as of december   the interest rate swaps had a net negative fair value of billion

during the years ended december  and  we received billion and billion from principal repayments  and used leverage on our agency mortgage backed securities which provided billion and billion in cash  respectively 
in addition  we may from time to time sell securities as a source of cash to fund new purchases

llc and rcap securities  inc together  the agents 
pursuant to the terms of the distribution agency agreements  we may sell from time to time through the agents  as our sales agents  up to  shares of our common stock 
we did not make any sales under the distribution agency agreements during the year ended december  on october   we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to billion of our outstanding common shares over a month period 
all common shares purchased were part of a publicly announced plan in open market transactions 
during the year ended december   we repurchased approximately million shares of our outstanding common stock for million  of which million had not settled at december  on january   we entered into an agreement pursuant to which we sold  shares of our common stock for net proceeds following expenses of approximately billion 
this transaction settled on january  on february   we entered into an agreement pursuant to which we sold  shares of our common stock for net proceeds following expenses of approximately billion 
this transaction settled on february  on july   we entered into an agreement pursuant to which we sold  shares of our common stock for net proceeds following expenses of approximately billion 
this transaction settled on july  on june   we amended our charter to increase the number of authorized shares of capital stock  par value per share  from  shares to  shares  consisting of  shares classified as common stock   shares classified as series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock  and  shares classified as series b cumulative convertible preferred stock 
on may   we amended our charter through the filing of articles supplementary to our charter to reclassify  shares of authorized shares of common stock as series c cumulative redeemable preferred stock 
on september   we amended our charter through the filing of articles supplementary to our charter to reclassify  shares of authorized shares of common stock as series d cumulative redeemable preferred stock 
following the effectiveness of the articles supplementary to our charter our authorized shares of capital stock  par value of per share  consists of  shares classified as common stock   shares classified as series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock   shares classified as series b cumulative convertible preferred stock   shares classified as series c cumulative redeemable preferred stock and  shares classified as series d cumulative redeemable preferred stock 
unrealized gains and losses with our available for sale accounting treatment  unrealized fluctuations in market values of assets do not impact our gaap or taxable income but rather are reflected on our balance sheet by changing the carrying value of the asset and stockholders equity under accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
as a result of this mark to market accounting treatment  our book value and book value per share are likely to fluctuate far more than if we used historical amortized cost accounting 
as a result  comparisons with companies that use historical cost accounting for some or all of their balance sheet may not be meaningful 
the table below shows unrealized gains and losses reflected in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
unrealized gains and losses dollars in thousands unrealized gain unrealized loss net unrealized gain loss unrealized changes in the estimated net fair value of available for sale investments may have a direct effect on our potential earnings and dividends positive changes will increase our equity base and allow us to increase our borrowing capacity while negative changes tend to limit borrowing capacity under our capital investment policy 
a very large negative change in the net fair value of our available for sale investments securities might impair our liquidity position  requiring us to sell assets with the likely result of realized losses upon sale 
leverage our debt to equity ratio at december   and was  and  respectively 
we generally expect to maintain a ratio of debt to equity of less than the ratio varies from time to time based upon various factors  including our management s opinion of the level of risk of our assets and liabilities  our liquidity position  our level of unused borrowing capacity  the availability of credit  over collateralization levels required by lenders when we pledge assets to secure borrowings and our assessment of domestic and international market conditions 
our debt to equity ratios have been below our historical average ratios since the credit crisis of we believe that it is prudent to maintain our existing debt to equity ratio because there continues to be volatility in the mortgage and credit markets primarily driven by the uncertainty in europe and us capital markets 
our target debt to equity ratio is determined under our capital investment policy 
should our actual debt to equity ratio increase above the target level due to asset acquisition or market value fluctuations in assets  we would cease to acquire new assets 
our management will  at that time  present a plan to our board of directors to bring us back to our target debt to equity ratio  in many circumstances  this would be accomplished over time by the monthly reduction of the balance of our agency mortgage backed securities through principal repayments 
asset liability management and effect of changes in interest rates we regularly review our asset liability management strategy with respect to interest rate risk  mortgage prepayment risk  credit risk and the related issues of capital adequacy and liquidity 
our goal is to provide attractive risk adjusted stockholder returns while maintaining what we believe is a strong balance sheet 
we seek to manage the extent to which our net income changes as a function of changes in interest rates by matching adjustable rate assets with variable rate borrowings 
in addition  we have attempted to mitigate the potential impact on net income of periodic and lifetime coupon adjustment restrictions in our portfolio of agency mortgage backed securities and agency debentures by entering into interest rate swaps 
at december   we had entered into swap agreements with a total notional amount of billion 
we agreed to pay a weighted average pay rate of and receive a floating rate based on one month libor 
at december   we had entered into swap agreements with a total notional amount of billion 
we agreed to pay a weighted average pay rate of and receive a floating rate based on one month libor 
the weighted average pay rate declined by from december  to december  the decline was the direct result of interest rate swaps maturing or terminated with higher pay rates being replaced with interest rate swaps with lower pay rates 
we believe that for the immediately foreseeable periods  our weighted average pay rate will continue to decline as a result of interest rate swaps with higher pay rates maturing or being terminated and the replacement of such swaps with interest rate swaps with lower pay rates 
we may enter into similar derivative transactions in the future by entering into interest rate collars  caps or floors or purchasing interest only securities 
changes in interest rates may also affect the rate of mortgage principal prepayments and  as a result  prepayments on mortgage backed securities 
we seek to mitigate the effect of changes in the mortgage principal repayment rate by balancing assets we purchase at a premium with assets we purchase at a discount 
to date  the aggregate premium exceeds the aggregate discount on our mortgage backed securities 
as a result  prepayments  which result in the amortization of unamortized premiums  will reduce our net income compared to what net income would be absent such prepayments 
the following table summarizes certain characteristics of our interest rate swaps as of december  maturity of interest rate swaps dollars in thousands maturity current notional weighted average pay rate weighted average receive rate weighted average years to maturity years years years greater than years total weighted average off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
further  we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitment or intent to provide funding to any such entities 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any market  credit  liquidity or financing risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
capital resources at december   we had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
inflation virtually all of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  interest rates and other factors drive our performance far more than does inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and our dividends are based upon our net income as calculated for tax purposes  in each case  our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost or fair market value without considering inflation 
other matters we calculate that at least of our assets were qualified reit assets  as defined in the code for the years ended december  and we also calculate that our revenue qualifies for the source of income test and for the source of income test rules for the years ended december   and and for each quarter therein 
consequently  we met the reit income and asset tests 
we also met all reit requirements regarding the ownership of our common stock and the distribution of our net income 
therefore  for the years ended december   and  we believe that we qualified as a reit under the code 
we at all times intend to conduct our business so as not to become regulated as an investment company under the investment company act of  or the investment company act 
if we were to become regulated as an investment company  then our use of leverage would be substantially reduced 
we currently rely on the exemption from registration provided by section c c of the investment company act 
section c c as interpreted by the staff of the securities and exchange commission or the sec  requires us to invest at least of our assets in mortgages and other liens on and interest in real estate or qualifying real estate assets and at least of our assets in qualifying real estate assets plus real estate related assets 
the assets that we acquire  therefore  are limited by the provisions of the investment company act and the rules and regulations promulgated under the investment company act 
we rely on an interpretation that whole pool certificates that are issued or guaranteed by fannie mae  freddie mac or ginnie mae or agency whole pool certificates are qualifying real estate assets under section c c 
this interpretation was promulgated by the sec staff in a no action letter over years ago  was reaffirmed by the sec in and has been commonly relied on by mortgage reits 
on august   the sec issued a concept release titled companies engaged in the business of acquiring mortgages and mortgage related instruments sec release no 
ic 
under the concept release  the sec is reviewing interpretive issues related to the section c c exemption 
among other things  the sec specifically requested comments on whether it should revisit whether agency whole pool certificates may be treated as qualifying real estate assets and whether entities  such as us  whose primary business consists of investing in agency whole pool certificates are the type of entities that congress intended to be encompassed by the exclusion provided by section c c 
the potential outcomes of the sec s actions are unclear as is the sec s timetable for its review and actions 
we determined that as of december  and december   we were in compliance with the exemption from registration provided by section c c of the investment company act as interpreted by the staff of the sec 
as a result of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  the us commodity futures trading commission or cftc gained jurisdiction over the regulation of interest rate swaps 
the cftc has asserted that this causes the operators of mortgage real estate investment trusts that use swaps as part of their business model to fall within the statutory definition of commodity pool operator or cpo  and  absent relief from the division or the commission  to register as cpos 
on december   as a result of numerous requests for no action relief from the cpo registration requirement for operators of mortgage real estate investment trusts  the division of swap dealer and intermediary oversight of the cftc issued no action relief entitled no action relief from the commodity pool operator registration requirement for commodity pool operators of certain pooled investment vehicles organized as mortgage real estate investment trusts that permits a cpo to receive relief by filing a claim to perfect the use of the relief 
a claim submitted by a cpo will be effective upon filing  so long as the claim is materially complete 
the conditions that must be met to claim the relief are that the mortgage real estate investment trust must limit the initial margin and premiums required to establish its commodity interest positions to no more than percent of the fair market value of the mortgage real estate investment trust s total assets  limit the net income derived annually from its commodity interest positions that are not qualifying hedging transactions to less than five percent of the mortgage real estate investment trust s gross income  ensure that interests in the mortgage real estate investment trust are not marketed to the public as or in a commodity pool or otherwise as or in a vehicle for trading in the commodity futures  commodity options  or swaps markets  and either o identify itself as a mortgage reit in item g of its last us income tax return on form reit  or o if it has not yet filed its first us income tax return on form reit  but has disclosed to its shareholders that it intends to identify itself as a mortgage reit in its first us income tax return on form reit 
while we disagree that the cftc s position that mortgage real estate investment trusts that use swaps as part of their business model fall within the statutory definition of a cpo  we have submitted a claim for the relief set forth in the no action relief entitled no action relief from the commodity pool operator registration requirement for commodity pool operators of certain pooled investment vehicles organized as mortgage real estate investment trusts and believe we meet the criteria for such relief set forth therein 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk  which is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing liabilities  by affecting the spread between our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
changes in the level of interest rates also can affect the value of our agency mortgage backed securities and our ability to realize gains from the sale of these assets 
we may utilize a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps  floors  inverse floaters and other interest rate exchange contracts  in order to limit the effects of interest rates on our operations 
when we use these types of derivatives to hedge the risk of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities  we may be subject to certain risks  including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for payments to holders of securities and that the losses may exceed the amount we invested in the instruments 
our profitability and the value of our portfolio including interest rate swaps may be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
the following table quantifies the potential changes in economic net interest income and portfolio value  should interest rates go up or down  and basis points  assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other and the current yield curve 
all changes in income and value are measured as percentage changes from the projected net interest income and portfolio value at the base interest rate scenario 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at december  and various estimates regarding prepayment and all activities are made at each level of rate shock 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
change in interest rate projected percentage change in economic net interest income projected percentage change in portfolio value  with effect of interest rate swaps basis points basis points basis points base interest rate basis points basis points basis points economic net interest income includes interest expense on interest rate swaps 
asset and liability management asset and liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of the repricing of assets and liabilities 
we attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
methods for evaluating interest rate risk include an analysis of our interest rate sensitivity gap  which is the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
because different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in interest rates may affect net interest income positively or negatively even if an institution were perfectly matched in each maturity category 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  the amounts of assets and liabilities shown within a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of the assets and liabilities  except adjustable rate loans  and securities are included in the period in which their interest rates are first scheduled to adjust and not in the period in which they mature and does include the effect of the interest rate swaps 
the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities in the table could vary substantially based on actual prepayment experience 
within months months more than year to years years and over total dollars in thousands rate sensitive assets cash and cash equivalents reverse repurchase agreements us treasury securities securities borrowed agency mortgage backed securities principal agency debentures principal corporate debt total rate sensitive assets rate sensitive liabilities us treasury securities sold  not yet purchased repurchase agreements  with the effect of interest rate swaps securities loaned convertible senior notes principal total rate sensitive liabilities interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap as a percentage of total rate sensitive assets our analysis of risks is based on management s experience  estimates  models and assumptions 
these analyses rely on models which utilize estimates of fair value and interest rate sensitivity 
actual economic conditions or implementation of investment decisions by our management may produce results that differ significantly from the estimates and assumptions used in our models and the projected results shown in the above tables and in this report 
these analyses contain certain forward looking statements and are subject to the safe harbor statement set forth under the heading  special note regarding forward looking statements
