item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies 
our financial condition and results of operations have been adversely affected  and may continue to be adversely affected  by the us and international financial market and economic conditions 
we have been and continue to be impacted by general business and economic conditions in the united states and  to a lesser extent  abroad 
these conditions include short term and long term interest rates  inflation  money supply  political issues  legislative and regulatory changes  fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets  broad trends in industry and finance  unemployment and the strength of the us economy and the local economies in which the company operates  all of which are beyond the company s control 
continued deterioration in any of these conditions could result in an increase in loan delinquencies  and non performing assets  decreases in loan collateral values and a decrease in demand for the company s products and services 
while there are indications that the us economy is stabilizing  there remains significant uncertainty regarding the sustainability of the economic recovery 
continued market volatility may impact our business and the value of our common stock 
our business performance and the trading price of shares of our common stock may be affected by many factors affecting financial institutions  including volatility in the credit  mortgage and housing markets  the markets for securities relating to mortgages or housing  and the value of debt and mortgage backed and other securities that we hold in our investment portfolio 
government action and legislation may also impact us and the value of our common stock 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  volatility will have on our business or share price and for these and other reasons our shares of common stock may trade at a price lower than that at which they were purchased
