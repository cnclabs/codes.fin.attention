executive overview we are a global  diversified company whose many market leading brands deliver broad capabilities and a wide array of innovative  technology driven products and solutions for lifestyle improvement at home and at work 
our five reporting segments are as follows the residential ventilation resv segment  the technology solutions tech segment  the display mount solutions dms segment  the residential heating and cooling rhc segment  and the custom engineered solutions ces segment 
through these segments we manufacture and sell  primarily in the united states  canada  and europe  with additional manufacturing in china  a wide variety of products for the remodeling and replacement markets  the residential and commercial new construction markets  the manufactured housing market  and the personal and enterprise computer markets 
during the second quarter of  we changed the composition of our reporting segments to reflect the display mount solutions segment separately from the technology solutions segment due to the chief operating decision maker decision to operate the segments separately and manage each as a standalone  reportable segment 
as a result  we have restated prior period segment disclosures to conform to the new composition 
the resv segment  formerly known as the residential ventilation products rvp segment  primarily manufactures and sells room and whole house ventilation and other products  primarily for the professional remodeling and replacement markets  the residential new construction market  and the do it yourself market

on march   our board of directors approved new operational improvement initiatives and efforts to rationalize our global manufacturing and distribution capacity 
see liquidity and capital resources operational improvement initiatives below 
basis of presentation we operate on a calendar year  and for our interim periods  operate on a fiscal calendar  where each fiscal quarter is comprised of two week periods and one week period  with each week ending on a saturday 
our fiscal year always begins on january and ends on december as a result  our first and fourth quarters may have more or less days included than a traditional fiscal calendar  which consists of days 
this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to help the reader understand nortek  inc  our operations  and our present business environment

unless the context requires otherwise  the terms nortek  company  we  and our in this md a refer to nortek  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
fourth quarter debt transactions as discussed further below in liquidity and capital resources  on october   we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the new notes at an issue price of of principal  plus accrued interest from october  the new notes were offered as additional notes under the indenture pursuant to which we previously issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the original notes 
we received approximately million of gross proceeds in connection with the issuance of the new notes  which were used to pay down an equal amount of aggregate principal of our term loan facility 
we used cash on hand to pay accrued interest of approximately million related to the term loan facility and to pay underwriting  legal  and accounting fees of approximately million related to the issuance of the new notes 
the redemption of the term loan facility resulted in a pre tax loss of approximately million in the fourth quarter of

and subsidiaries management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations december  industry overview critical factors affecting our future performance  including our level of sales  profitability  and cash flows are the levels of residential remodeling and replacement activity  and new residential and non residential construction activity 
the level of new construction activity and the level of residential remodeling and replacement activity are affected by seasonality and cyclical factors such as interest rates  inflation  consumer spending  employment levels  and other macroeconomic factors over which we have no control 
any decline in economic activity as a result of these or other factors typically results in a decline in residential and non residential new construction and  to a lesser extent  residential and non residential remodeling and replacement spending  which would result in a decrease in our sales  profitability  and cash flows 
instability in the credit and financial markets  troubles in the mortgage market  the level of unemployment  and the decline in home values could have a negative impact on residential and non residential new construction activity  consumer disposable income  and spending on home remodeling and repairs 
these factors could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
changes in key industry activity affecting our businesses in the north america for   and as compared to the prior year periods were as follows source of increase decrease data private residential construction spending total us housing starts total canadian housing starts new home sales existing home sales residential improvement spending central air conditioning and heat pump shipments gas furnace shipments private non residential construction spending manufactured housing shipments residential fixed investment spending source of data us census bureau canada mortgage and housing corporation national association of realtors air conditioning  heating and refrigeration institute institute for building technology and safety us bureau of economic analysis in  approximately of consolidated net sales were made through independent distributors  dealers  wholesalers and similar channels  approximately were to commercial hvac markets  approximately were to retailers of which approximately were sold to the four largest home center retailers  approximately were private label sales and approximately were to manufactured housing original equipment manufacturers and aftermarket dealers 
our largest distributor or dealer accounted for approximately of consolidated net sales in our largest customer other than a distributor or dealer accounted for approximately of consolidated net sales for based on internal research and analysis  we estimate that approximately to of our consolidated net sales were related to the residential housing market 
our products that serve the residential housing market primarily include range hoods and bath fans sold by our resv segment  central air conditioning and heating products sold by our rhc segment  and security and access control products and certain of the audio video distribution and control products sold by our tech segment 
we believe that approximately to of our consolidated net sales to the residential housing market were related to new construction activity 

table of contents nortek  inc 
and subsidiaries management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations december  also based on internal research and analysis  we estimate that approximately to of our consolidated net sales were related to non residential applications including healthcare and educational institutions 
our products that serve the non residential market primarily include air handlers and other heating and cooling products sold by our ces segment  digital mounting and mobility products sold by our dms segment  and certain of the audio video distribution and control products sold by our tech segment 
we believe that approximately to of our consolidated net sales to the non residential market were related to new construction activity 
the demand for certain of our products is seasonal  particularly in the northeast and midwest regions of the united states 
inclement weather during winter months usually reduces the level of building and remodeling activity in both home improvement and new construction markets  thereby reducing our sales levels during the first and fourth quarters 
we are subject to the effects of changing prices and the impact of inflation which could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations 
in some circumstances  market conditions or customer expectations may prevent us from increasing the prices of our products to offset the inflationary pressures that may increase costs in the future 
we continually review the costs of our product lines and look for opportunities to help offset the rising costs of raw materials and transportation when possible 
during the past three years  the following have been our major purchases  expressed as a percentage of consolidated net sales  of raw materials and purchased components for the year ended december  steel motors compressors copper electrical packaging plastics aluminum outlook for  we expect activity in the residential and non residential construction markets to be slightly up from the levels we experienced in during  us housing starts  as well as new and existing home sales  were up as compared to we believe  however  that it is premature to conclude that a sustainable housing recovery is under way as the united states and certain other countries still face relatively high unemployment levels  stricter mortgage lending practices  and consumers expectations of longer term future housing price values are likely to decline rather than increase 
these factors are likely to continue weighing on housing starts  housing prices  and sales of new and existing homes 
in addition  economic conditions such as high unemployment and weak consumer confidence  are having a continued unfavorable impact on the level of remodeling and replacement expenditures in our markets 
as discussed in liquidity and capital resources operational improvement initiatives  we have begun operational improvement initiatives which we expect will result in significant improvements in efficiencies and reductions in operating costs and expenses  both in our manufacturing processes and in our administrative functions  which will better align us with the markets we serve and will improve our overall competitiveness 
while we will continue to closely manage our expenses and cash flow  we expect to continue funding these initiatives in and beyond 
with liquidity from cash on hand and borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility  we have the capability to benefit significantly from even a modest rebound in end market demand

and subsidiaries management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations december  acquisitions we account for acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting and accordingly  the results of these acquisitions are included in our consolidated results from the date of their acquisition 
we have made the following acquisitions since january  reporting segment acquired company acquisition date primary business of acquired company tech skycam  llc luxor july  distribution and sale of security cameras and digital video recorders via the internet 
dms ergotron  inc december  design  manufacture and sale of innovative  ergonomic mounting and mobility products for computer monitors  notebooks and flat panel displays in the united states and other parts of the world 
tech tv one broadcast sales corporation  barcom uk holdings limited  and barcom asia holdings  llc april  design  manufacture and sale of a complete range of video signal processing products for the professional audio video and broadcast markets 
we selected december  as the date to record the acquisition of ergotron  inc as the effect of using december   instead of december   was not material to our financial condition or results of operations for fiscal accordingly  the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  does not include any activity related to ergotron  inc for the period from december  to december  as previously disclosed  on february   we announced that we had signed a definitive agreement to acquire gig technologies  inc gig  an innovative designer and manufacturer of residential security and home automation systems 
the transaction is expected to close by the first half of we expect to include gig in our tech segment 
critical accounting estimates this md a is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of judgment in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we periodically evaluate the judgments and estimates used for our critical accounting policies to ensure that such judgments and estimates are reasonable for our interim and year end reporting requirements 
these judgments and estimates are based upon our historical experience  current trends and other information available  as appropriate 
if actual conditions are different from those assumptions used in our judgments  actual results could be materially different from our estimates 
our critical accounting policies are discussed below 
revenue recognition  accounts receivable and related expenses we generally recognize sales based upon shipment of products to customers and have procedures in place at each of our subsidiaries to ensure that an accurate cut off is obtained for each reporting period 
we consider revenue to be realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue is recognized upon passage of title and risk of loss to customers  unless we are required to provide additional services  and provided we can form an estimate for sales returns 
when a sale arrangement involves training  installation  or other deliverables  the arrangement is evaluated to determine whether it represents a multiple element arrangement 
we recognize revenue on such multiple element arrangements in accordance with accounting standards update asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu  based on the estimated selling price of each element 
in accordance with asu  we use vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  if available  to determine the selling price of each element 
if vsoe is not available  we use third party evidence or our best estimated selling price to determine the selling price for each element 
allowances for cash discounts  volume rebates  other customer incentive programs and gross customer returns  among others  are recorded as a reduction of sales at the time of sale based upon the estimated future outcome 
cash discounts  volume rebates and other customer incentive programs are based upon certain percentages agreed to with our various customers  which are typically 
table of contents nortek  inc 
and subsidiaries management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations december  earned by the customer over an annual period 
we record periodic estimates for these amounts based upon the historical results to date  estimated future results through the end of the contract period  and the contractual provisions of the customer agreements 
for calendar year customer agreements  we are able to adjust our periodic estimates to actual amounts as of december each year based upon the contractual provisions of the customer agreements 
for those customers who have agreements that are not on a calendar year cycle  we record estimates at december consistent with the above described methodology 
customers are generally not required to provide collateral for purchases 
as a result  at the end of any given reporting period  the amounts recorded for these allowances are based upon estimates of the likely outcome of future sales with the applicable customers and may require adjustment in the future if the actual outcome differs 
we believe that our procedures for estimating such amounts are reasonable 
customer returns are recorded on an actual basis throughout the year and also include an estimate at the end of each reporting period for future customer returns related to sales recorded prior to the end of the period 
we generally estimate customer returns based upon the time lag that historically occurs between the date of the sale and the date of the return  while also factoring in any new business conditions that might impact the historical analysis  such as new product introductions 
we believe that our procedures for estimating such amounts are reasonable 
provisions for the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts are recorded in selling  general and administrative expense  net sg a 
the amounts recorded are generally based upon historically derived percentages while also factoring in any new business conditions that might impact the historical analysis such as changes in economic conditions  past due and nonperforming accounts  bankruptcies or other events affecting particular customers 
we also periodically evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as a further test to ensure the adequacy of the recorded provisions 
the analysis for allowance for doubtful accounts often involves subjective analysis of a particular customer s ability to pay 
as a result  significant judgment is required in determining the appropriate amounts to record and such judgments may prove to be incorrect in the future 
we believe that our procedures for estimating such amounts are reasonable 
inventory valuation we value inventories at the lower of the cost or market with approximately of our inventory at december  valued using the last in  first out lifo method and the remainder valued using the first in  first out fifo method 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
in connection with both lifo and fifo inventories  we record provisions  as appropriate  to write down obsolete and excess inventory to estimated net realizable value 
the process for evaluating obsolete and excess inventory often requires us to make subjective judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels  quantities  and prices at which such inventory will be able to be sold in the normal course of business 
accelerating the disposal process or incorrect estimates of future sales potential may cause the actual results to differ from the estimates at the time such inventory is disposed or sold 
we believe that our procedures for estimating such amounts are reasonable 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with asc topic  income taxes asc  which requires that the deferred tax consequences of temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the amounts included in our federal  state and foreign income tax returns to be recognized in the balance sheet 
as we generally do not file our income tax returns until well after the closing process for the december financial statements is complete  the amounts recorded at december reflect estimates of what the final amounts will be when the actual tax returns are filed for that fiscal year 
in addition  estimates are often required with respect to  among other things  the appropriate state income tax rates to use in the various states that we and our subsidiaries are required to file  the potential utilization of operating and capital loss carry forwards and valuation allowances required  if any  for tax assets that may not be realizable in the future 
we require each of our subsidiaries to submit year end tax information packages as part of the year end financial statement closing process so that the information used to estimate the deferred tax accounts at december is reasonably consistent with the amounts expected to be included in the filed tax returns 
asc requires balance sheet classification of current and long term deferred income tax assets and liabilities based upon the classification of the underlying asset or liability that gives rise to a temporary difference 
as such  we have historically had prepaid income tax assets due principally to the unfavorable tax consequences of recording expenses for required book reserves for such things as  among others  bad debts  inventory valuation  insurance  product liability and warranty that cannot be deducted for income tax purposes until such expenses are actually paid 
we believe the procedures and estimates used in our accounting for income taxes are reasonable and in accordance with established tax law 
the income tax estimates used have historically not resulted in material adjustments to income tax expense in subsequent periods when the estimates are adjusted

goodwill evaluation of goodwill impairment our accounting for acquired goodwill requires considerable judgment in the valuation thereof  and the ongoing evaluation of potential impairment 
goodwill is not amortized 
instead  it is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value  including a significant adverse change in the business climate  among others 
we have set the annual evaluation date as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter 
the reporting units evaluated for goodwill impairment have been determined to be the same as our operating segments 
only the resv  dms  and tech reporting units have goodwill and  therefore  are the only reporting units that currently are required to be evaluated for goodwill impairment 
in  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment asu  which introduced an optional qualitative assessment for testing goodwill impairment 
under asu  if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount  we are not required to perform the annual quantitative two step impairment test under asc topic  goodwill and other asc 
we adopted asu in and used the qualitative assessment approach in connection with our annual impairment evaluation for the resv and dms reporting units  and our annual impairment evaluation for the resv  dms and tech reporting units 
the following analyses were performed in connection with the and annual qualitative assessment under asu and are performed  if necessary  on an interim basis in order to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our applicable reporting units are below the respective carrying amounts we review public information from competitors and other industry information to determine if there are any significant adverse trends in our competitors businesses  such as significant declines in market capitalization or significant goodwill impairment charges that could be an indication that the goodwill of our reporting units is potentially impaired 
we review changes in our market capitalization and overall enterprise valuation to determine if there are any significant decreases that could be an indication that the valuation of our reporting units has significantly decreased 
we review  and update if necessary  our long term year financial projections and compare them to the prior long term year projections to determine if there has been a significant adverse change that could materially lower our prior valuation conclusions under both the discounted cash flow dcf approach and the earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda multiple approach 
we determine if there have been any significant increases to the weighted average cost of capital wacc rates for each reporting unit  which could materially lower our prior valuation conclusions under the dcf approach 
we determine if there have been any significant decreases to our estimated ebitda multiples  which could materially lower our prior valuation conclusions under the ebitda multiple approach 
we determine the current carrying value for each reporting unit as of the end of the quarter and compare it to the previously determined amount in order to determine if there has been any significant increase that could impact our prior goodwill impairment assessments 
we also  as necessary  run pro forma models substituting the new assumption information derived from the above analyses to determine the impact that such assumption changes would have had on the prior valuations 
these pro forma calculations assist us in determining whether or not the new valuation assumption information would have resulted in a significant decrease in the fair value of any of the reporting units 

table of contents nortek  inc 
and subsidiaries management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations december  based on these analyses  we make a final determination as to whether or not it is more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit with goodwill is lower than its carrying value 
if this were to be the case  then a step test is required under asc the step test compares the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the estimated fair value is lower than the carrying value  there is an indication of goodwill impairment and a step test is required 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value  no further goodwill impairment testing is required 
the step fair value estimation includes a combination of a dcf approach and an ebitda multiple approach 
the dcf approach requires that we forecast future cash flows of the reporting unit s and discount the cash flow stream s based upon a wacc rate that is derived  in part  from comparable companies within similar industries 
the dcf calculations also include a terminal value calculation that is based upon an expected long term growth rate for the applicable reporting unit 
the ebitda multiple approach requires that we estimate certain valuation multiples of ebitda derived from comparable companies and apply those derived ebitda multiples to the applicable reporting unit ebitda for the selected ebitda measurement periods 
we then evaluate what we believe to be the appropriate weighted average of the dcf approach and the ebitda multiple approach in order to arrive at our estimated fair value 
the key assumptions used in order to determine the appropriate wacc rates for the dcf approach are as follows a risk free rate based on the year united states treasury bond yield 
a market risk premium based on our assessment of the additional risk associated with equity investment that is determined  in part  through the use of published historical equity risk studies as adjusted for the business risk index for each reporting unit 
the business risk index is derived from comparable companies and measures the estimated stock price volatility 
as such  changes in the market risk premium between periods reflect changes in the business risk index for the reporting units 
comparable company and market interest rate information is used to determine the cost of debt and the appropriate long term capital structure in order to weight the cost of debt and the cost of equity into an overall wacc 
a size risk premium based on the value of the reporting unit that is determined through the use of published historical size risk premia data 
a specific risk premium for the cost of equity  as necessary  which factors in overall economic and stock market volatility conditions at the time the wacc is estimated 
annual impairment test we determined that it was appropriate for us to use the qualitative assessment approach under asu for the annual goodwill impairment evaluation performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter based on the fact that the estimated fair values of the resv and dms derived in our valuation analysis continued to be significantly in excess of the carrying values 
based on the qualitative analysis performed  as described above  we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of these evaluated reporting units was greater than their carrying amounts as of the first day of the fourth quarter 
accordingly  we were not required to perform the two step impairment test under asc topic for for resv and dms 
for the annual impairment test for tech  we estimated the fair value of the reporting unit using a weighted average of for the dcf approach and for the ebitda approach  which we determined to be the most representative allocation for the estimate of the long term fair value of the reporting unit 
the tech valuation assumed a taxable transaction  with a wacc of  and ebitda multiples in the range of x to x for the selected measurement periods of the latest twelve months through september   and forecasted and as the estimated fair value of tech was greater than the carrying value  no step test for goodwill impairment was required 
we believe that our assumptions used to estimate the fair value of tech as of the first day of the fourth quarter were reasonable 
if different assumptions were used  particularly with respect to estimating future cash flows  weighted average costs of capital  and terminal growth rates  different estimates of fair value may have resulted 
we estimate that the fair value of tech would have needed to be reduced by approximately to reduce the estimated fair value to an amount below the carrying value 
as of december   we determined that there were no indicators of impairment and  therefore  no interim impairment testing was required for the resv  dms  or tech reporting units as of that date 

table of contents nortek  inc 
and subsidiaries management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations december  annual impairment test we determined that it was appropriate for us to use the qualitative assessment approach under asu for the annual goodwill impairment evaluation based on the fact that the fair values of the resv and tech reporting units were significantly in excess of the carrying values in see below  and the fact that substantially all of the dms reporting unit was a recently completed acquisition 
based on the qualitative analysis performed  as described above  we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the three evaluated reporting units was greater than their carrying amounts as of the first day of the fourth quarter 
accordingly  we were not required to perform the two step impairment test under asc topic for as of december   we determined that there were no indicators of impairment and  therefore  no interim impairment testing was required for the resv  dms  or tech reporting units as of that date 
annual impairment test we performed our annual tests of goodwill impairment for as of october  the adoption of fresh start accounting in resulted in a significant reduction in goodwill for resv and the elimination of all remaining goodwill for tech  rhc and ces 
we acquired skycam llc on july   which resulted in the recognition of approximately million of goodwill that was included in our annual goodwill impairment testing as of october   in the tech reporting unit 
the acquisition of ergotron  which resulted in estimated goodwill of approximately million  occurred subsequent to the annual impairment testing and therefore the dms reporting unit was not required to be included in the annual test 
as of october   the results of the step tests indicated that the fair value of the resv and tech reporting units exceeded their carrying value and  therefore  that no additional goodwill impairment analysis was required 
as of december  we determined that there were no indicators of impairment and  therefore  no interim impairment testing was required for any of the reporting units with goodwill as of that date 
other long lived assets in accordance with asc topic  property  plant and equipment asc  we evaluate the realizability of long lived assets  which primarily consists of property and equipment and definite lived intangible assets the asc long lived assets  when events or business conditions warrant it  as well as whenever an interim goodwill impairment test is required under asc asc requires that the asc impairment test be completed  and any asc impairment be recorded  prior to performing the goodwill impairment test 
in accordance with asc  the evaluation of the impairment of long lived assets  other than goodwill  is based on expectations of non discounted future cash flows compared to the carrying value of the long lived asset groups 
if the sum of the expected non discounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asc long lived assets  we would recognize an impairment loss 
our cash flow estimates are based upon historical cash flows  as well as future projected cash flows received from subsidiary management in connection with our annual company wide planning process and interim forecasting  and  if appropriate  include a terminal valuation for the applicable subsidiary based upon an ebitda multiple 
we estimate the ebitda multiples by reviewing comparable company information and other industry data 
we believe that our procedures for estimating gross future cash flows  including the terminal valuation  were reasonable and consistent with current market conditions for each of the dates when impairment testing has been performed 
there were no long lived asset impairment charges recorded during  or 
table of contents nortek  inc 
and subsidiaries management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations december  pensions and post retirement health benefits our accounting for pensions  including supplemental executive retirement plans and post retirement health benefit liabilities  requires estimates of such items as the long term average return on plan assets  the discount rate  the rate of compensation increase and the assumed medical cost inflation rate 
we utilize long term investment grade bond yields as the basis for selecting a discount rate by which plan obligations are measured 
an analysis of projected cash flows for each plan is performed in order to determine plan specific duration 
discount rates are selected based on high quality corporate bond yields of similar durations 
these estimates require a significant amount of judgment as items such as stock market fluctuations  changes in interest rates  plan amendments  and curtailments can have a significant impact on the assumptions used and  therefore  on the ultimate final actuarial determinations for a particular year 
we believe the procedures and estimates used in our accounting for pensions and post retirement health benefits are reasonable and consistent with acceptable actuarial practices in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
warranty we sell a number of products and offer a number of warranties including  in some instances  extended warranties for which we receive proceeds 
the specific terms and conditions of these warranties vary depending on the product sold and the country in which the product is sold 
we estimate the costs that may be incurred under our warranties  with the exception of extended warranties  and record a liability for such costs at the time of sale 
deferred revenue from extended warranties is recorded at the estimated fair value and is amortized over the life of the warranty 
the related deferred revenue is reviewed to ensure that the amount recorded is equal to or greater than estimated future costs 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of units sold  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims  cost per claim  and new product introduction 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded reserves for warranty claims and adjust the amounts as necessary 
warranty claims can extend far into the future 
as a result  significant judgment is required in determining the appropriate amounts to record and such judgments may prove to be incorrect in the future 
we believe that our procedures for estimating such amounts are reasonable 
insurance liabilities  including product liability we record insurance liabilities and related expenses for health  workers compensation  product and general liability losses  and other insurance reserves and expenses in accordance with either the contractual terms of our policies or  if self insured  the total liabilities that are estimable and probable as of the reporting date 
insurance liabilities are recorded as current liabilities to the extent payments are expected to be made in the succeeding year  with the remaining requirements classified as long term liabilities 
the accounting for self insured plans requires that significant judgments and estimates be made both with respect to the future liabilities to be paid for known claims  and incurred but not reported claims as of the reporting date 
we consider historical trends when determining the appropriate insurance reserves to record 
in certain cases where partial insurance coverage exists  we must estimate the portion of the liability that will be covered by existing insurance policies to arrive at our net expected liability 
receivables for insurance recoveries for product liability claims are recorded as assets  on an undiscounted basis  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
these recoveries are estimated based on the contractual arrangements with vendors and other third parties as well as historical trends 
we believe that our procedures for estimating such amounts are reasonable

product liability  environmental and other legal proceedings also include matters with respect to businesses previously owned 
we provide accruals for direct costs  including legal costs  associated with the estimated resolution of contingencies at the earliest date at which it is deemed probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated 
costs accrued have been estimated based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and outcomes 
legal costs for other than probable contingencies are expensed when services are performed 
while it is impossible to ascertain the ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to contingent liabilities  including lawsuits  we believe that the aggregate amount of such liabilities  if any  in excess of amounts provided or covered by insurance  will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular future period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or strategies related to these contingencies  or changes out of our control

share based compensation expense we measure share based compensation expense at fair value in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation asc  and recognizes such expense over the vesting period of the share based awards 
the estimated fair value of options granted is measured on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the risk free interest rate for periods within the life of the option is based upon a blend of us treasury bond rates with maturities equal to the expected term of the options 
prior to december  the expected term assumption was derived using a binomial model analysis 
commencing with grants made in december  the expected term assumption was derived using the simplified method  as described in sec staff accounting bulletin topic d  share based payment certain assumptions used in valuation methods 
this change in estimation methodology did not have a material impact on the resulting estimated fair value of options granted 
the expected volatility assumption is based upon the historical volatility of comparable public companies stock as well as the implied volatility of outstanding options for the comparable companies that had such options 
the dividend yield represents the expected dividends on the company common stock for the expected term of the option 
to date  the expected dividend yield has been estimated at zero for all options measured 
a significant change in interest rates  stock volatility  or the company expected dividend rate would have a direct impact on the estimated fair value of options granted subsequent to such a change  and related expense 
the estimated fair value of restricted stock granted is based upon the closing price of the company stock on the date of grant 
in addition to restricted stock awards with time based vesting  the company has also granted performance based awards 
expense related to restricted stock awards with performance based vesting conditions is recognized as it becomes probable that the restricted shares will vest 
certain of these awards have multi year cumulative performance targets 
changes in estimate with respect to the probability of vesting could have a significant effect upon the amount of expense recognized in a given period

and subsidiaries management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations december  the remainder of this discussion provides greater detail of our operating results for each of our reporting segments 
our reporting segments offer a significant number of different products across a wide range of price points and numerous distribution channels that do not always allow meaningful quantitative analysis to be performed with respect to the effect on net sales of changes in units sold or the price per unit sold 
however  whenever the underlying causes of material increases or decreases in consolidated net sales can be adequately analyzed and quantified  we attempt to make appropriate disclosure of such reasons  including changes in price  volume  and the mix of products sold 
overall  changes in cogs including material  direct labor  overhead  and freight costs as a percentage of net sales for one period as compared to another period may reflect a number of factors including changes in the relative mix of products sold  the effect of changes in sales prices and material costs  as well as changes in productivity levels 
we report our financial results in accordance with us gaap 
however  we believe that certain non gaap performance measures used in managing the business may provide users of this financial information with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods 
non gaap performance measures should be viewed in addition to  and not as an alternative for  our reported results 
we provide net sales and cost of products sold excluding the impact of foreign currency as a supplement to net sales and cost of products sold as determined by us gaap in order to provide readers with a clearer basis to assess our results over time 
this measure is considered a non gaap financial measure and is calculated by translating the current period net sales and cost of products sold in functional currency to us dollars using the prior year exchange rate

in connection with the combination of these businesses  management has identified certain products that are either redundant or not competitive and  therefore  have been or will be discontinued 
cost of goods sold in includes approximately million to reduce inventory values for these products to their expected net realizable amounts 
in addition  sg a in includes approximately million of severance and other exit costs in connection with the combinations 
we anticipate recording additional expenses of between approximately million and million related to these activities 
cogs in includes a charge to overhead costs of approximately million relating to the decision to discontinue development of a product 
this decision was based on the less than expected interest in this product and the availability of competing products within the tech segment that are expected to have greater market potential 
the charge is comprised of reserves to reduce remaining inventories to their net realizable value  costs to cancel open purchase orders  costs of products returned  and the accelerated depreciation of tooling equipment 
cogs for also includes the impact of a prior year acquisition of approximately million and  for  includes approximately million of additional warranty expense primarily related to a certain security customer 
as noted in the above table  the percentage of cogs to net sales increased for  primarily as a result of an increase in material and overhead costs as a percentage of net sales 
the increase in material costs as a percentage of net sales is mainly attributable to the mix of products sold 
the increase in overhead costs primarily relates to the items discussed above  coupled with a decrease in net sales without a proportionate decrease in costs due to the fixed nature of certain overhead costs the increase in sg a as a percentage of net sales for is primarily the result of the impact of a prior year acquisition of approximately million  an increase in severance and other charges relating to exit and disposal activities of approximately million  and approximately million of increased spending levels for product development 
these increases were partially offset by the result of cost reductions associated with combining the operations of certain subsidiaries within the segment  discussed earlier

table of contents nortek  inc 
and subsidiaries management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations december  net sales in the dms segment increased approximately million during as compared to this increase is attributable to increased sales volume of the segment branded products primarily in the americas and asia pacific regions  while european sales were relatively flat 
in addition  direct sales to original equipment manufacturer oem customers were higher due to sales of new products and increased volume of existing products 
these increases were partially offset by the planned withdrawal from low margin oem indirect business

these increases were offset somewhat by the impact of the mild winter weather experienced over much of the country during the first quarter of  and an increase in first quarter sales to certain customers serving the residential site built market for use as replacement products  among others 
the decrease in cogs as a percentage of net sales is primarily the result of a decrease in material costs as a percentage of net sales  primarily the result of engineered product cost reductions  lower prices related to the purchase of steel  copper  and aluminum  as well as increased sales prices 
overhead for includes a decrease of approximately million of depreciation expense 
the remaining decrease in overhead as a percentage of net sales is primarily the result of improved operational efficiencies and an increase in net sales without a proportionate increase in costs due to the fixed nature of certain overhead costs  partially offset by higher freight costs

this increase in net sales is primarily the result of increased shipment levels of air handlers  clean room equipment and packaged equipment in the us market 
backlog for ces products expected to be filled within the next twelve months was approximately million at december  and approximately million at december  this decrease in backlog since december  is the result of the fulfillment of orders in process at the end of and was expected due to several large orders placed in that did not repeat in  coupled with a slowdown in the incoming order rate reflecting a slower non residential construction market since the beginning of the year 
the decrease in material costs as a percentage of net sales in is the result of changes in product mix  and lower costs relating to the purchase of steel  copper  and aluminum 
this decrease in material costs partially offsets lower pricing in the decrease in labor costs as a percentage of net sales for primarily reflects improved efficiencies and a slight change in mix to higher margin products 
the decrease in overhead as a percentage of net sales for is primarily due to higher sales volume without a proportionate increase in overhead  as well as product and process improvements made at several companies

the indentures related to our notes and notes  the credit agreements governing our abl facility and term loan facility  and other agreements governing our indebtedness and the indebtedness of our subsidiaries contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants  including covenants that restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to complete acquisitions  pay dividends or make other payments or distributions  incur additional indebtedness  make loans or investments  incur certain liens  enter into transactions with affiliates  consolidate  merge or sell assets  and take certain other corporate actions 
see note  notes  mortgage notes and obligations payable to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report and debt covenant compliance below 
we believe that our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents as of december   our estimated cash flows from our subsidiaries  and borrowings available under our abl facility will be sufficient to fund our operations  anticipated capital expenditures  including potential acquisitions  and debt repayment obligations through at least the next twelve months based on our current operating plan 
we believe that our primary long term capital requirements relate to servicing and repaying our indebtedness

see contractual obligations below for detail on our payment obligations under our indebtedness 
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
our ability to generate cash in the future will be dependent upon  among other things  the performance of our operating segments  and general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
our ability to repay our outstanding indebtedness will also depend on our ability to access the capital markets in order to refinance all amounts outstanding under the notes  the notes  the abl facility and the term loan facility  as we do not anticipate generating sufficient cash flow from operations to repay such amounts in full 
there can be no assurance that funds will be available to us in the capital markets  together with cash generated from operations  in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
additionally  there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness  including the notes  the notes  the abl facility and the term loan facility  on commercially reasonable terms or at all

management considers these initiatives to be important to our ability to maintain and improve our position in many of our markets and to allow us to expand in certain other markets 
these initiatives address a wide variety of key areas of operations  including  for example  i optimizing the number and location of manufacturing  warehousing and distribution facilities  ii optimizing our procurement sources and processes  iii determining the potential for leveraging administrative resources across various operating groups  iv combining and or relocating individual operations to leverage common management  v implementing global information systems to facilitate communication and resource sharing in areas such as finance and human resources and vi introducing new products and expanding our presence in certain markets 

table of contents nortek  inc 
and subsidiaries management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations december  given the wide ranging impact of these initiatives  we have made or plan to make significant incremental investments in staffing  research and development projects and specialized consulting resources 
for example  in  we expanded our staff with senior individuals with expertise in pertinent  impacted operational areas such as information technology  human resources and supply chain management 
we have also engaged certain additional  third party resources with specialization in the areas of manufacturing rationalization  procurement  logistics and process optimization 
the cost of these investments in external resources in approximated million  and is expected to range from approximately million to million in manufacturing capacity and distribution rationalization rationalization of our global manufacturing and distribution capacity is an important objective of the operational improvement initiatives 
currently  our manufacturing locations are primarily located throughout north america  europe and china 
we believe that consolidation and relocation of parts of our manufacturing operations to lower cost regions will provide significant cost reduction opportunities which are important to our future competitiveness 
with the assistance of third party consultants  who have expertise in this area  we have reviewed our worldwide manufacturing footprint to identify the extent of such opportunities given the products and markets that comprise our business 
in considering potential alternatives  we consider  among other things  the availability and cost of skilled labor  proximity to supply sources  customers and similar logistical concerns  and regulatory environments and level of support provided by local governments 
on march   in connection with the implementation of these new operational improvement initiatives and  in particular  our efforts to rationalize our global manufacturing capacity  our board of directors approved the following initiatives i construction of two new manufacturing facilities on a campus in mexico to be shared by our rhc and ces segments  which will provide an integrated manufacturing footprint for both rhc and ces  ii consolidation of two north american manufacturing facilities in the rhc segment into the new  shared facility in mexico  and iii transfer of product manufacturing from certain manufacturing facilities in the ces segment to the new  shared campus in mexico  as well as transferring and expanding parts and sub assembly operations in mexico 
we expect that the total cost to complete these manufacturing relocation projects  which will impact approximately of nortek global workforce  will approximate million to million  with cash expenditures to begin in the second quarter of and continue through fiscal year the total cost of these manufacturing relocation projects  substantially all of which will result in cash expenditures  will be primarily comprised of approximately million to million of machinery and equipment relocation and installation costs including approximately million of capital expenditures  approximately million to million of costs associated with duplicate overhead and inefficiencies during the relocation period  approximately million to million of employee related costs  a substantial majority of which are related to the rhc segment  and approximately million to million of other associated costs  including approximately million to million of on going higher inventory levels 
in addition  in order to assure that product availability is not disrupted and that there is no deterioration in customer service levels  we expect to increase our investment in inventory by million to million during the transition period 
further  the board approved expenditures of approximately million in restructuring costs related to potential future footprint rationalization strategies 
one of the central factors needed to achieve our long term goals of creating a cost advantaged  scalable network that supports growth and innovation is to position our manufacturing operations where we can cost competitively manufacture product  as well as enhance our competitive capability with the ability to grow certain product lines and expand into new markets 
we believe that consolidation and relocation of parts of our manufacturing capacity for the rhc and ces segments to mexico will provide significant cost reduction opportunities 
we expect these manufacturing relocation projects to generate cost savings as a result of reduced labor costs available in mexico and from the leveraging of fixed overhead that will result from consolidating facilities 
our primary objective with respect to these initiatives is an improved competitive cost structure that will enable us to drive growth and profitability 
on march   in connection with our efforts to optimize supply chain performance  our board of directors also approved entry into a five year agreement with a third party logistics service provider to outsource certain warehousing and distribution activities in our north american operating segments and facilitate the consolidation of north american warehousing distribution centers 
we expect this process of outsourcing and consolidation  which will impact approximately of nortek global workforce and reduce our warehousing and distribution footprint by approximately  to cost approximately million to million to be incurred over a month period commencing in our second quarter 
this cost  substantially all of which will result in cash expenditures  is primarily comprised of approximately million to million of lease cancellation costs  approximately million to million of costs associated with systems implementation  approximately million to million of employee related costs  and approximately million of other associated costs 
we expect these initiatives to generate cost savings as a result of moving to shared distribution centers and leveraging our scale by optimizing our shipments and consolidating our facilities 

table of contents nortek  inc 
and subsidiaries management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations december  we expect that of the approximately million to million of costs related to the manufacturing relocation and warehousing and distribution consolidation initiatives  approximately million in restructuring expense will be incurred in with the remainder being incurred in and each of these manufacturing relocation projects and warehousing and distribution outsourcing and consolidation initiatives is aimed at optimizing our global manufacturing footprint and logistical structure to ensure that capacity is located in areas where customer service can be maximized 
procurement and sourcing we believe that we have a significant opportunity to reduce our manufacturing material cost  as well as our indirect non manufacturing costs  by optimizing our procurement sources and processes 
while our current procurement functions are mostly disaggregated and autonomous throughout our various operations  we believe that consolidating supplier sources and negotiating terms and pricing in a uniform and centralized manner will allow us to leverage our scale which will result in more competitive costs and services from our suppliers 
we have appointed a new senior executive to lead this important initiative  and we have engaged third party resources with expertise in procurement processes to assist us 
combining operations in our tech segment  we have combined a number of independently managed operations into common entities in order to leverage management costs  consolidate warehousing  distribution and administrative locations and share common information system platforms 
further  combining certain of these businesses allows us to rationalize product offerings  eliminate competing products among different operations  optimize product development and marketing costs  and provide greater focus and support to our customers 
an example of such a consolidation of businesses in is the newly established core brands group within the tech segment which was formed by combining three discrete companies with overlapping product offerings  sales and marketing organizations and physical locations 
likewise  the establishment of the pro av group in the tech segment in allowed us to consolidate the management and operations of three companies into a single entity  providing the potential for cost reductions and improved customer focus and service levels  among other benefits 
leveraging resources and sharing systems we believe implementing common information system platforms in certain areas and combining administrative functions when appropriate will allow us to improve efficiency and service levels and also reduce costs 
an example of such an area is human resources 
with a total workforce of approximately  on continents  we believe a common human resource information platform will  among other things  allow us to synchronize human resource processes and policies  improve the management of compensation levels  improve utilization of specialized resources  share resources among different organizations  and provide greater opportunities for our worldwide workforce to grow and develop within the overall nortek organization 
we have identified and are in the process of implementing a common human resource information system platform  and we expect the implementation process will continue through product development and marketing we have a number of strategies and initiatives across our segments which will require increased levels of spending in product development and marketing to support these plans 
overall  in we expect to spend approximately million to million more than to support these initiatives 
most of our operational improvement initiatives are medium to long term initiatives which we expect will be completed at various times through while the economic benefits of these initiatives are not quantifiable at this point and will not begin to be fully realized until well after these initiatives have been established  management believes these initiatives will provide significant benefits well into the future 
we may incur additional costs to implement these initiatives  which may include the cost of relocating manufacturing and distribution locations in addition to the facilities discussed above  retrofitting existing or building new facilities  reducing our work force  rationalizing or refreshing product lines  and other costs 
while we are not able to estimate such additional costs  if any  we believe that our initiatives will provide significant benefits and will create a foundation for growth and a sustainable competitive advantage well into the future 
restructurings  facility shutdowns and integration of operations involve numerous risks in their implementation including unforeseen costs  business disruption and management distraction  among others  and may be more costly than expected 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the expected costs to be incurred in connection with these initiatives  including those above  or the economic benefits expected to be achieved  will occur as contemplated

and subsidiaries management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations december  consolidated cash flow and adjusted consolidated cash flow consolidated cash flow ccf represents net earnings loss before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization including the effects of fresh start accounting  and loss from debt retirement 
the accf is defined as the ccf further adjusted to exclude certain cash and non cash  non recurring items 
ccf and accf are not defined terms under us gaap 
neither ccf nor accf should be considered an alternative to operating income or net earnings loss as a measure of operating results 
there are material limitations associated with making the adjustments to our earnings to calculate ccf and accf and using these non us gaap financial measures as compared to the most directly comparable us gaap financial measures 
for instance  ccf and accf do not include interest expense  and  because we have borrowed money in order to finance our operations  interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue  depreciation and amortization expense  and  because we use capital assets  depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue  income tax expense  and because the payment of taxes is part of our operations  tax expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to operate  or certain cash and non cash  non recurring items  and  because such non recurring items can  at times  affect our operating results  the exclusion of such items is a material limitation 
we present ccf because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our performance and believe it is frequently used by our investors and other interested parties  as well as by our management  in the evaluation of companies in our industry  many of which present ccf when reporting their results 
in addition  ccf provides additional information used by our management and board of directors to facilitate internal comparisons to historical operating performance of prior periods 
further  management believes that ccf facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period because it excludes potential differences caused by variations in capital structure affecting interest expense  tax positions such as the impact of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment affecting depreciation expense 
we believe that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to ccf applied in presenting accf are appropriate to provide additional information to investors about the performance of the business  and we are required to reconcile net earnings loss to accf to demonstrate compliance with debt covenants 
while the determination of appropriate adjustments in the calculation of accf is subject to interpretation under the terms of the notes  management believes the adjustments described below are in accordance with the covenants in the indentures governing the notes

and subsidiaries management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations december  inflation  trends and general considerations from time to time  we have evaluated and expect to continue to evaluate possible acquisition transactions and the possible dispositions of certain of our businesses  and at any given time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to possible acquisitions or dispositions 
the demand for our products is seasonal  particularly in the northeast and midwest regions of the united states where inclement weather during the winter months usually reduces the level of building and remodeling activity in both the home improvement and new construction markets 
our lower sales levels usually occur during the first and fourth quarters 
since a high percentage of our manufacturing overhead and operating expenses are relatively fixed throughout the year  operating income and net earnings tend to be lower in quarters with lower sales levels 
in addition  the demand for cash to fund the working capital needs of our subsidiaries is greater from late in the first quarter until early in the fourth quarter 
we are subject to the effects of changing prices and the impact of inflation which could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations 
in some circumstances  market conditions or customer expectations may prevent us from increasing the prices of our products to offset the inflationary pressures that may increase costs in the future 
continued strategic sourcing initiatives and other cost reduction measures help mitigate fluctuations in such costs  including commodity and freight costs 
see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations industry overview 
as of december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our workforce was subject to various collective bargaining agreements 
a work stoppage at one of our facilities could cause us to lose sales  incur increased costs and adversely affect our ability to meet customers needs 
a plant shutdown or a substantial modification to a collective bargaining agreement could result in material gains or losses or the recognition of an asset impairment 
as agreements expire and until negotiations are completed  we do not know whether we will be able to negotiate collective bargaining agreements on the same or more favorable terms as the current agreements or at all and without production interruptions  including labor stoppages 
market risk as discussed more specifically below  we are exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates  foreign currencies and commodity pricing 
we do not use derivative financial instruments  except on a limited basis  to periodically mitigate certain economic exposures 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
a 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates primarily through our investing and borrowing activities 
in addition  our ability to finance future acquisition transactions may be impacted if we are unable to obtain appropriate financing at acceptable interest rates 
our investing strategy to manage interest rate exposure is to invest in short term  highly liquid investments and marketable securities 
short term investments primarily consist of federal agency discount notes  treasury bills and bank issued money market instruments with original maturities of days or less 
at december  and  the fair value of our unrestricted and restricted investments and marketable securities was not materially different from their cost basis 
we manage our borrowing exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of fixed rate debt with extended maturities 
at december  and  approximately and  respectively  of the carrying value of our long term debt was at fixed interest rates 
the remaining portion of our long term debt is at variable interest rates 
based upon interest rates in effect at december   an overall unfavorable change in interest rates of basis points would result in an additional charge to interest expense of approximately million

the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to translation resulted in an increase in stockholders investment of approximately million for  a decrease in stockholders investment of approximately million for  and an increase in stockholder investment of approximately million for the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to transactions resulted in a decrease in foreign exchange losses recorded in sg a of approximately million for as compared to and an increase in foreign exchange losses recorded in sg a of approximately million for as compared to we manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk principally by trying to minimize our net investment in foreign assets  including the use of strategic short and long term borrowings at the foreign subsidiary level 
consistent with this strategy  short term bank obligations at december  consist primarily of short term borrowings by certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
at december  and  our net investment in foreign assets was approximately million and million  respectively 
an overall unfavorable change in foreign exchange rates in effect at december  of would result in a reduction in equity as a result of the impact on the cumulative translation adjustment of approximately million

if prices of these raw materials were to increase dramatically  we may not be able to pass such increases on to customers and  as a result  gross margins could decline significantly 
we manage our exposure to commodity pricing risk by continuing to diversify our product mix  strategic buying programs and vendor partnering 
we generally do not enter into derivative financial instruments to manage commodity pricing exposure 
at december  and  we did not have any material outstanding commodity forward contracts
