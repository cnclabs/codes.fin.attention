item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including the risks discussed in item a risk factors  and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition under the percentage of completion method  bad debts  inventories  warranty reserves  investment valuations  valuation of stock compensation awards  recoverability of deferred tax assets  liabilities for uncertain tax positions and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
the prior period amounts have been revised for the impact of discontinued operations due to the expected sale of our iii v product line  including our ktc subsidiary 
our financial results for prior periods have also been revised  in accordance with gaap  to reflect certain changes to the business and other matters 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are most affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue if four basic criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and services rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we do not recognize revenue for products prior to customer acceptance unless we believe the product meets all customer specifications and has a history of consistently achieving customer acceptance of the product 
provisions for product returns and allowances are recorded in the same period as the related revenues 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of product when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and other allowances 
certain product sales are made to distributors under agreements allowing for a limited right of return on unsold products 
sales to distributors are primarily made for sales to the distributors customers and not for stocking of inventory 
we delay revenue recognition for our estimate of distributor claims of right of return on unsold products based upon our historical experience with our products and specific analysis of amounts subject to return based upon discussions with our distributors or their customers 
we recognize revenues from long term research and development contracts on the percentage of completion method of accounting as work is performed  based upon the ratio of costs or hours already incurred to the estimated total cost of completion or hours of work to be performed 
revenue recognized at any point in time is limited to the amount funded by the us government or contracting entity 
we account for product development and research contracts that have established prices for distinct phases as if each phase were a separate contract 
in some instances  we are contracted to create a deliverable which is anticipated to go into full production 
in those cases  we discontinue the percentage of completion method after formal qualification of the deliverable has been completed and revenue is then recognized based on the criteria established for sale of products 
in certain instances qualification may be achieved and delivery of production units may commence however our customer may have either identified new issues to be resolved or wish to incorporate a newer display technology 
in these circumstances new units delivered will continue to be accounted for under the criteria established for sale of products 
we classify amounts earned on contracts in progress that are in excess of amounts billed as unbilled receivables and we classify amounts received in excess of amounts earned as billings in excess of revenues earned 
we invoice based on dates specified in the related agreement or in periodic installments based upon our invoicing cycle 
we recognize the entire amount of an estimated ultimate loss in our financial statements at the time the loss on a contract becomes known 
accounting for design  development and production contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract revenues and costs  and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
due to the size and nature of the work required to be performed on many of our contracts  the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
contract costs include material  labor and subcontracting costs  as well as an allocation of indirect costs 
we have to make assumptions regarding the number of labor hours required to complete a task  the complexity of the work to be performed  the availability and cost of materials  and performance by our subcontractors 
for contract change orders  claims or similar items  we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 
we have accounting policies in place to address these as well as other contractual and business arrangements to properly account for long term contracts 
if our estimate of total contract costs or our determination of whether the customer agrees that a milestone is achieved is incorrect  our revenue could be overstated and profits would be negatively impacted 
bad debt we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this estimate is based on an analysis of specific customer creditworthiness and historical bad debts experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make future payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory we provide a reserve for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventory based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions and our production plans 
inventories that are obsolete or slow moving are generally fully reserved representing the estimated net realizable value as such information becomes available 
our display products are manufactured based upon production plans whose critical assumptions include non binding demand forecasts provided by our customers  lead times for raw materials  lead times for wafer foundries to perform circuit processing and yields 
if a customer were to cancel an order or actual demand was lower than forecasted demand  we may not be able to sell the excess display inventory and additional reserves would be required 
if we were unable to sell the excess inventory  we would establish reserves to reduce the inventory to its estimated realizable value generally zero 
investment valuation at december  we held minority investments in advance wireless semiconductor company awsc and win semiconductor corp 
win  publicly traded companies on the taiwan stock exchange whose share prices have been  and may continue to be  highly volatile 
we consider these investments to be available for sale and accordingly account for fluctuations in the value of these investments in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the fair market values of awsc and win were million and million  respectively  at december  we periodically make equity investments in private companies  accounted for on the cost or equity method  whose values are difficult to determine 
when assessing investments in private companies for an other than temporary decline in value  we consider such factors as  among other things  the share price from the investee latest financing round  the performance of the investee in relation to its own operating targets and its business plan  the investee revenue and cost trends  the liquidity and cash position  including its cash burn rate and market acceptance of the investee products and services 
because these are private companies which we do not control we may not be able to obtain all of the information we would want in order to make a complete assessment of the investment on a timely basis 
accordingly  our estimates may be revised if other information becomes available at a later date 
in addition to the above we make investments in government and agency backed securities and corporate debt securities 
for all of our investments we provide for an impairment valuation if we believe a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary  which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
the determination of whether a decline in value is other than temporary requires that we estimate the cash flows we expect to receive from the security 
we use publicly available information such as credit ratings and financial information of the entity that issued the security in the development of our expectation of the cash flows to be received 
historically  we have periodically recorded other than temporary impairment losses 
product warranty we generally sell products with a limited warranty of product quality and a limited indemnification of customers against intellectual property infringement claims related to our products 
we accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
as of december   we had a warranty reserve of million  which represents the estimated liabilities for warranty claims in process  potential warranty issues customers have notified us about and an estimate based on historical failure rates 
for the fiscal years  and  our warranty claims and reversals were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
if our estimates for warranty claims are incorrect  our profits would be impacted 
income taxes we have historically incurred domestic operating losses from both a financial reporting and tax return standpoint 
we establish valuation allowances if it appears more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
these judgments are based on our projections of taxable income and the amount and timing of our tax operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
given our federal operating tax loss carryforwards  we do not expect to pay domestic federal taxes in the near term 
it is possible that we could pay domestic alternative minimum taxes and state income taxes 
we are also subject to foreign taxes from our korean  taiwan and uk subsidiary operations 
our income tax provision is based on calculations and assumptions that will be subject to examination by tax authorities 
despite our history of operating losses there can be exposures for state taxes  federal alternative minimum taxes or foreign tax that may be due 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
should the actual results differ from our estimates  we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
such adjustment could have a material impact on our results of operations 
we have historically established valuation allowances against all of our net deferred tax assets because of our history of generating operating losses and restrictions on the use of certain items 
our evaluation of the recoverability of deferred tax assets has also included analysis of the expiration dates of net operating loss carryforwards 
in forming our conclusions as to whether the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized we consider the sources of our income and the projected stability of those sources and product life cycles 
over the last three fiscal years a significant component of our income has been derived from sales of higher margin military products to the us government 
if  as expected  the us government significantly reduces funding for these programs our results of operations will be adversely affected 
in assessing our ability to realize our domestic deferred tax assets in the future  we consider the potential impact of the us government federal budget deficit on both the us military programs in which we currently participate and those programs in which we anticipate participating in the future 
a similar analysis is performed with respect to our foreign subsidiaries 
stock compensation there were no stock options granted in fiscal years  or the fair value of nonvested restricted common stock awards is generally the market value of the company equity shares on the date of grant 
the nonvested common stock awards require the employee to fulfill certain obligations  including remaining employed by the company for one  two or four years the vesting period and in certain cases meeting performance criteria 
the performance criteria primarily consist of the achievement of the company annual incentive plan goals 
for nonvested restricted common stock awards which solely require the recipient to remain employed with the company  the stock compensation expense is amortized over the anticipated service period 
for nonvested restricted common stock awards which require the achievement of performance criteria  the company reviews the probability of achieving the performance goals on a periodic basis 
if the company determines that it is probable that the performance criteria will be achieved  the amount of compensation cost derived for the performance goal is amortized over the service period 
if the performance criteria are not met  no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed 
the company recognizes compensation costs on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for time vested awards 
we have an award to the ceo which vests upon our stock price achieving a certain price for consecutive business days 
the compensation expense associated with this award was recognized over the derived service period 
results of operations on january  the closing date  we completed the sale of our iii v product line  including all of the outstanding equity interest in ktc wireless  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company that held our investment in kopin taiwan corporation ktc  to iqe kc  llc iqe and iqe plc parent  and collectively with iqe  the buyer 
our iii v products primarily consisted of our gallium arsenide based hbt transistor wafers and we referred to them as our iii v products because we used elements categorized on the iii and v columns of the periodic table of elements to manufacture such products 
the aggregate purchase price was approximately million  subject to certain adjustments  including working capital adjustments and escrow 
of the total consideration  million was paid to us as of the closing date and million was placed in escrow pending a final determination of adjustments and working capital as of the closing date 
the remaining million will be paid to us on the third anniversary of the closing date 
for the years ended december   december  and december  our iii v revenues were million  million and million  respectively 
we are a leading developer and manufacturer of miniature displays and in increased our software development capabilities with investments in two companies 
we use our proprietary semiconductor material technology to design  manufacture and market our display products for use in highly demanding high resolution portable military  industrial and consumer electronic applications  training and simulation equipment and d metrology equipment 
our products enable our customers to develop and market an improved generation of products for these target applications 
we have two principal sources of revenues product revenues and research and development revenues 
research and development revenues consist primarily of development contracts with agencies or prime contractors of the us government 
research and development revenues were million  or of total revenues  million  or of total revenues and million  or of total revenues 
we manufacture transmissive microdisplays and reflective displays 
in fiscal year the initial manufacturing steps for our commercial transmissive display were performed in our westborough  massachusetts  usa facility and then the back end packaging steps for our commercial transmissive display products were performed at our korean subsidiary  kowon 
if the transmissive display was for a us military application the entire display manufacturing process was performed in our westborough  massachusetts facility 
commencing in both commercial and military transmissive display production will be performed entirely in our westborough  massachusetts facility 
forth dimension displays fdd  our wholly owned subsidiary  manufactures our reflective microdisplays in its facility located in scotland and it is a reportable segment 
because our fiscal year ends on the last saturday of december every seven years we have a fiscal year with weeks 
our fiscal year was a week year as compared to fiscal years which was weeks and which was weeks 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
our revenues  which include product sales and amounts earned from research and development contracts  for fiscal years and  by category  were as follows display revenues by category in millions military applications consumer electronic applications and other eyewear applications research development total sales of our products for military applications declined in because of reduced demand from the us government 
based on recently proposed federal budgets and discussions with our customers  we expect our revenues from sales of defense related products to the us government to decline approximately million to million in our fiscal year 
our military products have higher profit margins than our other display products and have been a significant contributor to our overall profitability for the past several years 
the us government is projected to incur large budget deficits for the near future and is expected to reduce spending on military programs as part of the solution to decrease these deficits 
the decrease in the consumer electronic applications and other category is the result of a decrease in sales of our products for digital still cameras 
our ability to forecast our revenues in this category is very difficult as sales of our product ultimately depend on how successful our customers are in promoting their digital still camera models 
there are many digital still camera models offered by a number of large consumer electronics companies and it is a very competitive product category 
in addition we typically rebid to win this business each year 
the decrease in research and development revenues is the result of a decrease in funding from the us government 
we are unable to predict the amount of funding for research and development by the us government as it addresses its fiscal deficit issues 
in  we began offering a headworn  voice and gesture controlled  hands free cloud computing reference design that has an optical pod with a microdisplay which we refer to as golden i technology 
our plan is to license the golden i technology and sell the optical pod as a group or individually 
the golden i technology encompasses a number of different technologies including but not limited to voice and gesture control  noise cancellation  and web browsing 
some of the technologies included in golden i we license from other companies 
customers may license only a subset of these technologies depending on whether they wish to develop a military  industrial or consumer product 
we have entered into an agreement to license the golden i technology and know how to a company that is developing an industrialized product which they announced in and anticipate offering in the license is exclusive for the industrial market  non exclusive for certain other markets and prohibits sales to other markets 
under the terms of the license we will sell an optical pod which includes our display  optics and a back light 
sales of golden i technology enabled products in and were de minimis and were primarily to demonstrate the product concept 
we do believe in successive years our ability to develop and expand the golden i technologies and to market and license the golden i technology will be important for our revenue growth and ability to achieve profitability 
this is the first product that we have developed that has a significant software component 
the markets the golden i technology can be used in already have a number of existing product offerings such as ruggedized lap top computers and tablets 
the companies that offer these products are significantly larger than we are 
we expect to incur significant development and marketing costs in to commercialize the golden i technologies 
we currently expect revenue of between million and million for fiscal year  however our ability to forecast revenues derived from golden i technology which may significantly impact our results of operations is very limited 
we currently expect to have a consolidated net loss in the range of million to million in we have provided estimated revenue and net loss ranges in order for the investor to understand the impact of both the sale of our iii v product line and expected changes in our remaining business in as compared to however  we believe we have an opportunity to position ourselves in the growing wearable cloud computing market and therefore our primary focus in is on developing technology and products and establish relationships and not necessarily by achieving revenue  net loss or any other particular financial metric 
accordingly our net losses may exceed or current estimates 
there are a number of different display technologies which can produce displays in small form factors 
we believe one of the benefits of our display technology is the ability to produce high resolution displays in small form factors 
the digital still camera market is mature and the majority of these devices use low resolution display products which results in our having limited  if any  competitive advantage over our competitors and  therefore  the ability to sell displays into these markets is very price dependent 
accordingly  for us to maintain or increase display revenues with above average gross margins  we will need to increase sales to customers who buy our higher resolution display products  such as the military  or develop new categories  such as our golden i product 
international sales represented and of product revenues for fiscal years and  respectively 
our international sales are primarily denominated in us currency 
consequently  a strengthening of the us dollar could increase the price in local currencies of our products in foreign markets and make our products relatively more expensive than competitors products that are denominated in local currencies  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in those foreign markets 
in addition  our korean subsidiary  kowon  holds us dollars in order to pay various expenses 
as a result  our financial position and results of operations are subject to exchange rate fluctuation in transactional and functional currency 
we have not taken any protective measures against exchange rate fluctuations  such as purchasing hedging instruments with respect to such fluctuations  because of the historically stable exchange rate between the japanese yen  korean won and the us dollar 
cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues in millions cost of product revenues as a of revenues cost of product revenues  which is comprised of materials  labor and manufacturing overhead related to the production of our products increased as a percentage of revenues in as compared to due to a decrease in the sale of our display products for military applications  normal price declines and lower unit sales of our display products 
military products historically have higher gross margins than commercial products 
research and development 
research and development r d expenses are incurred in support of internal display development programs or programs funded by agencies or prime contractors of the us government and commercial partners 
in fiscal year our r d expenditures will be related to our display products and golden i technologies 
r d revenues associated with funded programs are presented separately in revenue in the statement of operations 
research and development costs include staffing  purchases of materials and laboratory supplies  circuit design costs  fabrication and packaging of display products  and overhead 
for fiscal years and r d expense was as follows in millions research and development expense funded internal total r d expense decreased in as compared to the prior year primarily because of decreases in government funded display activities and costs to develop display products partially offset by an increase in costs to develop the golden i technologies 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses consist of the expenses incurred by our sales and marketing personnel and related expenses  and administrative and general corporate expenses 
selling  general and administrative expense in millions selling  general and administrative expense as a of revenues the increase in s  g a expenses in as compared to is primarily attributable to additional stock compensation expense 
impairment 
on january   we purchased of the outstanding common stock of fdd for approximately million plus contingent consideration 
in accounting for the acquisition of fdd  we allocated million to identifiable intangible assets and million to goodwill 
the allocations were based on estimated cash flows as of the acquisition date 
during fiscal year the actual operating results and cash flows generated by fdd were less than originally forecasted and at year end  using revised forecasts  we performed our annual review of intangible assets and goodwill 
as a result of this review we recorded a non cash charge of million to write down the carrying value of the intangible assets and the goodwill to its implied fair market value based on projected discounted cash flows 
the impairment of goodwill represented a decrease in its recorded value 
as of june   we performed an interim impairment analysis of our finite lived intangible assets and goodwill balance related to fdd  as fdd actual results were less than originally forecast for the six month period then ended 
we performed our analysis of our finite lived intangible assets based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the recorded carrying value of the intangible assets 
as a result  there was no change in the carrying values of the finite lived intangible assets  however  we recorded a non cash charge of million to write down the remaining carrying value of the goodwill to zero 
no additional impairments were taken in fdd produces a very high resolution micro display for niche markets 
the majority of its current and forecasted revenues are derived from a small group of customers less than 
in addition approximately of fdd forecasted sales over the next years are dependent on relatively new customers 
if fdd loses any of its significant customers  or the products which it is projecting to provide significant revenue in the future fail to meet expectations and are not complemented by other revenue sources  additional impairment charges may be necessary

for  we recorded million of foreign currency losses as compared to foreign currency gains for this was primarily attributable to increased fluctuations in the us dollar and korean won currency exchange rate 
other income and expense  net for also includes expense of million to record an impairment of certain marketable debt securities which were deemed other than temporarily impaired 
as our marketable debt securities have matured we have been reinvesting in securities which  due to current interest rates  have lower yields than the securities which matured 
accordingly we anticipate that our interest income will decline in we have entered into agreements to sell certain patents which we were not using 
the total consideration the company receives for the sale of the patents is a percentage of any sublicense fees  after expenses  the buyer receives 
under the agreements  in we sold patents that had a carrying value of for million 
there is no additional consideration to be received for the patents sold 
we continue to evaluate the patents in our portfolio for opportunities to monetize these assets 
equity losses in unconsolidated affiliates 
our equity losses in unconsolidated affiliates in consists of our approximate share of the losses of kobrite totaling million  and our share of the losses of ikanos totaling million 
in july of we increased our investment in ikanos to and commenced consolidating ikanos results of operations into or results of operations 
our equity losses in unconsolidated affiliates in consist of our approximate share of the losses of kobrite totaling million 
tax provision 
the provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended of million represents withholding taxes related to closing our korean facilities 
for we expect to have taxes based on us federal tax liabilities on federal alternative minimum tax rules and on our foreign operations 
we also expect to have a state tax provision in net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest 
during the three month period ended march  we acquired a interest in ikanos  for million and in the three month period ended september   we purchased from ikanos an additional  newly issued shares of its common stock for approximately million 
as a result of these transactions we own approximately of the outstanding common stock of ikanos 
the remaining is held by other investors and employees of ikanos 
we also own approximately of the equity of kowon as of december  net loss income attributable to the noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statement of operations represents the portion of the results of operations of kowon and ikanos which are allocated to the shareholders of the approximately of kowon and of ikanos not owned by us 
the change in the net income loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest of our subsidiaries is as follows in millions kowon ikanos total fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues

the us government is projected to incur large budget deficits for the near future and is expected to reduce spending on military programs as part of the solution to decrease these deficits 
in addition an anticipated overall decline in military spending our military revenues may also decline because of a change in the us government procurement process 
we believe the us military will evaluate competitors products for the next thermal weapon sight program 
this could result in our receiving a lower percentage of these total programs than we have historically and while we do not believe it is probable  it is possible we may not receive any award 
the increase in the consumer electronic applications category is the result of an increase in sales of our products for digital still cameras 
our ability to forecast our revenues in this category is very difficult as sales of our product ultimately depend on how successful our customers are in promoting their digital still cameras models 
there are many digital still camera models offered by a number of large consumer electronics companies and it is a very competitive product category 
in addition we typically rebid to win this business each year 
the customers for our eyewear products tend to be smaller companies and the economic down turn during the recent years has affected their ability to obtain credit with which to purchase our products 
the increase in research and development revenues is the result of an increase in funding from the us government 
we are unable to predict the amount of funding for research and development by the us government as it addresses its fiscal deficit issues 
in  we began offering a headworn  hands free cloud computing product that has an optical pod with a microdisplay which we refer to as golden i

in addition  sales of our cyberdisplay products in korea are transacted through our korean subsidiary  kowon technology co  ltd 
kowon sales are primarily denominated in us dollars 
however  kowon local operating costs are primarily denominated in korean won 
kowon also holds us dollars in order to pay various expenses

our gross margin is affected by increases or decreases in the sales prices of our products  changes in raw material prices  unit volume of sales  manufacturing efficiencies and the mix of products sold 
as discussed above our sales prices historically decline on an annual basis 
our overhead costs and  to a lesser extent  our labor costs are normally stable and do not fluctuate significantly during any twelve month period 
we consider labor and overhead costs to be fixed in nature over the short term and therefore profitability is very dependent on the sales prices of our products and the volume of sales 
gross margins  as a percentage of sales  increased from to because of the increase in sales in by fdd  which has a higher gross margin as a percentage than our consolidated gross margin percentage

the number of shares of our common stock that an employee will ultimately receive and the compensation expense that we will ultimately recognize under an incentive equity award is based on achieving certain financial milestones and or remaining with the company for a specific period of time 
in the case of retention equity awards  shares earned are solely a function of time employed 
we filed a proxy statement on march  describing our equity incentive plan  and we have also filed on behalf of certain officers and directors form s with the securities and exchange commission which detail the conditions under which our officers can earn the restricted stock awards
