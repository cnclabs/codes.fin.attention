overview we are a development stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the rapid development of therapies to treat prevalent inflammatory conditions for which there are limited treatment options 
we are focused on providing medicines to improve the health and quality of life of patients with minimal side effects 
we are developing compounds that decrease inflammation by i inhibition of specific pro inflammatory compounds by affecting specific pathways at the protein expression and at the transcription level or ii activation of a specific phosphatase or depletion of the available phosphate needed for the inflammation process 
we are also focused on monetizing our sexual dysfunction portfolio and a diagnostic device 
financing activities on september  ampio filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission sec to register ampio common stock and warrants in an aggregate amount of up to million for offering from time to time in the future 
the registration statement also registers for possible resale up to one million shares of common stock to be sold by directors and management as selling shareholders in future public offerings 
on october  ampio filed an amendment to identify potential selling stockholders and the number of shares they would be eligible to sell in the event of a future public offering 
the shelf registration was declared effective on october  by the sec 
at december  ampio had million available for future public offerings along with  shares remaining for future sale by named selling shareholders 
in july ampio completed an underwritten public offering for the sale of  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
gross proceeds to ampio were  with net proceeds of  after underwriter fees and cash offering expenses 
ampio also issued warrants to purchase  shares of common stock to the underwriters 
these warrants have an exercise price of and can be exercised from the period july  through july  certain shareholders also became selling shareholders and received gross proceeds of  from the offering of  shares as provided in the registration statement 
the net proceeds of the offering have been or will be used for general corporate purposes and working capital  including completion of the ampion and optina clinical trials and costs related to the regulatory approval and commercialization of zertane 
management update on december   ampio entered into an employment agreement with joshua r 
disbrow to serve as the chief operating officer coo 
effective january   at the request of donald b 
wingerter  jr  chief executive officer ceo  ampio granted a compassionate leave to him from all his duties as ceo  member of the board of directors and as an employee 
ampio s chairman of the board  michael macaluso  was appointed ceo concurrent with mr 
wingerter s departure 
known trends or future events  outlook we have not generated any significant revenues and have therefore incurred significant net losses totaling million since our inception in december the assets we purchased from biosciences in april generated minimal revenues prior to their acquisition 
we expect to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future  but intend to try to limit the extent of these losses by entering into co development or collaboration agreements with one or more strategic partners 
although we have raised capital in the past and raised net proceeds of million and million through the sale of common stock in and  respectively  we cannot assure you that we will be able to secure such additional financing  if needed  or that it will be adequate to execute our business strategy 
even if we obtain additional financing  it may be costly and may require us to agree to covenants or other provisions that will favor new investors over existing shareholders 

table of contents our primary focus is advancing the clinical development of our core assets ampion and optina 
we have filed the proposed protocol for the upcoming ampion study based on the new guidance received by the fda in february with the fda and are waiting for their response 
we have previously announced the initiation of a b clinical trial of optina in diabetic macular edema 
these trials will be blinded and conducted by third party clinical research organizations and we have announced that the costs associated with these contracts will be million for the optina trial and less than million for the ampion trial 
in addition  we are involved in active discussions with other parties regarding potential licensing  marketing  and distribution opportunities worldwide as well as an outright asset purchase of the sexual dysfunction portfolio 
luoxis diagnostics  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary  focused on commercialization of orp is currently seeking private financing 
we are also sponsoring the pre clinical development of nce and hope to file an ind with the fda by the end of in order to pursue clinical development of this product candidate for the treatment of cancer 
vasaloc  another one of our product candidates whose formulation is the same as optina  for diabetic nephropathy will be evaluated for clinical development after completion and evaluation of the optina trial 
at this time  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trials and the stage of development of our product candidates  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the additional costs we will incur for the continued development of our product candidates for commercialization as clinical development timelines  probability of success  and development costs vary widely 
we are also focused on monetizing several of our other assets our sexual dysfunction portfolio  orp  and copper chelating peptides 
however  we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which product candidates will be subject to future collaborative or licensing arrangements  when such arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our product candidate plans and capital requirements 
significant accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to recoverability of long lived assets  fair value of our derivative instruments  allowances and contingencies 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the methods  estimates  and judgments used by us in applying these most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements 
patents costs of establishing patents consisting of legal fees paid to third parties and related costs are currently expensed as incurred 
we will continue this practice unless we can demonstrate that such costs add economic value to our business  in which case we will capitalize such costs as part of intangible assets 
the primary consideration in making this determination is whether or not we can demonstrate that such costs have  in fact  increased the economic value of our intellectual property 
legal and related costs which do not meet the above criteria will be expensed as incurred 
the  fair value of the zertane patents acquired in connection with the march acquisition of biosciences is being amortized over the remaining us patent lives of approximately years beginning april in process research and development in process research and development iprd relates to the zertane product and clinical trial data acquired in connection with the march business combination of biosciences 
the  recorded was based on an independent third party appraisal of the fair value of the assets acquired 
iprd is considered an indefinite lived intangible asset and its fair value will be assessed for impairment annually and written down if impaired 
once the zertane product obtains regulatory approval and commercial production begins  iprd will be amortized over its estimated useful life 
if the commercialization of zertane becomes impracticable or we abandon this drug  we will expense the million iprd asset 
product technology license ampio acquired a product technology license for an orally disintegrating table odt formulation for zertane 
the million license asset purchase was expensed since the odt formulation has not been petitioned for regulatory approval and the license does not have an alternative future use 
research and development research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
these costs consist primarily of expenses for personnel engaged in the design and development of product candidates  the scientific research necessary to produce commercially viable applications of our proprietary drugs or compounds  early stage clinical testing of product candidates or compounds  expenditures for design and engineering of the orp product  and development equipment and supplies  facilities costs and other related overhead 

table of contents stock based compensation we account for stock based payments by recognizing compensation expense based upon the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant 
we determine the estimated grant fair value of options using the black scholes option pricing model and recognize compensation costs ratably over the vesting period using the straight line method 
common stock issued in exchange for services is recorded at the fair value of the common stock at the date at which we become obligated to issue the shares 
the value of the shares is expensed over the requisite service period 
derivatives we account for hybrid financial instruments debentures with embedded derivative features conversion options  down round protection and a mandatory conversion provision and related warrants by recording the fair value of each hybrid instrument in its entirety and recording the fair value of the warrant derivative liability 
the fair value of the hybrid financial instruments and warrants was calculated using a binomial lattice based valuation model 
we recorded a derivative expense at the inception of each instrument reflecting the difference between the fair value and cash received 
changes in the fair value in subsequent periods were recorded as unrealized gain or loss on fair value of derivative instruments for the hybrid financial instruments and to derivative income or expense for the warrants 
income taxes we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we recognize deferred assets and liabilities based on the differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years 
we establish a valuation allowance for all deferred tax assets for which there is uncertainty regarding realization 
results of operations year ended december   and see notes to consolidated financial statements

these losses include non cash charges related to depreciation and amortization expense  derivative expense  stock based compensation and losses on the fair value of debt instruments in the amount of million in  million in and million in revenue we are a development stage enterprise and have not generated material revenue in our operating history 
the  and  license revenue recognized in and  respectively  represents the amortization of the upfront payment received on our license agreement 
the initial payment of  from the license agreement with a korean pharmaceutical company was deferred and being recognized over years 

table of contents expenses research and development research and development costs consist of labor  research and development of patents and intellectual property  stock based compensation as well as drug development and clinical trials 
these costs are summarized as follows year ended december  labor patent costs stock based compensation clinical trials and sponsored research technology license consultants comparison of years ended december  and research and development expenses increased approximately in over this was due primarily to costs associated with fda pre ind filings for our three major drug candidates  the ind submissions for ampion and optina  and clinical trials of ampion and optina 
we also incurred costs related to the production of the study drugs for the ampion and optina trials 
we continue to maintain and strengthen our patent portfolio while labor and stock compensation costs were relatively flat 
these represent costs solely related to research and development without an allocation of general and administrative expenses 
comparison of years ended december  and research and development expenses increased approximately in over as we refocused from building our corporate foundation to the corporate objective of research and development of drug candidates 
the increase in expenses in relates to our primary product candidates as we began ampion and optina clinical trials early in and acquired a  product technology license related to our zertane product 
we also continued to maintain and strengthen our patent portfolio on our primary product candidates 
labor costs increased as a result of several employees having job responsibilities change from administrative to research and development 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs for employees in executive  business development and operational functions  professional fees including legal  auditing and accounting  occupancy  travel and other including rent  governmental and regulatory compliance  and outside director fees 
these costs are summarized as follows year ended december  labor stock based compensation professional fees occupancy  travel and other directors fees    comparison of years ended december  and there was an overall decrease of approximately in general and administrative costs in from labor costs increased in as the result of the employment agreement payout to our former ceo upon the granting of an indefinite compassionate leave of absence in january stock based compensation decreased in due to longer vesting periods being incorporated into new awards  resulting in straight line amortization of the fair value over a longer period 
professional fees consist primarily of legal  audit 
table of contents and accounting costs  costs related to the chay enterprises merger  public company compliance costs  and consulting related to capital formation 
professional fees decreased in as compared to since we had only routine filing and reporting requirements in in we had additional professional fees related to the filing of a form s with the sec and the acquisition of biosciences 
travel and investor public relations costs increased in as we pursued business development and financing opportunities 
directors fees decreased because only regularly scheduled meetings were held during  compared to when additional meetings were required 
no general and administrative costs are currently being allocated to the research and development activities 
comparison of years ended december  and general and administrative expenses decreased by in from the expenses 
labor costs increased in over as we added new positions and transitioned from consultants to employees as workloads necessitated 
stock based compensation decreased 
expansion of operations resulted in an increase of occupancy  travel and other costs increase in the director fees resulted from the adoption of a compensation plan for independent directors in august with the acceleration of research and development  job responsibilities of several existing employees changed from administrative functions so that the costs associated with those employees were more appropriately allocated to research and development beginning april  derivative expense we recorded approximately  million and million in non cash derivative income expense in  and  respectively  in connection with our hybrid financial instruments consisting of debentures and related warrants 
the expense relates to the fair value at inception and subsequent changes in fair value of the debentures issued in and stemming from the embedded derivative features conversion options  down round protection and mandatory conversion provisions and the changes in fair value of warrants issued in conjunction with the debentures 
the debentures were redeemed in and any related unexercised warrants will expire on december  unrealized loss on fair value of debt instruments we recorded million in non cash unrealized loss on fair value of debt instruments in the first quarter of and  of non cash unrealized gain in the expense reflects the change in fair value of our debentures prior to their conversion to common stock in february and stemmed primarily from the increase in our common stock price between december  and february   when the debentures were converted

net cash used in operating activities also included a  increase in prepaid expenses and cash provided by a  increase in accounts payable

liquidity and capital resources as a development stage biopharmaceutical company  we have not generated significant revenue as our primary activities are focused on research and development  advancing our primary product candidates  and raising capital 
as of december   we had cash 
table of contents and cash equivalents totaling million available to fund our operations and million in payables 
based upon our current expectations  we believe our capital resources at december  will be sufficient to fund our currently planned operations for the next months 
this estimate is based on a number of assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could exhaust our available cash and cash equivalents earlier than presently anticipated 
we may be required or choose to seek additional capital within the next months to expand our clinical development activities for ampion tm and optina tm based on the positive results of our ongoing clinical trials to fund costs of planning for a commercial launch of ampion tm or optina tm  if we face challenges or delays in connection with our clinical trials  or to maintain minimum cash balances that we deem reasonable and prudent 
in addition  we intend to evaluate the capital markets from time to time to determine whether to raise additional capital in the form of equity  convertible debt or otherwise  depending on market conditions relative to our need for funds at such time  and we may seek to raise additional capital within the next months should we conclude that such capital is available on terms that we consider to be in the best interests of us and our stockholders 
we have prepared a budget for which reflects cash requirements for fixed  on going expenses such as payroll  legal and accounting  patents and overhead at an average cash burn rate of between  and  per month 
additional funds in the amount of approximately million are planned for regulatory approvals  completion of clinical trials  and planning for commercialization of zertane during to the extent we decide to further expand our clinical trials  it will be necessary to raise additional capital and or enter into licensing or collaboration agreements 
at this time  we expect to satisfy our future cash needs through private or public sales of our securities or debt financings 
we cannot be certain that financing will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
over the last two years  volatility in the financial markets has adversely affected the market capitalizations of many pharmaceutical companies and generally made equity and debt financing more difficult to obtain 
this volatility  coupled with other factors  may limit our access to additional financing 
if we cannot raise adequate additional capital in the future when we require it  we will be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or our commercialization efforts 
we also may be required to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose 
this may lead to impairment or other charges  which could materially affect our balance sheet and operating results 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have off balance sheet arrangements  financings  or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons  also known as variable interest entities 
recently issued accounting pronouncements new accounting pronouncements to be adopted in july  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the guidance is intended to simplify impairment testing of indefinite lived intangible assets such as iprd by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an asset is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test 
the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 
this guidance is effective for annual and interim tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in may   the fasb issued asu fair value measurement topic the guidance is designed to achieve fair value measurement and disclosure requirements between us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
the amendments were effective for ampio beginning in the first quarter of the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on ampio s consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation in general  we believe that  as a development stage company  our operating expenses can be negatively impacted by increases in the cost of clinical trials due to inflation and rising health care costs
