critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the 
table of contents accompanying financial statements and related notes 
management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience  observance of industry trends and various other sources of information and factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
revenue recognition resident and health care revenue is recognized at estimated net realizable amounts  based on historical experiences  due from residents in the period to which the rental and other services are provided 
revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs accounted for approximately of the company s revenue in each of fiscal   and as of december   of the company s communities are providers of services under medicaid programs 
accordingly  the communities are entitled to reimbursement under the foregoing program at established rates that are lower than private pay rates 
patient service revenue for medicaid patients is recorded at the reimbursement rates as the rates are set prospectively by the state upon the filing of an annual cost report 
two of the company s communities are providers of services under the medicare program and are entitled to payment under the program in amounts determined based on rates established by the federal government 
laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation 
the company believes that it is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and is not aware of any pending or threatened investigations involving allegations of potential wrongdoing 
while no such regulatory inquiries have been made  compliance with such laws and regulations can be subject to future government review and interpretation as well as significant regulatory action including fines  penalties  and exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs

community reimbursement revenue is comprised of reimbursable expenses from non consolidated communities that the company operates under long term management agreements 
credit risk and allowance for doubtful accounts the company s resident receivables are generally due within days 
accounts receivable are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts  and represent the company s estimate of the amount that ultimately will be collected 
the adequacy of the company s allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on an ongoing basis  using historical payment trends  write off experience  analyses of receivable portfolios by payor source and aging of receivables  as well as a review of specific accounts  and adjustments are made to the allowance as necessary 
credit losses on resident receivables have historically been within management s estimates  and management believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts adequately provides for expected losses

the company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance for workers compensation 
determining the reserve for workers compensation losses and costs that the company has incurred as of the end of a reporting period involves significant judgments based on projected future events including potential settlements for pending claims  known incidents which may result in claims  estimates of incurred but not yet reported claims  changes in insurance premiums  estimated litigation costs and other factors 
the company regularly adjusts these estimates to reflect changes in the foregoing factors 
however  since this reserve is based on estimates  the actual expenses incurred may differ from the amounts reserved

table of contents long lived assets property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
at each balance sheet date  the company reviews the carrying value of its property and equipment to determine if facts and circumstances suggest that they may be impaired or that the depreciation period may need to be changed 
the company considers internal factors such as net operating losses along with external factors relating to each asset  including contract changes  local market developments  and other publicly available information 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair market value  generally based on discounted cash flows  of the long lived asset 
the company analyzed certain long lived assets with operating losses  under the undiscounted cash flow method  for impairment 
based on this analysis  the company does not believe there are any indicators that would require an adjustment to the carrying value of the property and equipment or their remaining useful lives as of december  and income taxes at december   the company had recorded on its consolidated balance sheet net deferred tax assets of approximately million
