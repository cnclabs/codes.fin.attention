garmin s fiscal year is a week period ending on the last saturday of the calendar year 
fiscal year and contained weeks compared to weeks for unless otherwise stated  all years and dates refer to the company s fiscal year and fiscal periods 
unless the context otherwise requires  references in this document to we  us  our and similar terms refer to garmin ltd 
and its subsidiaries 
unless otherwise indicated  dollar amounts set forth in the tables are in thousands  except per share data 
overview we are a leading worldwide provider of navigation  communications and information devices  most of which are enabled by global positioning system  or gps  technology 
we operate in five business segments  which serve the marine  outdoor  fitness  automotive mobile  and aviation markets 
our segments offer products through our network of subsidiary distributors and independent dealers and distributors 
however  the nature of products and types of customers for the five segments can vary significantly 
as such  the segments are managed separately 
our portable gps receivers and accessories for marine  outdoor  fitness and automotive mobile segments are sold primarily to retail outlets 
our aviation products are portable and panel mount avionics for visual flight rules and instrument flight rules navigation and are sold primarily to retail outlets and certain aircraft manufacturers 
since our first products were delivered in  we have generated positive income from operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits 
we experience some foreign currency fluctuations in our operating results 
foreign currency gains and losses for the company are primarily tied to movements by the taiwan dollar  the euro  and the british pound sterling 
the taiwan dollar is the functional currency of garmin corporation 
the us dollar remains the functional currency of garmin europe 
the euro is the functional currency of most european subsidiaries 
as these entities have grown  currency moves can generate material gains and losses 
additionally  euro based inter company transactions in garmin ltd 
can also generate currency gains and losses 
other legal entities primarily use the local currency as the functional currency 
due to the relative size of entities using a functional currency other than the taiwan dollar  the euro and the british pound sterling  currency fluctuations within these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
approximately of sales by our european subsidiaries are now denominated in british pounds sterling or the euro 
we experienced million  million  and million in foreign currency losses during fiscal years   and  respectively 
to date  we have not entered into hedging transactions related to any currency  and we do not currently plan to utilize hedging transactions in the future 
critical accounting policies and estimates general garmin s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon garmin s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the presentation of these financial statements requires garmin to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  garmin evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer sales programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  and contingencies and litigation 
garmin bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition garmin recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
for the large majority of garmin s sales  these criteria are met once product has shipped and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products and software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for standalone sales of software products and sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware 
the company generally does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales 
garmin introduced n maps lifetime in january  which is a single fee program that  subject to the program s terms and conditions  enables customers to download the latest map and point of interest information every quarter for the useful life of their pnd 
the revenue and associated cost of royalties for sales of n maps lifetime products are deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the estimated month life of the products 
with the acquisition of navigon ag in  products marketed under the navigon brand have a freshmaps program that enables customers to download the latest map and point of interest information for two years 
the revenue and associated cost of royalties for sales of freshmaps products are deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the two year period 
for multiple element arrangements that include tangible products that contain software essential to the tangible product s functionality and undelivered software elements that relate to the tangible product s essential software  the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices 
in such circumstances  the accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe  ii third party evidence of selling price tpe  and iii best estimate of the selling price esp 
vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately  on more than a limited basis  at prices within a relatively narrow range 
in addition to the products listed below  the company has offered certain other products including mobile applications  aviation subscriptions and extended warranties that involve multiple element arrangements that are immaterial 
in  garmin began offering pnds with lifetime map updates lmus bundled in the original purchase price 
similar to n maps lifetime  lmus enable customers to download the latest map and point of interest information every quarter for the useful life of their pnd 
in addition  garmin offers pnds with premium traffic service bundled in the original purchase price in the european market 
the company has identified two deliverables contained in arrangements involving the sale of pnds which include either the lmu or premium traffic service 
the first deliverable is the hardware along with the software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale 
the second deliverable is either the lmu or premium traffic service 
the company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method 
amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met 
the revenue and associated cost of royalties allocated to the lmu or the subscription for premium traffic service are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated month life of the products 
prior to the third quarter of fiscal  garmin determined its estimate of selling price using the dealer distributor price for n maps lifetime or premium traffic subscriptions sold separately  and the prices for products bundled with and without the lmu and premium traffic service when comparable models were available  as inputs to the relative selling price method in a manner similar to vsoe 
the estimated selling price determined in this manner was used to defer revenues for all products bundled with the lmu and premium traffic service  as the number of bundled units sold as a percentage of total units sold was less significant and other indicators of selling price were not readily available 
during  sales of products bundled with lmus and premium traffic service increased significantly as a percentage of total product sales 
concurrently  market conditions caused decreases in the asp and margins of comparable models year over year  new bundled products were introduced at lower asps  and the difference in pricing of bundled units and comparable unbundled models decreased considerably 
due to these changes  the company determined it was appropriate to change its estimate of the per unit revenue and cost deferrals during the third quarter of as the sales of n maps lifetime and premium traffic subscriptions as a percentage of total unit sales or in the aggregate decreased significantly in mid  the company determined that the previous estimate of selling price based on more limited stand alone sales of n maps lifetime or premium traffic was no longer a sole determinant of its value as determined under vsoe  and that third party evidence of selling price was not available 
management determined that the price differential between bundled and unbundled products and the royalty cost of the lmu or premium traffic subscription plus an approximate margin were both additional indicators of estimated selling price 
these estimates are also reflective of how the company establishes product pricing based in part on customer perception of value of the added lmu or premium traffic service capability 
as such  beginning in the third quarter of  the company changed its estimate of selling price of the undelivered element to be based on the relative selling price method using a weighted average of the stand alone sales price  the price differential between bundled and unbundled units  and the royalty or subscription cost plus a normal margin 
the impact in of the change in estimate for lifetime map updates and premium traffic service  as described above  was an increase in revenue  gross profit  net income  basic net income per share  and diluted net income per share of million  million  million   and  respectively 
garmin records estimated reductions to revenue for customer sales programs  returns and incentive offerings including rebates  price protection product discounts offered to retailers to assist in clearing older products from their inventories in advance of new product releases  promotions and other volume based incentives 
the reductions to revenue are based on estimates and judgments using historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
changes in these estimates could negatively affect garmin s operating results 
these incentives are reviewed periodically and  with the exceptions of price protection and certain other promotions  are accrued for on a percentage of sales basis 
if market conditions were to decline  garmin may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
the company records revenue net of sales tax  trade discounts and customer returns 
the reductions to revenue for expected future product returns are based on garmin s historical experience 
trade accounts receivable we sell our products to retailers  wholesalers  and other customers and extend credit based on our evaluation of each customer s financial condition 
potential losses on receivables are dependent on each individual customer s financial condition 
we carry our trade accounts receivable at net realizable value 
typically  our accounts receivable are collected within days and do not bear interest 
we monitor our exposure to losses on receivables and maintain allowances for potential losses or adjustments 
we determine these allowances by evaluating the aging of our receivables  and reviewing our high risk customers 
past due receivable balances are written off when our internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful 
in  garmin purchased credit insurance to provide security against large losses 
warranties garmin s products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from one to two years 
garmin accrues a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
garmin s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent garmin experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  its warranty accrual will increase  resulting in decreased gross profit 
inventory garmin writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
investments investments are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value  and unrealized investment gains and losses are reflected in stockholders equity 
investment income is recorded when earned  and gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold 
investments are reviewed periodically to determine if they have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other than temporary 
if investments are determined to be impaired  a loss is recognized at the date of determination 
testing for impairment of investments requires significant management judgment 
the identification of potentially impaired investments  the determination of their fair value and the assessment of whether any decline in value is other than temporary are the key judgment elements 
the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments 
revisions of impairment judgments are made when new information becomes known  and any resulting impairment adjustments are made at that time 
the economic environment and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment 
investments are discussed in detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes garmin provides deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes as measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
it is garmin s policy to record a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to an amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
while garmin has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event garmin were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination is made 
likewise  should garmin determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves not to be required  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
stock based compensation garmin awards stock options  stock appreciation rights sars  restricted stock units rsus and or performance shares each year as part of garmin s compensation package for employees 
certain employees within garmin are eligible for stock options  sar grants  rsu grants and or performance shares but the granting of options  sars  rsus and or performance shares is at the discretion of the compensation committee of the board of directors and is not a contractual obligation 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating expected life  forfeitures and dividends 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense could be impacted 
stock compensation plans are discussed in detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounting terms and characteristics net sales our net sales are primarily generated through sales to our global dealer and distributor network and to original equipment manufacturers 
refer to the revenue recognition discussion above 
our sales are largely of a consumer nature  therefore  backlog levels are not necessarily indicative of our future sales results 
we aim to achieve a quick turnaround on orders we receive  and we typically ship most orders within hours 
net sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation 
typically  sales of our consumer products are highest in the second quarter  due to increased demand during the spring and summer season  and in the fourth quarter  due to increased demand during the holiday buying season 
our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation  but are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest 
cost of sales gross profit raw material costs are our most significant component of cost of goods sold 
in  gross margin for our automotive mobile segment increased basis points driven primarily by the amortization of previously deferred high margin revenues  the third quarter change in estimate of per unit revenue and cost deferred as previously discussed and a one time royalty fee adjustment 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on gross profit deferrals 
in  gross margin for our automotive mobile segment declined basis points driven primarily by the deferral of high margin revenue associated with bundled products  partially offset by the change in estimate mentioned above  and decreased selling prices on comparable units  as well as positive impact to gross margin from a refinement in the estimated warranty reserve 
the substantial increase in product mix toward products bundled with lifetime maps required us to defer greater amounts of revenue and related costs than in the prior year  thereby lowering gross profit by million in compared to million for the prior year 
in  gross margin for our automotive mobile segment declined basis points as the average selling price declines outpaced raw material price declines 
in addition  the deferral of high margin revenue and the related costs increased significantly as the product mix began to be impacted by a shift toward products bundled with lifetime maps 
this was partially offset by a positive refinement in the estimated warranty reserve 
in  we experienced a and basis point increase in aviation and fitness gross margins  respectively 
aviation gross margin expansion was driven primarily by product mix and a oem program contribution that negatively impacted gross margins in fitness gross margin improvement was due to product mix 
in  we experienced a basis point decline in marine gross margin due to a shift in product mix 
gross margins for the aviation  marine  outdoor  and fitness segments are typically more stable than in the automotive mobile segment 
our long term gross margin targets are    and  respectively  for these segments 
our existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products in house has enabled us to source components from different suppliers and  where possible  to redesign our products to leverage lower cost components 
we believe that our flexible production model allows our sijhih  jhongli  and linkou manufacturing plants in taiwan  our olathe  kansas  and salem  oregon manufacturing plants to experience relatively low costs of manufacturing 
in general  products manufactured in taiwan have been our highest volume products 
our manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in taiwan than in olathe and salem 
sales price variability has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross profit 
in the past  prices of our devices sold into the automotive mobile market have declined due to market pressures and introduction of new products sold at lower price points 
the average selling prices of our aviation  outdoor  fitness  and marine products have been stable due to product mix and the introduction of more advanced products sold at higher prices 
the effect of the sales price differences inherent within the mix of gps enabled products sold could have a significant impact on our gross profit 
advertising expense our advertising expenses consist of costs for both media advertising and cooperative advertising with our retail partners 
in both and  we reduced our advertising expense as revenues declined and the public became more aware of gps technology 
in  our advertising costs increased slightly as we again experienced revenue growth 
we expect advertising costs to decrease slightly in but to remain consistent as a percentage of net sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries for sales and marketing personnel  salaries and related costs for executives and administrative personnel  marketing  and other brand building costs  accounting and legal costs  information systems and infrastructure costs  travel and related costs  and occupancy and other overhead costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in  and the increase was primarily driven by full year expenses associated with acquisitions completed in the second half of and legal costs 
the increase was primarily driven by acquisitions  commissions associated with a new web based sales program  bad debt expense  legal costs and product support costs 
the increase was primarily due to legal costs  fees associated with the swiss redomestication  and growth in product support and information technology to support our growing installed base of users 
we expect selling  general and administrative costs  excluding advertising  to be stable in research and development the majority of our research and development costs represent salaries for our engineers  costs for high technology components and costs of test equipment used in product and prototype development 
approximately of the research and development of our products is performed in north america 
we are committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer and aviation markets as well as new markets for gps enabled devices 
we expect our research and development budget to increase in due to our ongoing commitment to innovation and growth 
customers our top ten customers have contributed between and of net sales since we have experienced average sales days in our customer accounts receivable of between and days since we experienced an increase in the level of customer accounts receivable days in due to changes in product mix  longer payment terms  and macroeconomic conditions but this was reduced in we expect the level of customer accounts receivable days to be relatively stable in income taxes we have experienced a relatively low effective corporate tax rate due to the proportion of our revenue generated by entities in tax jurisdictions with low statutory rates 
in particular  the profit entitlement afforded our swiss based companies based on their intellectual property rights ownership of our consumer products along with substantial tax incentives offered by the taiwanese government on certain high technology capital investments have continued to reduce our tax rate 
as a result  our consolidated effective tax rate was approximately during this is an increase from an effective rate of in the lower effective tax rate in was primarily driven by the release of reserves related to the expiration of certain statutes of limitations for garmin europe 
this was partially offset by the release of income tax reserves due to the expiration of a statute of limitations in taiwan during we have taken advantage of the tax benefit in taiwan since our inception and we expect to continue to benefit from lower effective tax rates at least through management believes that due to lower operating margins predicted for fiscal  there may be less revenue recognized by entities in lower tax rate jurisdictions 
therefore  the effective tax rate for fiscal is expected to be higher than fiscal the actual effective tax rate will be dependent upon the operating margins  production volume  additional capital investments made during fiscal  the resolution of uncertain tax positions and the composition of our earnings

the decrease was driven by automotive mobile and marine with offsetting growth in outdoor  fitness and aviation 
the outdoor segment experienced the greatest increase at with fitness contributing growth 
automotive mobile revenue remains the largest portion of our revenue mix  but declined from in to in total unit sales decreased to million units in from million units in the declining unit sales volume in was primarily attributable to a decline in automotive mobile units as the north american and european pnd markets slowed due to penetration rates and competing technologies 
this decline was partially offset by increasing volumes in the outdoor and fitness segments  as well as auto oem units 
automotive mobile segment revenue declined in  as the average selling price asp was flat and volumes declined 
asp was stable due to the substantial increase in our bundled product offerings  which include lifetime map updates and premium traffic services  as a percentage of total units sold  offset by a decrease in the asp of comparable models from the previous year 
the increase in product mix toward bundled offerings required us to defer million of net sales in compared to million of net sales in the reduced impact of deferred revenue is related to increased amortization of previously deferred revenues and costs and a reduced per unit revenue deferral rate due to a change in accounting estimate in the third quarter of  as previously discussed  offset by the impact of increased sales of bundled units requiring deferral 
outdoor revenue increased driven by market share gains in the gps enabled golf category and the dog tracking and training portfolio including the benefit of an acquisition completed in the second half of fitness segment revenue increased on the strength of recent product introductions and ongoing global penetration though slowing from growth in the prior year when we had significant promotional activity on discontinued products 
marine revenues decreased due to a difficult international marine environment 
aviation revenues increased as the company s oem business began to recover but was partially offset by declining sales of retrofit and portable products 
the company anticipates revenue of billion in driven by growth in the outdoor  fitness  aviation and marine segments offset by ongoing declines in the automotive mobile segment 
in general  management believes that continuous innovation and the introduction of new products are essential for future revenue growth

the cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues for the automotive mobile segment decreased by basis points 
the decline principally resulted from a million one time royalty fee benefit recorded in second quarter basis points and subsequent impact of reduced royalty costs  a reduction in the year over year impact of deferred revenue and costs including the reduced per unit deferral rate as discussed above basis points  component price reductions and product mix shifting toward more recently introduced products carrying a higher margin profile 
fitness and marine posted declines in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue due to product mix moving toward newer products with increased features  functionality and higher per unit margins  as well as decreased promotional activities 
aviation posted a decline in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue due primarily to product mix and a prior year oem contribution that negatively impacted revenues 
management believes that cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales will decline in given the growth in segments with higher margin profiles than corporate average and current component pricing

interest income for fiscal increased due to increasing cash and marketable securities balances during the year offset by a slight decline in interest rates 
foreign currency gains and losses for the company are primarily tied to movements by the taiwan dollar  the euro  and the british pound sterling 
the taiwan dollar is the functional currency of garmin corporation 
the us dollar remains the functional currency of garmin europe 
the euro is the functional currency of most european subsidiaries 
as these entities have grown  currency moves can generate material gains and losses

due to the relative size of entities using a functional currency other than the taiwan dollar  the euro and the british pound sterling  currency fluctuations within these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
the million currency loss in was due primarily to weakening of the us dollar compared to the taiwan dollar

automotive mobile revenue remains the largest portion of our revenue mix  but declined from in to in total unit sales decreased to million units in from million units in the declining unit sales volume in was attributable to a decline in automotive mobile units as the north american pnd market slowed due to penetration rates and competing technologies partially offset by increasing volumes in the outdoor  fitness  and marine segments 
automotive mobile segment revenue declined in  as the average selling price asp was flat and volumes declined 
asp was stable due to the substantial increase in our bundled product offerings  which include lifetime map updates and premium traffic services  as a percentage of total units sold  offset by a decrease in the asp of comparable models from the previous year 
the increase in product mix toward bundled offerings required us to defer million of net sales in compared to million of net sales in this year over year impact did lessen in the back half of due to a change in accounting estimate 
as bundled products increased significantly as a percentage of total product sales in  including the impact of new product introductions  market conditions also caused decreases in the asp and margins of comparable models year over year 
in addition  the difference in pricing of such bundled units and comparable unbundled models decreased considerably since due to the impact of these and other factors  the company changed its estimate of the per unit revenue and cost deferrals during the third quarter of the impact of the change in estimate was an increase in net sales of million in fitness segment revenue increased on the strength of recent product introductions and ongoing global penetration 
outdoor revenue increased driven by new product introductions and market share gains in the gps enabled golf category

the automotive mobile segment gross profit margin percentage decreased basis points driven primarily by the warranty benefit and the deferral of high margin revenue associated with bundled products 
the substantial increase in product mix toward products bundled with lifetime maps required us to defer greater amounts of revenue and related costs  thereby lowering gross profit by million in the current year compared to million for the prior year 
this year over year impact did lessen in the back half of due to the previously discussed change in accounting estimate 
the impact of the change in estimate was an increase in gross profit of million in outdoor and fitness gross profit margin percentage decreased basis points and basis points  respectively  from the prior year driven primarily by the warranty benefit 
marine gross profit margin percentage decreased basis points driven by the warranty benefit  a increase in warranty reserves to account for geographic mix and a product mix shift toward lower margin products including fishfinders

investing activities fiscal year ended december  december  december  in thousands net cash used in investing activities   the million increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to the following increased investments in marketable securities using cash of million partially offset by decreased cash paid for acquisitions of million the million increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to the following increased investments in marketable securities using cash of million  and increased cash paid for acquisitions including navigon ag  tri tronics inc  and two global distributors of million we have budgeted approximately million of capital expenditures during fiscal to include normal ongoing capital expenditures and maintenance activities 
it is management s goal to invest the on hand cash consistent with garmin s investment policy  which has been approved by the board of directors 
the investment policy s primary purpose is to preserve capital  maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity  and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk 
garmin s average interest rate returns on cash and investments during fiscal   and were approximately   and  respectively 
financing activities fiscal year ended december  december  december  i n thousands net cash used in financing activities   the million decrease in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to the following decreased dividend payments of million due to the timing of our calendar fourth quarter dividend occurring after the close of our fiscal year the million decrease in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to the following decreased treasury stock purchases primarily due to the significant treasury stock transactions associated with our swiss redomestication in  as further discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements our dividend has progressively increased from per share in calendar to per share for the four calendar quarters beginning in june and per share for the four calendar quarters beginning in june we currently use cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures  to support our working capital requirements  and to pay dividends 
we expect that future cash requirements will principally be for capital expenditures  working capital  payment of dividends declared  share repurchases and the funding of strategic acquisitions 
we believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected capital expenditures  working capital and other cash requirements at least through the end of fiscal contractual obligations and commercial commitments future commitments of garmin  as of december   aggregated by type of contractual obligation  are payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases     operating leases describes lease obligations associated with garmin facilities located in the us  taiwan  europe  and canada 
the company is a party to certain commitments  which includes raw materials  advertising and other indirect purchases in connection with conducting our business 
pursuant to these agreements  the company is contractually committed to make purchases of approximately  over the next five years 
we may be required to make significant cash outlays related to unrecognized tax benefits 
however  due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective taxing authorities 
accordingly  unrecognized tax benefits of million as of december   have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
for further information related to unrecognized tax benefits  see note  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market sensitivity we have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials 
product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions 
historically  during cyclical industry downturns  we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures  we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases 
our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the operation of garmin s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates 
we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the us dollar 
the potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations 
the currencies that create a majority of the company s exchange rate exposure are the taiwan dollar  euro  and british pound sterling 
garmin corporation  headquartered in sijhih  taiwan  uses the local currency as the functional currency 
the company translates all assets and liabilities at year end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year 
in order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets  we have elected to retain most of our taiwan subsidiary s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in us dollars 
most european subsidiaries use the euro as the functional currency 
the functional currency of our largest european subsidiary  garmin europe ltd 
remains the us dollar  and as some transactions occurred in british pounds sterling or euros  foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the us dollar 
the company believes that gains and losses will become more material in the future as our european presence grows 
in  the us dollar weakened and  respectively  relative to the euro and british pound sterling resulting in a foreign currency gain of million in garmin ltd 
and our european subsidiaries 
the us dollar weakened against the taiwan dollar resulting in a million foreign currency loss due to the fluctuation of asset balances throughout the year 
the net result of these currency moves combined with other gains of million  and the timing of transactions during the year was a net loss of million for the company and a cumulative translation adjustment of million at the end of fiscal interest rate risk we have no outstanding long term debt as of december  we  therefore  have no meaningful debt related interest rate risk 
we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities 
as interest rates change  the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly 
a hypothetical change of in interest rates would not have a material effect on such unrealized gains or losses 
at december   pre tax cumulative net unrealized gains on those securities were million
