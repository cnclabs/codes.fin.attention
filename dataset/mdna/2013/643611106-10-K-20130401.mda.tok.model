item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview the company  through its wholly owned subsidiaries mountaineer state energy  inc and mountaineer state operations  llc 
operates oil and gas wells and mineral leases in athens and meigs counties in ohio and in calhoun  jackson and roane counties in west virginia 
the vast majority of this oil gas operation was acquired through the acquisition of the carl e 
smith companies in as of march  the company has producing gas wells  non producing wells and related equipment and mineral leases covering approximately  acres 
with the exception of wells that were drilled during the past two years the wells in west virginia and ohio were drilled in the s  the majority were drilled in the s and s 
the majority of wells are located on leased property under mineral rights contracts 
a component of the purchase price for the acquisition of carl e 
smith  inc were certain non interest bearing long term obligations which the company will paid out over the next years 
the company has evaluated the above notes and after factoring in certain offsets provided for in the agreement has valued the above obligations at  at december  as of december   the company leased one independent living community in oregon  with a capacity of residents 
a number of years ago the company has owned  leased and operated assisted living and retirement communities throughout the united states 
during that period of time the company has both acquired and sold over seventy communities 
the property in oregon is a holdover from that time period 
while not an integral part of our business plan the one remaining facility is profitable and it is anticipated that it will remain a part of the company s operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
certain of the company s accounting policies require the application of judgment in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments and estimates are based upon the company s historical experience  current trends and information available from other sources that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies are more significant to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revisions in such estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revisions become known 
oil and gas property accounting the company uses the full cost method of accounting for its investment in oil and natural gas properties 
under this method of accounting  all costs of acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties including such costs as leasehold acquisition costs  geological expenditures  dry hole costs  tangible and intangible development costs and direct internal costs are capitalized as the cost of oil and natural gas properties when incurred 
the full cost method requires the company to calculate quarterly  by cost center  a ceiling  or limitation on the amount of properties that can be capitalized on the balance sheet 
to the extent capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties  less accumulated depletion and related deferred taxes exceed the sum of the discounted future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves  the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties subject to amortization  the cost of properties not being amortized  and the related tax amounts  such excess capitalized costs are charged to expense 
beginning december   full cost companies use the unweighted arithmetic average first day of the month price for oil and natural gas for the month period preceding the calculation date to calculate the future net revenues of proved reserves 
prior to december   companies used the price in effect at the calculation date and had the option  under certain circumstances  to elect to use subsequent commodity prices if they increased after the calculation date 
the company assesses any unproved oil and gas properties on an annual basis for possible impairment or reduction in value 
the company assesses properties on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant 
the assessment includes consideration of the following factors  among others intent to drill  remaining lease term  geological and geophysical evaluations  drilling results and activity  the assignment of proved reserves  and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned 
during any period in which these factors indicate an impairment of unproved properties not subject to amortization  the associated costs incurred to date for such properties are then included in unproved properties subject to amortization 
oil and gas reserves our proved oil and gas reserves are estimated by independent petroleum engineers 
reserve engineering is a subjective process that is dependent upon the quality of available data and the interpretation thereof  including evaluations and extrapolations of well flow rates and reservoir pressure 
estimates by different engineers often vary  sometimes significantly 
in addition  physical factors such as the results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate  as well as economic factors such as changes in product prices  may justify revision of such estimates 
because proved reserves are required to be estimated using prices at the date of the evaluation  estimated reserve quantities can be significantly impacted by changes in product prices 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a of producing properties is computed on the unit of production method based on estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
while total dd a expense for the life of a property is limited to the property s total cost  proved reserve revisions result in a change in timing of when dd a expense is recognized 
downward revisions of proved reserves result in an acceleration of dd a expense  while upward revisions tend to lower the rate of dd a expense recognition 
the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows and changes in such cash flows are prepared using assumptions required by the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission 
such assumptions include using year end oil and gas prices and year end costs for estimated future development and production expenditures 
discounted future net cash flows are calculated using a rate 
changes in any of these assumptions could have a significant impact on the standardized measure 
accordingly  the standardized measure does not represent management s estimated current market value of proved reserves 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and notes receivable is based on an analysis of the risk of loss on specific accounts 
the analysis places particular emphasis on past due accounts 
management considers such information as the nature and age of the receivable  the payment history of the tenant  customer or other debtor and the financial condition of the tenant or other debtor 
management s estimate of the required allowance  which is reviewed on a quarterly basis  is subject to revision as these factors change 
deferred tax assets significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the future recoverability of the company s net deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss carry forwards 
at december   the company had a deferred tax asset due to tax deductions available to it in future years 
however  as management could not determine that it was more likely than not that the benefit of the deferred tax asset would be realized  a valuation allowance was established 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had current assets of  and current liabilities of  cash and cash equivalents totaled  at december  and  at december  new concept s principal sources of cash are property operations  sales of oil and gas  and proceeds from sales of assets 
net cash provided by continuing operating activities was  in   in and  in net cash provided by used in investing activities was  in   in and  in net cash provided by used in financing activities was  in   in and  in results of operations fiscal as compared to revenues total revenues for and were million 
in early the company entered into a five year agreement to sell its gas at an agreed upon price 
operating expenses in the company recorded a non cash charge to operations of  pursuant to the requirements of the full cost ceiling test 
in the company recorded a similar write down of million 
in oil and gas operating expenses increased by  when compared to which is almost entirely due to an increase in depletion expense of  the operating expenses for the real estate operations increased by  in when compared to during the company was in the final year of the primary year lease for its retirement facility and recorded a required accounting adjustment to reduce the accounting cost of the lease by  to give effect to a even lease expense over the entire years of the primary lease 
interest income expense interest income decreased by  in when compared to due to the company not accruing interest income on its note receivable from prime income asset management  inc see note c 
other income expense other income expense was  for as compared to  in the balances in and are comprised of numerous events 
bad debt expense in the company recorded a bad debt expense with respect to a note receivable of million dollars see item on page and footnote c on page for an explanation of the transaction fiscal as compared to revenues total revenues for were million compared to million in the primary reason for the decrease was lower prices for the company s natural gas sales 
the company does not have long term contracts for its oil and gas production and sell at the spot price with each month s deliveries 
the spot price for gas decreased all throughout operating expenses in the company recorded a non cash charge to operations of million pursuant to the requirements of the full cost ceiling test interest income expense interest income decreased approximately  in when compared to due to the company not accruing interest income on its note receivable from prime income asset management  inc see note c 
other income expense other income expense was  for as compared to  expense in the balance in is comprised of numerous events 
in the company had a write off of  for an attempted acquisition that did not occur 
bad debt expense in the company recorded a bad debt expense with respect to a note receivable of million dollars see item on page and footnote c on page for an explanation of the transaction item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all of the company s debt is financed at fixed rates of interest 
therefore  the company has minimal risk from exposure to changes in interest rates
