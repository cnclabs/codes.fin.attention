the purchase price consideration originally included preliminary estimates of the working capital assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
based on a final post closing adjustment  the cash portion of the purchase price decreased by a net million as a result of million we received during for a post closing adjustment related to changes in the working capital of hgst  partially offset by million we paid during for a post closing assumed pension adjustment

toshiba transactions in connection with the regulatory approval process of the acquisition  we announced on may  that we had closed a transaction with toshiba corporation toshiba to divest certain inch hard drive assets and to purchase toshiba storage device thailand company limited tsdt  a wholly owned subsidiary of toshiba that manufactured hard drives prior to the thailand flooding 
the net impact of these two transactions was immaterial to our consolidated financial statements

pending acquisition of stec on june   we entered into a definitive merger agreement under which stec will be acquired by hgst 
the aggregate purchase price is estimated to be approximately million in cash 
this represents approximately million in enterprise value  net of stec s cash as of march  the pending acquisition when completed will augment hgst s existing solid state storage capabilities  accelerating its ability to expand its participation in the rapidly growing area of enterprise ssds

as a percentage of net revenue  operating income was in compared to in net income in was billion  or per diluted share  compared to billion  or per diluted share  in for the september quarter  we expect overall hard drive industry shipments to increase modestly to approximately million to million units from the june quarter s million units primarily due to a seasonal increase in consumer electronics and branded product shipments 
we expect our revenue in the september quarter to remain flat or increase slightly from the june quarter reflecting modest price declines and a seasonal change in business mix

fiscal year compared to fiscal year net revenue 
net revenue was billion for  an increase of from total hard drive shipments in increased to million units as compared to million units for the prior year 
the increase resulted primarily from the contribution of a full year of hgst operations  partially offset by continued soft industry demand as well as a decrease in asp from to changes in revenue by geography and channel generally reflect normal fluctuations in market demand and competitive dynamics 
in addition  as a result of our acquisition of hgst  our revenue by channel mix has become more heavily weighted toward oem 
consistent with standard industry practice  we have sales incentive and marketing programs that provide customers with price protection and other incentives or reimbursements that are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue 
for  these programs represented of gross revenues compared to in these amounts generally vary according to several factors including industry conditions  seasonal demand  competitor actions  channel mix and overall availability of product

other income expense 
other expense  net was million in compared to million in interest expense increased from million in to million in  primarily due to interest on a higher debt balance since the acquisition 
interest income decreased slightly from million in to million in primarily due to a lower average daily invested cash balance for the period 
income tax provision 
income tax expense was million in as compared to million in tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes was in compared to in our income tax provision for also reflects a tax benefit of million as a result of the retroactive extension of the us federal research and experimentation tax credit r d credit that was signed into law on january  as part of the american taxpayer relief act of the r d credit  which had previously expired on december   was extended through december  the differences between the effective tax rate and the us federal statutory rate are primarily due to tax holidays in malaysia  the philippines  singapore and thailand that expire at various dates from through  the current year generation of income tax credits and the effect of california proposition on november   california voters approved california proposition  which affects california state income tax apportionment for most multi state taxpayers for tax years beginning on or after january  this proposition reduces our future income apportioned to california  making it less likely for us to realize certain california deferred tax assets 
as a result  we recorded an million charge in to reduce our previously recognized california deferred tax assets as of december  as of june   we had a recorded liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million 
we recognized a net decrease of million in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits during interest and penalties recognized on such amounts were not material 
the internal revenue service irs had completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for fiscal years and and issued revenue agent reports rars that proposed adjustments to income before income taxes of approximately million primarily related to transfer pricing and intercompany payable balances 
we disagreed with the proposed adjustments and filed a protest with the irs appeals office 
in june  we reached an agreement with the irs to resolve the transfer pricing issue 
this agreement resulted in a decrease in the amount of net operating loss and tax credits realized  but did not have an impact to our consolidated statements of income 
the proposed adjustment relating to intercompany payable balances for fiscal years and will be addressed in conjunction with the irs s examination of our fiscal years and  which commenced in january in addition  in january  the irs commenced an examination of the fiscal period ended september  of komag  incorporated komag 
in february  the irs commenced an examination of calendar years and of hgst  which was acquired by us on march  
table of contents we believe that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations 
however  the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty 
if any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management s expectations  we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs 
as of june   it is not possible to estimate the amount of change  if any  in the unrecognized tax benefits that is reasonably possible within the next twelve months 
any significant change in the amount of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits would most likely result from additional information or settlements relating to the examination of our uncertain tax positions
