weekend sales  defined as saturday and sunday  accounted for approximately percent of a typical week s revenue during fiscal we aim to consistently drive sales growth by continuing to implement strategies to build bob evans restaurants and to grow bob evans restaurants carryout and catering sales 
we have increased marketing of our carryout offerings  including our family meals to go  catering menu and take home family holiday farmhouse feasts 
we also introduced on line ordering for bob evans restaurants during fiscal and on line coupon code redemption in fiscal  which we believe fostered growth in our carryout business in  and during fiscal  bob evans restaurants off premise business ie  carryout and catering accounted for approximately percent of the concept s total revenues  up from percent in fiscal we will continue to focus efforts on increasing our carryout and catering business in fiscal during fiscal  we expanded our three course dinner entr e options and implemented the all you can eat hotcakes and endless farmhouse lunch  which have been driving increased sales results during all three day parts  particularly at dinner 
we believe dinner is a critical component of our plan to return to consistent positive same store sales growth 
we have also continued to drive sales through our soup layer with an increase in sales of approximately million during fiscal  as well as our new prepackaged grab and go bakery offerings 
we offer retail gifts  food items and other novelties for sale on a limited basis in the retail areas located inside most of our traditional bob evans restaurants and on a much larger scale in our six bob evans restaurants general stores 
restaurant operations and management we believe that high quality restaurant management is critical to the success of our restaurant concept 
we must be the best at operations execution to keep our customers satisfied 
our restaurant management structure varies by restaurant size 
our restaurant management structure for bob evans restaurants is organized to drive top line growth and bottom line profitability 
bob evans restaurants has a president who focuses his efforts on the overall growth and development of the concept  with particular focus on increasing sales  new restaurant development and concept evolution 
the chief restaurant operations officer is responsible for building a sales  service and people first culture that delivers best in class results for bob evans restaurants 
he also leads the bob evans restaurant s operations team  and oversees restaurant development and construction in close cooperation with the president 
the chief restaurant operations officer also leads our operations group to develop solutions for standardizing operations processes for the restaurants and ensuring that all new procedures and tools are restaurant ready 
each bob evans restaurants location employs approximately to hourly employees  and is led by a general manager  and two to three assistant managers  depending on the size  location and sales volume of the restaurant

bob evans restaurants are visited regularly by all levels of management to ensure they are functioning well and adhering to our standards 
during fiscal  we improved margins with an eye on customer satisfaction by continuing to aggressively manage labor and food costs 
we also improved our guest loyalty index scores at bob evans restaurants from percent satisfaction in fiscal to percent in fiscal additionally  we improved the actual versus theoretical food cost program to help manage food costs 
restaurant locations and expansion as of april   bob evans restaurants including bob evans restaurants and general stores were located in states  primarily in the midwest  mid atlantic and southeast 
the following table sets forth the number and location of our bob evans restaurants as of the end of fiscal restaurants in operation at april  bob evans restaurants arkansas delaware florida illinois indiana kansas kentucky maryland michigan missouri new jersey new york north carolina ohio pennsylvania south carolina tennessee virginia west virginia total we strive to continuously increase returns on invested capital 
each business segment must earn the right to receive additional capital 
we believe that we have to expand our restaurants with a focus on the quality  not just the quantity  of openings 
future restaurant growth depends on a variety of factors  including the expected rate of return on the capital invested in the new restaurant  the availability of affordable sites that meet our demographic and other specifications  general economic conditions  including consumer spending for family and casual dining  growth trends in consumer demand for our restaurant concepts  our ability to obtain local permits  and the availability of high quality management and hourly employees 
we use a site selection process for our bob evans restaurants that includes a detailed evaluation of factors such as population density  household income in the area  competition  the site s visibility and traffic patterns  accessibility  proximity to retail centers  and the demographics of potential guests 
we continually assess all of our existing restaurants under a program to determine whether any restaurants should be rebuilt  relocated  remodeled or retired 
during fiscal  we retired seven underperforming bob evans restaurants 
we believe these closures strengthened our restaurant portfolio by improving overall returns and freeing up resources for other uses  including the farm fresh refresh remodeling initiative for bob evans restaurants described below 
we believe we must innovate and change the way people think about bob evans restaurants by ensuring that the concept is relevant to our family first growth target 
during fiscal  we opened two new bob evans restaurants  compared to four in fiscal  and two in fiscal we did not rebuild any existing bob evans restaurants and remodeled existing restaurants in fiscal these restaurants are part of bob evans restaurants new farm fresh refresh remodeling initiative  which provides the restaurants with a contemporary look and feel to enhance our guests experience 
the new and remodeled restaurants feature a fresher  brighter color scheme  a new taste of the farm bakery  a dedicated carryout area  gift card displays  a redesigned retail area  and a mural depicting the heritage of the bob evans brand 
during fiscal  we plan to build up to four new bob evans restaurants and complete our current farm fresh refresh initiative chain wide 
these new restaurants will be located in high traffic retail areas or near major interstate highways located in or near existing markets to deepen the concept s penetration in successful trade areas and to expand into contiguous trade areas 
supply chain and distribution controlling our supply costs is a key strategy for improving margins with an eye on customer satisfaction 
our ability to offer high quality  reasonably priced menu items at our restaurants depends upon acquiring food products and related items from reliable sources at competitive prices 
our supply chain team sources  negotiates and purchases food and non food items from more than suppliers 
our suppliers must adhere to strict product specifications and quality control standards 
our restaurant operating margins are subject to changes in the price and availability of food commodities 
prices for many of the foods and other commodities we bought for our restaurants increased during fiscal  and we expect more increases during fiscal our operating margins are also affected by changes in the price of utilities  such as natural gas  upon which many of our restaurants depend for their energy supply 
to help control costs and obtain competitive prices  our supply chain team negotiates directly with our suppliers and occasionally uses purchase commitment contracts to stabilize the potentially volatile pricing associated with certain commodity items 
additionally  we purchase products in bulk for our food products operations and negotiate volume discounts with suppliers 
we continue to consolidate our purchasing activities for the entire company 
this allows us to leverage the combined purchasing power of our restaurant concept and bef foods segment 
as part of this effort  we use competitive bidding and reverse on line auctions for certain products and services 
the bef foods segment manufactures sausage products  as well as muffin mixes  dressings  sausage gravy  sauces and soups  which are distributed to our restaurants by third parties 
third parties distribute food and inventory items to our restaurants twice a week  on average 
our distributors purchase products from the suppliers we specify  at the prices we negotiate  and distribute them to our restaurants on a cost plus basis 
produce  breads and dairy items are sometimes delivered to restaurants more frequently and or obtained from local suppliers to ensure freshness 
during fiscal  we undertook an extensive review of our restaurant distribution system in an effort to optimize our distribution efficiency for our restaurant concept  manage our restaurant distribution risk  combine the location of products for our restaurant concept in the same distribution centers  and identify distribution partners capable of providing opportunities for additional efficiencies 
we solicited and reviewed bids from a number of distributors to service our entire restaurant system 
as a result of this process  we selected gordon food service  inc gfs as our restaurant distributors and implemented their services in fiscal distribution services to our restaurants are now handled by gfs 
in october  we sold a distribution facility located in springfield  ohio  to millard refrigerated services millard 
the distribution center was owned by bef foods  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
millard took over the operation of the  square foot facility and continued to ship bob evans brand products to retail and foodservice customers 
in november  we consolidated our transportation services in a new center located in springfield  ohio  adjacent to the distribution center 
as a result of our distribution system changes  we believe we have improved distribution efficiency  attained consistent pricing and lowered costs as we leverage the volume of our restaurant concept 
although only one distributor furnishes the majority of inventory items to our restaurants  we believe other distributors can readily provide this inventory 
we have not experienced any material or continued shortage of the products distributed by any third parties 
please see item a 
risk factors our restaurant and food products businesses are business dependent on timely delivery of fresh ingredients by our suppliers and distributors  for more information 
sources and availability of raw materials menu mix in the restaurant business is varied enough that raw materials historically have been readily available 
however  some food products may be in short supply during certain seasons and raw material prices often fluctuate according to availability 
we believe that all essential food products will continue to be generally available from our existing suppliers or  upon short notice  can be obtained from other qualified suppliers 
due to the rapid turnover of perishable food items  our restaurants maintain inventories with a modest approximately  of inventory per restaurant aggregate dollar value in relation to revenues 
advertising and marketing we spent approximately million on restaurant advertising and marketing during fiscal most of our advertising budget was spent on television  radio  print and outdoor advertising for bob evans restaurants 
we focus our advertisements on new bob evans restaurants menu items and the concept s position as offering farm fresh goodness that brings families together 
our fiscal advertising campaigns featured new menu offerings  such as our expanded three course dinner entr e options and the all you can eat hotcakes and endless farmhouse lunch 
we also remained focused on our digital marketing efforts by utilizing be mail  facebook and twitter  as well as the bob evans internet web site 
we also distribute coupons and support in store merchandising  menus  kids marketing programs  and local store marketing 
additionally  upon completion of the farm fresh refresh remodeling market  we increase our advertising in the completed market and surrounding area 
research and development research and development expenses for our restaurant concept and bef foods operation have not been material 
as part of our effort to consistently drive sales growth  we continuously test food items to identify new and improved menu and retail food product offerings to appeal to our existing customers  satisfy changing eating trends and attract new customers 
we maintain an to month product development pipeline which is focused on creating and introducing innovative menu items and retail food products  as well as enhancements to our existing offerings 
in order to keep our menu and retail food products fresh and appealing to our guests taste preferences  our product development team is concentrated on creating appealing menu offerings that are consistent with the positioning of the brand  as well as quality enhancements to some of our best selling items 
product development for both bob evans restaurants and bef foods segments focuses on home style offerings with a unique bob evans twist 
competition the restaurant industry is highly competitive 
there are numerous segments within the restaurant industry  distinguishable based on the type of food  food quality  service  location  associated price to value relationship and overall dining experience 
we have positioned our bob evans restaurants in the family dining segment 
we must be the best at operations execution to effectively compete for customers share of stomach 
the restaurant business is affected by changes in the public s eating habits and preferences  population trends  traffic patterns  weather conditions and gasoline and other energy costs  as well as by local and national economic conditions affecting consumer spending habits  many of which are beyond our control 
key competitive factors in the industry include the quality and value of menu offerings  quality and speed of service  attractiveness of facilities  advertising  name brand awareness and image  and restaurant locations 
although we believe our restaurant concept competes favorably with respect to each of these factors  many of our competitors are well established national  regional or local chains  and some have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than we have 
additionally  we compete with many restaurant operators and other retail establishments for site locations and restaurant employees 
we also face growing competition from quick service and fast casual restaurants that are improving the quality and expanding the variety of their offerings  especially at breakfast 
bef foods segment retail food product operations our vision for our bef foods segment is to be a best in class food business driven by innovation and strong retail partnerships with a portfolio of convenient meal solutions that meet consumer needs 
we offer a wide variety of quality  home style food products to retail and foodservice customers 
we sell our retail food products under the bob evans  owens and country creek brand names 
we believe our food products provide farm fresh goodness and convenient meal solutions that uphold our high quality standards 
our food products include approximately varieties of branded fresh  smoked and fully cooked pork sausage  ham and hickory smoked bacon products 
we also offer over complementary  convenience food items in the refrigerated and frozen areas of grocery stores such as mashed potatoes  macaroni and cheese  and microwaveable sandwiches 
during fiscal  we introduced approximately new retail food products  including many varieties of bob evans side dishes  precooked sausage and fresh and frozen sandwiches 
our refrigerated mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese side dishes continue to grow as a percentage of our food products volume 
we will continue to consistently drive sales growth through new product development and enhancing existing items to address changing consumer demands 
production we currently produce food products in our seven manufacturing facilities 
we produce fresh sausage products at our plants located in richardson  texas  hillsdale  michigan and xenia  ohio 
our sulphur springs  texas  and bidwell  lima  and springfield  ohio  plants produce ready to eat products  such as sandwiches  soups and gravies 
on april   the bef foods segment purchased from swh corporation and now owns and operates an approximately  square foot prep kitchen in fullerton  california  that prepares signature muffin mixes  dressings  sausage gravy  sauces and soups for bob evans restaurants and some third party restaurants  including the mimi s caf restaurant chain which was formerly owned by the company 
third party sales represent percent  percent  and percent of prep kitchen net sales for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
in august  we purchased the kettle creations brand and a  square foot production facility in lima  ohio where we produce potato and pasta based side dishes 
kettle creations previously was a co packer for bef foods 
we are in the process of modifying and expanding the kettle creations production facility by  square feet and with one additional production line at a cost of approximately million 
construction will be completed during the second quarter of fiscal we have made efforts to increase returns on invested capital by implementing a plant optimization program to ensure we are operating efficiently and are positioned for future growth 
the program is geared to identify operational gaps and opportunities to improve production efficiencies 
as a part of this program  we closed our fresh sausage plant in galva  illinois  and the fresh sausage production portion of our bidwell  ohio  plant in fiscal in may  we announced our intention to close our food production plants in springfield and bidwell  ohio 
effective march   we sold the bidwell and springfield  ohio  plants but continue to lease and operate them 
the company plans to shut down operations in the bidwell  ohio  plant in the fall of and the springfield  ohio  plant in january as part of this program  we are investing approximately million of capital to modify and add production lines to our food production facility in sulphur springs  texas  which will increase production of ready to eat food products  as well as add capacity for soups and gravies 
we strive to be the best at operations execution by always focusing on food safety 
we follow a hazard analysis and critical control points haccp program at each of our manufacturing plants 
haccp is a comprehensive system developed in conjunction with government agencies to prevent food safety problems by addressing physical  chemical and biological hazards 
we use haccp to identify potential safety hazards so that key actions can be taken to reduce or eliminate risks during production 
we also have a team dedicated to food safety and quality assurance 
during fiscal  all of our manufacturing plants earned certification pursuant to global food safety initiative standards 
we use third parties to manufacture or co pack the bob evans and owens products that are not produced in our own facilities 
these co packed items include some of our mashed potatoes  macaroni and cheese  and meat items 
at the end of fiscal  we used approximately third parties to manufacture food products for us 
sales the us food industry has experienced significant consolidation over the last years as competitors have shed non core businesses and made strategic acquisitions to complement category positions  maximize economies of scale in raw material sourcing and production  and expand retail distribution 
the importance of sustaining strong relationships with retailers has become a critical success factor for food companies because it drives category management and continuous replenishment programs 
food companies with category leadership positions and strong retail relationships have increasingly benefited from these initiatives as a way to maintain shelf space and maximize distribution efficiencies 
although our bob evans brand mashed potatoes are only available on a limited basis in some parts of the country  it is the leading brand of refrigerated mashed potatoes in the united states based on pound sales and information resource inc total us grocery data weeks ending september 
our goal is to consistently drive sales growth by leveraging our strong share position to secure additional retail store business and gain additional market penetration 
we also believe strong brand awareness is critical in maintaining and securing valuable retail shelf space and will provide a strong platform for introducing product line extensions and new products 
our retail sales force  which consists of our national account teams as well as third party food brokers  sells our food products to a number of leading national and regional retail chains 
retail sales are approximately percent of net sales  while foodservice sales account for approximately percent of net sales 
a relatively small number of customers accounts for a large percentage of our sales 
for fiscal  our largest accounts represented approximately percent of our total bef foods sales  with the top two customers representing approximately percent of our bef foods segment sales 
as part of our effort to win together as a team  we maintain national account teams to address the needs of our key retailers on a long term basis 
we continue to devote time and effort on sales of our products to foodservice customers ie  third party restaurants  schools and other commercial buyers 
in fiscal  net sales to foodservice customers accounted for approximately percent of our food products business 
items for our foodservice customers are made to their specifications and include sausage  sausage gravy and breakfast sandwiches 
foodservice sales provide us with incremental volume in our production plants  as well as an opportunity for future growth 
distribution we supply our customers by shipping products directly to their warehouses for further distribution by the customers to their retail stores 
we also distribute our products through food wholesalers and distributors who primarily service smaller  independent grocers 
at the end of fiscal  bob evans and owens brand products were available for purchase in grocery stores in all states  the district of columbia  and the ontario  canada area 
our owens brand products were available for purchase primarily in oklahoma and texas 
during fiscal  we sold to unaffiliated third parties who then sell our grilling sausage  side dish and frozen breakfast items in the ontario  canada area  and some of our owens brand products are in parts of mexico 
less than one percent of our fiscal revenue is attributable to sales by these third parties of our food products in canada and or mexico 
we continue to work with retailers in states where there is an opportunity to distribute our products 
we will explore expansion prospects with retailers to profitably increase points of distribution 
during fiscal  we added nearly new item authorizations ie  orders from customers for products they have not ordered from us before  which represents a percent growth over sources and availability of raw materials the most important raw material used in our food products business is live sows  which we depend upon to produce our pork sausage products 
we procure live sows at prevailing market prices from terminals  local auctions  country markets and corporate and family farms in many states and canada 
the live sow market is highly volatile in terms of the number of sows available and market price 
the live sow market is also dependent upon supply and demand for pork products  as well as corn and soybean meal prices the major food supply for sows  weather and farmers access to capital 
in fiscal  we believe the bef foods segment will continue to be challenged by sow costs that are significantly higher than historical averages  with the potential for higher exports of raw pork products which could put a strain on supply 
to date  we have not experienced any significant or prolonged difficulty in procuring live sows 
we have not traditionally contracted in advance for the purchase of live sows  although we have done so in limited quantities from time to time 
we have  however  entered into some contracts with regard to the purchase of live sows in which we have agreed to accept a specific number of truck loads per week with pricing based on the current market price plus yield premiums 
other important raw materials used in our food products operations are potatoes  seasonings and packaging materials 
historically  these materials have been readily available  although some items may be in short supply during certain seasons and price fluctuations according to availability 
such shortages did not have a material impact on net sales or operating income 
generally  we purchase these items under supply contracts  and we occasionally engage in forward buying when we believe it to be advantageous 
we believe that these items will continue to be available from our existing suppliers or  upon short notice  can be obtained from other qualified suppliers 
most of our food products are highly perishable and require proper refrigeration 
product shelf life ranges from to days for refrigerated products 
due to the highly perishable nature and shelf life of these items  our production plants normally process only enough products to fill existing orders 
as a result  we maintain minimal inventory levels 
with our transition to a warehouse delivery system  many of our breakfast and dinner sausage items are frozen and shipped to warehouses 
shipping frozen product allows our retailers added flexibility to slack out product to meet consumer demand and allows us to build inventory for heavy consumption periods 
advertising and marketing during fiscal  we spent approximately million advertising our food products  excluding coupons and trade promotion marketing costs 
our food products marketing programs consist of advertising  consumer promotions and trade promotions 
our advertising activities include television  radio  newspaper  digital and magazine advertisements aimed at increasing brand awareness and building consumer loyalty 
consumer promotions include the distribution of recipes featuring our products and targeted coupons designed to attract new customers and increase the frequency of purchases 
our trade promotions are aimed at providing retail display support and securing additional shelf space 
during fiscal  we continued to win together as a team and consistently drive sales growth through joint marketing programs to support both our bob evans restaurants and bef foods segments 
competition the food products business is highly competitive and is affected by changes in the public s eating habits and preferences  as well as by local and national economic conditions affecting consumer spending habits  many of which are beyond our control 
key competitive factors in the industry are the quality  flavor and value of the food products offered  advertising and name brand awareness 
we believe that we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors 
our competitors include well established national  regional and local producers and wholesalers of similar products  some of whom have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than we have 
we also face growing competition from private label sausage products and side dishes 
with respect to our sausage products  our major competitors include the sausage products of johnsonville sausage llc ie  johnsonville brand and the hillshire brands company ie  jimmy dean brand 
seasonality and quarterly results our bob evans restaurants and bef foods segments are subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  our highest levels of revenue and net income at bob evans restaurants occurred in the first and second quarters of our fiscal year 
many bob evans restaurants are located near major interstate highways and generally experience increased revenue during the summer travel season 
holidays  severe weather conditions such as snow storms  hurricanes  and thunderstorms  natural disasters such as flooding  tornadoes  and earthquakes and similar conditions impact restaurant sales volumes in some of the markets in which we operate 
our bef foods business segment is seasonal to the extent that third and fourth quarter sales are typically higher due to increased sales of sausage and our home style side dishes during the colder months from november through april and especially during the holiday season 
we promote our bratwurst and italian sausage products for outdoor grilling in an attempt to grow volume during the summer months 
our consolidated quarterly results are significantly impacted by the cost and availability of raw materials  especially live sows 
our consolidated quarterly results are also impacted by the timing of new restaurant openings and remodels and their associated costs 
as a result of these and other factors  our financial results for any given quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
trademarks and service marks we have registered trademarks and service marks  such as the mark bob evans for our restaurant business  and bob evans  owens  country creek farm  kettle creations  and swh custom foods  for bef foods 
we use additional registered and proprietary marks 
we maintain a registration program for our marks with the united states patent and trademark office and in certain foreign countries 
in order to better protect our brands  we have also registered our ownership of the internet domain names such as www 
bobevans 
com  beffoods 
com  bobevansfoods 
com and www 
kettlecreations 
net 
we believe that our trademarks  service marks  proprietary recipes and other proprietary rights have significant value and are important to our brand building efforts and the marketing of our bob evans restaurants and bef foods segments 
we have vigorously protected our proprietary rights in the past and expect to continue to do so 
we cannot predict  however  whether steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of these rights or the use by others of restaurant features based upon  or otherwise similar to  our concepts 
it may be difficult for us to prevent others from copying elements of our restaurant concepts and food products  and any litigation to enforce our rights would likely be costly 
government regulation we are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws affecting our businesses 
our restaurant segment is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities  which may include health  sanitation  environmental  zoning and public safety agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located 
difficulties in obtaining or failures to obtain the required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the development and openings of new restaurants or could disrupt the operations of existing restaurants 
however  we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable governmental regulations and  to date  we have not experienced abnormal difficulties or delays in obtaining the licenses or approvals required to open or operate any of our restaurants 
various federal and state labor laws govern our operations and our relationships with our employees  including such matters as minimum wage  meal and rest breaks  overtime  fringe benefits  safety  working conditions and citizenship requirements 
significant government imposed increases in minimum wages  paid or unpaid leaves of absence  paid sick days or other paid time off  mandated health benefits for all employees or increased tax reporting  assessment or payment requirements related to our employees who receive gratuities could be detrimental to the profitability of our bob evans restaurants and bef foods operations 
minimum wage increases in many states in which we operated during fiscal affected the profitability of our restaurants and led to increased menu prices 
various proposals that would require employers to provide paid time off for all of their employees are considered from time to time in federal and state legislative bodies 
the costs of insurance and medical care have risen significantly over the past few years and are expected to continue to increase 
existing or potential legislation changes  such as proposals to require employers to provide health insurance to all or a significant number of additional employees  could negatively impact our operating results 
the imposition of any requirement that we provide paid time off or health insurance to all or a significant number of additional employees could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position  as well as the restaurant industry in general 
our suppliers may also be affected by higher minimum wage and benefit standards  which could result in higher costs for goods and services supplied to us 
we have a significant number of hourly restaurant employees that receive tip income 
we have elected to voluntarily participate in a tip reporting alternative commitment trac agreement with the internal revenue service 
by complying with the educational and other requirements of the trac agreement  we reduce the likelihood of potential employer only fica assessments for unreported or underreported tips 
there have been a number of federal  state and local proposals and regulations to require restaurants to provide nutritional information on menus and or require that restaurants label menus with the country of origin of meal ingredients 
for example  the bob evans restaurant located in montgomery county  maryland  is subject to a menu labeling law that became effective on july  the national health care reform legislation enacted on march   contains provisions that require restaurants with or more locations to post calorie information on menus and additional nutritional information in writing at the restaurant 
the food and drug administration fda has released two sets of proposed regulations and is in the process of soliciting comments 
the fda is hoping to issue the final rules by the end of and is proposing that the final rules become effective six months from the date of publication for covered restaurants 
although the new federal legislation would preempt the state and local legislation already enacted eg  california  maine  massachusetts  new jersey  oregon  nashville  tennessee  new york city  new york and philadelphia  pennsylvania  some of these jurisdictions are requiring compliance with their regulations until the fda begins enforcing the federal regulations 
we are concerned that these menu labeling laws could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position  as well as the restaurant industry in general 
however  we support the implementation of uniform standards across the united states by the fda  rather than a state by state and locality by locality approach 
potential changes in labor laws  including the possible passage of all or parts of the proposed employee free choice act  or the subsequent version proposed in known as the labor relations first contract act  could result in portions of our workforce being subjected to greater organized labor influence 
these proposals could impact the nature of labor relations in the united states  specifically  how union elections and contract negotiations are conducted 
these proposals aim to make it easier for unions to form and employers of unionized employees may face mandatory  binding arbitration of labor scheduling  costs and standards  which could increase the costs of doing business 
although we do not currently have any union employees  these proposals or similar labor legislation could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results by imposing requirements that could potentially increase our costs  reduce our flexibility and impact our ability to serve our guests 
our restaurants and manufacturing plants must comply with the applicable requirements of the americans with disabilities act of ada and related state statutes 
the ada prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability with respect to public accommodations and employment 
under the ada and related state laws  when constructing new restaurants and facilities or undertaking significant remodeling of existing restaurants and facilities  we must make them more readily accessible to people with disabilities 
we also must make reasonable accommodations for the employment of people with disabilities 
the ada was amended recently to significantly expand the categories of individuals who are deemed to have disabilities 
as a manufacturer and distributor of food products  our bef foods segment is subject to a number of food safety regulations  including regulations promulgated by the us department of agriculture usda and the fda 
these agencies enact and enforce regulations relating to the manufacturing  labeling  packaging  distribution and safety of food in the united states 
among other matters  these agencies enforce statutory prohibitions against misbranded and adulterated foods  establish safety standards for food processing  establish standards for ingredients and manufacturing procedures for certain foods  establish standards for identifying certain foods  determine the safety of food additives  establish labeling standards and nutrition labeling requirements for food products  and enforce regulations to prevent the introduction  transmission or spread of communicable diseases 
in addition  various states regulate our operations by enforcing federal and state standards for selected food products  grading food products  licensing and inspecting plants and warehouses  regulating trade practices related to the sale of food products  and imposing their own labeling requirements on food products 
some of the food commodities we use in our operations are also subject to governmental agricultural programs 
these programs have substantial effects on prices and supplies and are subject to congressional and administrative review 
through our sausage manufacturing operations  our bef foods segment is subject to the requirements of the packers stockyards act the p s act 
the general purpose of the p s act is to assure fair competition and fair trade practices  safeguard farmers and ranchers  protect consumers  and protect members of the livestock  meat and poultry industries from unfair  deceptive  unjustly discriminatory and monopolistic practices 
the p s act is administered by the grain inspection  packers stockyards administration gipsa  which is part of the usda 
among other requirements  the p s act requires meat packers  such as our bef foods segment  to be bonded  which provides trust protection for producers in the event they are not paid for livestock by a meat packer  and requires that livestock producers be paid promptly by meat packers for the sale of livestock 
violations of the p s act may be resolved through a notice of violation  a stipulation agreement with gipsa  administrative actions and court actions 
we are subject to federal and state environmental regulations  including various laws concerning the handling  storage and disposal of hazardous materials  such as cleaning solvents 
these regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our operations to date 
we do not anticipate that compliance with federal  state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or which otherwise relate to the protection of the environment  will have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures  revenues or competitive position 
us federal  state and local laws and regulations are increasingly being enacted to address concerns about the effects that carbon dioxide emissions and other identified greenhouse gases ghg may have on the environment and climate worldwide 
these effects are widely referred to as climate change 
one or more of our bef foods segment manufacturing facilities could be covered by such new legislation 
as in virtually every industry  ghg emissions occur at several points across our operations  including production  transportation and processing 
compliance with future legislation  if any  and compliance with currently evolving regulation of ghgs by the epa and states may result in increased compliance costs  capital expenditures  and operating costs 
in the event that any future compliance requirements at any of our facilities require more than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor emissions and improve our energy efficiency  we may experience increases in our costs of operation 
these regulatory changes may also lead to higher cost of goods and services  which may be passed on to us by suppliers 
based on information currently available to us  we believe that compliance with these regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us 
from time to time  we receive notices and inquiries from regulatory authorities and others asserting that we are not in compliance with particular laws and regulations 
in some instances  litigation ensues 
in addition  individuals may initiate litigation against us 
many of our facilities are subject to environmental permits and other regulatory requirements  violations of which are subject to civil and criminal sanction 
in some cases  third parties may also have the right to sue to enforce compliance 
employees as of april   we employed  persons  full time and  part time  including  persons in our bob evans restaurants segment  persons in our bef foods segment  and at our corporate office 
none of our employees are currently covered by collective bargaining agreements  and we have never experienced an organized work stoppage  strike or labor dispute 
we believe our working conditions and compensation packages are generally comparable with those offered by our competitors 
we consider overall relations with our employees to be favorable

risk factors 
the risk factors presented below may have a material adverse effect on our future operating results  financial position and cash flows 
the categories listed below are for information purposes only and do not signify that any risk should or should not be included in one or more of the other categories  or that any category or risk is more significant than any other risk 
in addition to the risk factors presented below  changes in general economic conditions  consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns  demographic trends and consumer confidence in the economy  which affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining occasions and retail purchases in general  may have a material adverse effect on us 
our actual results could vary significantly from any results expressed or implied by any forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k or our other filings with the securities and exchange commission depending upon a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  the following risks and uncertainties i 
strategic we depend on initiatives designed to improve the efficiencies  costs and effectiveness of our operations  as well as increase revenues  and failure to fully achieve or sustain these initiatives could adversely affect our results of operations 
we have had  and expect to continue to have  initiatives related to cost efficiencies and revenue generation in various stages of testing  evaluation and implementation  upon which we expect to rely on to improve our results of operations and financial condition 
many of these initiatives are inherently risky and uncertain in their application to our business in general  even when tested successfully on a more limited scale 
it is possible that successful testing can result partially from resources and attention that cannot be duplicated in broader implementation 
testing and general implementation also can be affected by other risk factors described herein that reduce the results expected 
successful system wide implementation across hundreds of restaurants and involving tens of thousands of employees relies on consistency of training  stability of workforce  ease of execution and the absence of offsetting factors that can adversely influence results 
failure to achieve successful implementation of our initiatives could adversely affect our results of operations 
we depend on consumer acceptance of our menu offerings  food products  prices  atmosphere  convenience and service procedures 
our success in creating demand for our restaurant menu offerings and food products is dependent on our ability to continue to accurately predict consumer dining and taste preferences and adapt our menu and food products to trends in food consumption 
if customer eating habits change significantly and we are unable to respond with appropriately priced menu offerings and food products  as well as convenience and service procedures  it could have a material adverse effect on demand for our menu offerings and food products  which would result in lost customers and a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our success is also dependent upon our ability to provide outstanding customer service  convenience and to keep the atmosphere of our restaurant segment differentiated from our competitors  and relevant and appealing to our customers 
if we change our restaurant concept or customer service technique  we may lose customers who do not prefer the changed concept or customer service technique  and we may not be able to attract a sufficient new customer base to produce the revenue needed to make the concept or technique profitable 
our long term growth strategy depends on opening new restaurants 
our ability to expand our restaurant base is influenced by factors beyond our control  which may slow restaurant expansion and impair our growth strategy 
we are pursuing a disciplined long term growth strategy which  to be successful  will depend in large part on our ability to open new restaurants and operate those restaurants on a profitable basis 
we do not intend to substantially increase the construction of new restaurants until we are confident that we have adequately improved restaurant level economics by increasing our sales  lowering our labor  materials and construction costs and increasing our margins and profitability 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to achieve our expansion goals or operating results similar to those of our existing restaurants 
one of our biggest challenges in meeting our long term growth objectives will be to locate and secure an adequate supply of suitable new restaurant sites 
we have experienced delays in opening some of our restaurants and may experience delays in the future 
delays or failures in opening new restaurants could have a material adverse effect on our planned long term growth strategy 
the success of any restaurant expansion will depend upon numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control  including the following our ability to generate a suitable level of return on the money we invest in new restaurants  the availability and hiring of qualified personnel  our ability to appropriately train employees and staff the restaurants  our ability to identify available and suitable restaurant sites  competition for restaurant sites  negotiation of favorable purchase or lease terms for restaurant sites  timely development of new restaurants  including the availability of construction materials and labor  management and control of construction and development costs of new restaurants  our ability to manage construction delays related to the opening of any facility  our ability to manage the local  state or other regulatory  zoning and licensing processes in a timely manner  or at all  cost and availability of capital  competition in our markets  consumer acceptance of our restaurants in new markets  and general economic conditions 
in addition  we plan to continue entering new markets in which we have no operating experience 
these new markets may have different demographic characteristics  competitive conditions  consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns compared to our existing markets  which may cause the new restaurants to be less successful in these new markets than in our existing markets 
our long term growth strategy may strain our management  financial and other resources 
for instance  our existing restaurant management systems and procedures  financial controls  information systems  management resources and human resources may be inadequate to support our planned expansion 
also  we may not be able to respond on a timely basis to all of the changing demands that the planned expansion will impose on our infrastructure and other resources 
our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems  procedures and controls and locate  hire  train and retain management and operating personnel 
we may experience higher than anticipated costs associated with the opening of new restaurants or with the closing  relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants  which may adversely affect our results of operations 
our sales and expenses can be impacted significantly by the number and timing of the opening of new restaurants and the closing  relocating and remodeling of existing restaurants 
we incur substantial preopening expenses each time we open a new restaurant and other expenses when we close  relocate or remodel existing restaurants 
the expenses of opening  closing  relocating or remodeling any of our restaurants may be higher than anticipated 
an increase in such expenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
our restaurant business is dependent upon satisfactory customer service  and we may have difficulty hiring and retaining a sufficient number of qualified employees to deliver appropriate service 
our restaurant business depends in part upon our ability to attract  train  motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees  including restaurant managers  kitchen staff and servers who can meet the high standards necessary to deliver the levels of food quality and service on which our restaurant segment is based upon 
the short supply of qualified individuals in some areas could strain our restaurant operations  delay new restaurant openings or require us to increase wages to attract desired individuals  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
also  high rates of employee turnover could have a negative impact on food quality  recruiting and training costs  and customer service  which would result in an adverse effect on our restaurant business and results of operations 
we depend on our ability to compete effectively in the restaurant and food products industries 
the restaurant industry is highly competitive and is affected by changes in the public s eating habits and preferences  population trends  traffic patterns and weather conditions  as well as by local and national economic conditions affecting consumer spending habits  many of which are beyond our control 
key competitive factors in the restaurant industry include the quality and value of the menu items offered  food preparation and consistency of the preparation from restaurant to restaurant  quality and speed of service  attractiveness of facilities  advertising  name brand awareness and image and restaurant locations 
many of our competitors are well established national  regional or local chains  and some have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than we have  which may give them competitive advantages 
we compete with many restaurant operators and other retail establishments for site locations and restaurant employees 
we also compete with grocery store chains that offer cooked and prepared products for the consumer 
we expect competition to intensify as our competitors expand operations in our markets and quick service restaurant chains expand their breakfast offerings 
this increased competition could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
the food products industry is also highly competitive and is affected by changes in the public s eating habits and preferences  as well as by local and national economic conditions affecting consumer spending habits 
key competitive factors in the industry include the quality  flavor and value of the food products offered  advertising and name brand awareness 
our competitors include well established national  regional and local producers and wholesalers of similar products  many of whom have substantially greater name recognition and financial  marketing and other resources than we have  which may give them competitive advantages 
we are facing increased competition from private label sausage products and side dishes 
we expect competition to intensify in our bef foods segment as other food companies introduce refrigerated side dishes to compete with our successful potato and side dishes 
this increased competition could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
our marketing and branding strategies may not be successful  which could negatively affect our business 
our marketing and branding strategies continue to evolve to maximize our appeal to customers and compete effectively 
we do not have any assurance that our marketing strategies will be successful 
if new advertising  modified branding  and other marketing programs are not successful  we may not generate the level of restaurant and food products sales we expect and the expenses associated with these programs will negatively affect our financial results 
moreover  many of our competitors have successfully used national marketing strategies  including network and cable television advertising in the past  and we may not be able to successfully compete against those established programs 
our failure to achieve and maintain positive same store sales for an extended period of time would likely have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition  results of operation and cash flows 
same store sales are a key measure of the financial health of our company  as well as our individual restaurants 
same store sales growth may be affected by a number of factors  including local and national economic conditions affecting consumer spending habits  gasoline prices  customer trends  intense competition in the restaurant business  customer satisfaction  extraordinary events such as weather or natural disasters  and pricing pressure 
the growth of our bef foods segment s sales and profits is dependent upon our ability to expand into existing and new markets 
the successful growth of our bef foods segment depends on our ability to add new retail customers  as well as expand the number of products sold through existing retail customers by expanding the number of our items they offer for sale and product placement within the refrigerated meat and the frozen products departments 
the expansion of the bef foods business segment depends on our ability to obtain and retain large account customers  such as grocery store chains and warehouse customers 
our failure to obtain and retain new large account customers or maintain our relationships with existing large account customers could have a material adverse effect on the bef foods segments business and results of operations 
our bef foods segment s business is dependent upon a limited number of suppliers for the production of a significant number of items and relies upon a relatively small number of customers for a large percentage of its sales 
our bef foods segment s business is dependent upon a limited number of suppliers  and we have not always identified secondary suppliers for food products manufactured in our plants  or secondary suppliers with sufficient capacity 
our prolonged inability to provide products to fill orders in a timely manner would have an adverse effect on both our bob evans restaurants and the bef foods segments businesses and our results of operations 
our bef foods segment s business also relies upon a relatively small number of customers for a large percentage of its sales 
our inability to maintain strong relationships with our key customers could result in a loss of business  which would have a material adverse effect on our bef foods business and our results of operations 
the financial performance and results of operations of the bef foods segment could be adversely affected by availability of and price we pay for sows 
sows are the most important raw material used to produce our pork sausage products in our bef foods segment 
we procure live sows at prevailing market prices from terminals  local auctions  country markets and corporate and family farms in many states and canada 
the live sow market is highly volatile in terms of the number of sows available and the current market price 
the live sow market is dependent upon supply and demand for pork products  as well as corn and soybean meal prices the major food supply for sows  weather and farmers access to capital 
we believe our bef foods segment will continue to be challenged by sow costs that are significantly higher than historical averages 
higher sow costs adversely affect the bef foods segment s profitability  and we cannot guaranty that we will be able to pass along any portion to our consumers in a timely manner or at all 
because many of our restaurants are concentrated in certain geographic areas  there could be a material adverse effect on our operations by regional economic conditions and events 
the concentration of many of our existing and planned restaurants in particular regions of the united states could affect our operating results in a number of ways 
for example  our results of operations may be adversely affected by economic conditions in that region  the local labor market and regional competition 
also  adverse publicity relating to our restaurants in a region in which they are concentrated could have a more pronounced adverse effect on our overall revenue than might be the case if our restaurants were more broadly dispersed 
a majority of our bob evans restaurants are located in ohio and other parts of the midwest  which makes us particularly sensitive to economic conditions  natural disasters  severe weather and other events in this region 
we believe same store sales at our bob evans restaurants are particularly sensitive to economic conditions in the midwest  which has been hit particularly hard by the downturn in the united states economy  the troubled auto industry  increased unemployment and lower home values 
we have bob evans restaurants located in michigan and ohio where the impact of job loss in the automotive industry manufacturers and suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our sales 
our ability to align our corporate culture to adapt to evolving business changes and requirements could have a material adverse effect on us in the future 
our results may be adversely affected if we are unable to execute on the key elements of our strategic plan to improve our delivery execution  resource utilization  and decision making processes 
as with any organization with over  employees  effecting significant changes in operational regimes and corporate culture is a challenge 
if we are unable to change and instill within our entire organization the appropriate operational regimes of our corporate culture  we may not be able to gain the anticipated improvements and increase our profitability 
the implementation of our strategic plan will require  among other things  expending capital  developing and adopting new technologies  recruiting talented employees and changing our corporate culture 
if we are unable to successfully execute any or all of the initiatives of our strategic plan  our revenues  operating results and profitability may be adversely affected 
ii 
operations our business could suffer if we are the subject of negative publicity or litigation regarding allegations of food related contaminations or illnesses 
as a business with a restaurant segment and a food production segment  we can be adversely affected by complaints or litigation from consumers alleging illness  injury or other food quality  adverse health effects including obesity or operational concerns 
our reputation and business can also be adversely affected by negative publicity resulting from such complaints or litigation 
food related contaminations and illnesses may be caused by a variety of food borne pathogens  such as e coli or salmonella  from a variety of illnesses transmitted by restaurant workers  such as hepatitis a  and from contamination of food by foreign substances 
contamination and food borne illness incidents could also be caused by food suppliers and distributors 
as a result  we cannot control all of the potential sources of contamination or illness that can be contained in or transmitted from food 
if any person becomes injured or ill  or alleges becoming injured or ill  as a result of eating our food  we may temporarily close some restaurants or a bef foods segment plant  which would decrease our revenues  and we may be liable for damages  be subject to governmental regulatory action and or receive adverse publicity  regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are liable  any of which could have long lasting  negative effects on our reputation  financial position and results of operations 
unfavorable publicity  or a failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity  could harm our reputation and adversely impact our guest counts and sales 
the good reputation of our restaurant and foods brands is a key factor in the success of our business 
actual or alleged incidents at any of our restaurants or plants could result in negative publicity that could harm our brands 
given the extensive use of the internet and various forms of social networking web sites  as well as our own web site  unfavorable publicity can spread world wide in only hours 
even incidents occurring at restaurants operated by our competitors or in the supply chain generally could result in negative publicity that could harm the restaurant and food processing industry overall and  indirectly  our own brands 
negative publicity may result from allegations of illegal  unfair or inconsistent employment practices  guest discrimination  illness  injury  or any of the other matters discussed above that could give rise to litigation 
regardless of whether the allegations or complaints are valid  unfavorable publicity relating to a limited number of our restaurants or plants  or only to a single restaurant or plant  could adversely affect public perception of the entire brand 
negative publicity also may result from health concerns including food safety and flu outbreaks  publication of government or industry findings concerning food products  environmental disasters  crime incidents  data privacy breaches  scandals involving our employees  or operational problems at our restaurants or plants  all of which could make our brands less appealing to our guests and customers  and negatively impact our guest counts and sales 
adverse publicity and its effect on overall consumer perceptions of our brands  or our failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
catastrophic events may disrupt our business and could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
we are a highly automated business and rely on our production facilities and our network infrastructure and our web site for our development  marketing  operational  support  hosted services and sales including on line ordering activities 
a disruption  infiltration or failure of these systems or third party hosted services in the event of a major natural disaster  fire  power loss  telecommunications failure  cyber attack  war  terrorist attack  or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions  reputational harm  loss of intellectual property  delays in our product development  lengthy interruptions in our services  breaches of data security and loss of critical data 
in the past  severe weather conditions and natural disasters have caused power outages and other circumstances which have adversely affected the operations of our corporate office in columbus  ohio  individual food manufacturing plants  and restaurants 
our bef foods segment operates seven manufacturing plants 
if we were forced to close or delay production at one or more of these plants due to a natural disaster or significant labor issue  we may be unable to increase production at our other plants in a timely manner  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
also  the restaurant segment relies on a single site prep kitchen for preparation of a substantial amount of its muffin mixes  dressings  sausage gravy  sauces and soups 
any temporary or permanent disruption in the operation of this facility would affect the ability of the restaurant segment to serve the full range of menu offerings or require us to obtain these items from alternative sources  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of our data center or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and  as a result  our future operating results could be adversely affected 
we have recently deployed a more robust disaster recovery plan and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events 
we have not experienced material cyber incidents to date  however the occurrence and effects of cyber incidents may remain undetected for an extended period 
we rely heavily on information technology and any material failure  interruption  or security breach in our systems could adversely affect our business 
we rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations  including for the order and delivery from distributors  point of sale processing in our restaurants  gift and loyalty cards  online business  and various other processes and transactions  including the storage of employee and customer information 
our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production  distribution  and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems 
the failure of these systems to operate effectively  problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems  or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product sales and reduced efficiency of our operations  and significant capital investments could be required to remediate the problem 
additionally  if a person is able to circumvent the security measures intended to protect our employee or customer private data  he or she could destroy or steal valuable information or disrupt our operations  which could significantly harm our reputation or result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties 
we expect to increase investments in our systems in fiscal to provide greater access for customers  increase operational capabilities  and begin to replace our core enterprise resource planning systems 
operational excellence and the continued improvement of our customer experience are among our highest priorities 
as a result  we expect to make increased investments during fiscal in our technology infrastructure  and the labor necessary to support this technology  in areas designed to more effectively collect and process our enterprise information and data for resource planning  as well as positively impacting the way in which our customers interact with us  including through the ordering process  food production and finally through the delivery of food to the customer 
our inability to effectively implement the start of our core enterprise resource planning systems replacement  as well as the other changes to our technology infrastructure will negatively impact our operations and processes and could have a negative impact on our financial results 
if we lose the services of any of our key management personnel  our business could suffer 
we depend on the continued services and performance of our key management personnel 
our future performance will depend on our ability to motivate and retain these and other key officers and key team members  particularly regional and area managers and restaurant general managers 
competition for high quality employees is intense 
the loss of the services from our senior management or key team members or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed could harm our business 
our restaurant and food products businesses are dependent on timely delivery of fresh ingredients by our suppliers and distributors 
our restaurant operations and food products business are dependent on timely deliveries of fresh ingredients  including fresh produce  dairy products and meat 
the cost  availability and quality of the ingredients we use to prepare our food are subject to a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
fluctuations in weather  supply and demand  the economy and political conditions could adversely affect the cost  availability and quality of our ingredients 
if the variety or quality of the food we offer declines due to the lack or lower quality of our ingredients or due to interruptions in the flow of fresh ingredients  customer traffic or food product orders may decline and negatively affect our sales 
we have contracted with one primary and other third party distributors for the delivery of food and other products to our restaurants 
if our primary distributor or these contracts were suddenly and unexpectedly terminated  supply costs could increase and disruptions in distribution could occur during the transition to other third party distributors 
the price and availability of food  ingredients and utilities used by our restaurants could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
our business is subject to the general risks of inflation 
our results of operations depend significantly on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the price and availability of food  ingredients  utilities  and other related costs over which we may have little control 
fluctuations in economic conditions  weather and demand  as well as natural disasters can adversely affect the availability  quality and cost of the ingredients and products that we buy 
we require fresh produce  dairy products and meat  and therefore are subject to the risk that shortages or interruptions in supply of these food products could develop 
our operating margins are subject to changes in the price and availability of food commodities 
for example  the profitability of our bef foods segment is sensitive to sow costs 
the effect of  introduction of  or changes to tariffs or exchange rates on imported retail products or food products could increase our costs and possibly affect the supply of those products 
our operating margins are also affected by fluctuations in the price of utilities such as natural gas  whether as a result of inflation or otherwise  on which our restaurants depend for much of their energy supply 
our inability to anticipate and respond effectively to an adverse change in any of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  because we provide a moderately priced product  we may not seek or be able to pass along price increases to our guests sufficient to offset cost increases 
market supply and demand and the prices we receive for our products may fluctuate due to competition from other food producers and processors  as well as the availability or price of competing proteins 
we face competition from other food producers and processors 
some of the factors on which we compete and which may drive demand for our products include product safety and quality  brand identification  breadth and depth of product offerings  and availability of our products and competing products  demand for our products also is affected by competitors promotional spending  the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing programs  and the availability or price of competing proteins 
our inability to successfully and sufficiently raise menu and food products prices to offset increased costs could result in a decline in margins 
we utilize price increases for menu offerings and food products to help offset cost increases  including increased costs for wholesale food  raw materials  distribution  minimum wages  employee benefits  construction  fuel  utility  and other costs 
during fiscal  we implemented menu price increases at bob evans restaurants to help offset operating and supply cost increases 
further federal legislation to increase the minimum wage as well as the tip credit wage we pay to certain staff members receiving guest gratuities is probable  and there may be similar increases implemented in other jurisdictions in which we operate or seek to operate 
we may not be able to anticipate and react to changing costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and prices to sufficiently account for increased costs  especially further minimum wage increases at the federal and or state level 
also  because we offer moderately priced food  we may not be able to  or we may choose not to  pass along price increases to our customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we outsource certain business processes and product manufacturing to third party vendors that subjects us to risks  including disruptions in business and increased costs 
some of our business processes and the manufacturing of certain products are currently outsourced to third parties 
such processes include distribution of food and retail products to our restaurant locations  manufacturing of certain products  credit card authorization and processing  gift card tracking and authorization  health care and workers compensation insurance claims processing and externally hosted systems and business software applications 
we cannot ensure that all providers of outsourced services are observing proper internal control practices  such as redundant processing facilities  and there are no guarantees that failures will not occur 
failure of third parties to provide adequate services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
iii 
compliance the restaurant and food products industries are heavily regulated  and compliance with applicable laws and regulations may be more costly than we expect 
the restaurant industry and the food products industry are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to health  sanitation  safety and fire standards  federal and state laws governing our relationships with employees including the fair labor standards act of  the immigration reform and control act of  the patient protection and affordable care act  the health care and education reconciliation act of and applicable requirements concerning minimum wage  overtime  healthcare coverage  family leave  medical privacy  tip credits  working conditions  safety standards and immigration status  federal and state laws which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities  such as the americans with disabilities act of compliance with these legal requirements may be more costly than we expect 
the failure to obtain and or retain licenses  permits or other regulatory approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a restaurant and or the continued operation of a particular restaurant or food products manufacturing facility 
our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could also result in fines or legal actions that could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial position 
significant legal and regulatory issues affecting our business include employment laws  including minimum wage requirements  overtime pay  meal and rest break requirements  paid sick days or other paid time off  unemployment tax rates  discrimination laws  workers compensation rates and citizenship and immigration requirements  national health care reform legislation passed by the us congress in march and its provisions will require nutritional information labeling on restaurant menus  menu boards  and drive through displays  permit  licensing and other regulatory requirements for the sale of food and beverages  health  safety and fire regulations  zoning  land and environmental regulations  a variety of federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge  emission and disposal of hazardous materials  sales tax  new and changing laws and regulations relating to gift cards  food safety regulations governing the manufacture including composition and ingredients  labeling  packaging and safety of food in the united states and canada  and laws governing public access and employment for people with disabilities 
in march  the president signed the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education affordability reconciliation act of health care reform acts 
although we are preparing for and have developed business processes to deal with and mitigate the costs  which may result in significant modifications to our employment and benefits policies and practices  we cannot predict with certainty the financial and operational impacts the new law will have on us 
we do expect that our expenses will increase as a result of the new law 
any such increases could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  such modifications to our business practices may be disruptive to our operations and impact our ability to attract and retain personnel 
the effect of material changes to healthcare laws in the united states may significantly increase our healthcare costs and negatively impact our financial results 
we offer eligible us employees the opportunity to enroll in healthcare coverage subsidized by us 
for various reasons  many of our eligible employees currently choose not to participate in our healthcare plans 
however  changes to the us healthcare laws that become effective in may lead some eligible employees who currently do not participate in our healthcare plans to enroll for coverage 
such changes in the law include the imposition of a penalty on an individual who does not obtain healthcare coverage and provisions making certain individuals who can obtain employer coverage ineligible for healthcare premium tax subsidies that would otherwise be available in connection with the purchase of coverage through an exchange 
if a significant number of eligible employees who do not currently participate in our healthcare plans  or who currently participate in our lower cost limited coverage plan  choose to enroll once the changes in law come into effect  our healthcare costs may increase significantly and negatively impact our financial results 
legislation and regulations requiring the display and provision of nutritional information for our menu offerings in our restaurants could increase our operating costs  affect consumer preferences  increase the likelihood of litigation  and negatively impact our results of operations 
we are concerned about regulations requiring restaurants to provide calorie and other nutritional information on menus and or in our restaurants 
some of our bob evans restaurants are already subject to state menu labeling laws 
the health care reform acts contain provisions that require restaurants with or more locations to post calorie information on menus and additional nutritional information in writing at the restaurant 
the fda released proposed regulations implementing this legislation on april  the fda was expected to release final regulations prior to december   but did not  and no release date is currently set 
the final regulations will specify when the fda will commence enforcement of the final regulations which is expected to be between six months to one year after publication 
although the new federal legislation preempts the legislation already enacted in california  montgomery county  maryland  and other state and local jurisdictions eg  maine  massachusetts  new jersey  oregon  new york city and philadelphia  some of these jurisdictions are requiring compliance with their regulations until the fda begins enforcing the federal regulations 
menu labeling regulations could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition due to the potential impact on our sales and profitability if the disclosures change guest preferences and menu mix  as well as increased operating costs incurred to comply with these regulations 
moreover  we could become subject to litigation arising from our nutritional disclosures  such as claims that our nutritional disclosures are inaccurate or that our menu offerings are harmful to human health 
health concerns and government regulations relating to the consumption of trans fats  pork  beef  chicken and other food products could affect consumer preferences and could negatively impact our results of operations 
consumer food preferences could be affected by health concerns regarding the consumption of various types of food  such as trans fats  pork  beef or chicken 
while we have eliminated all artificial and synthetic trans fats from our restaurant menu offerings and our food products  some foods  such as bacon  naturally contain trans fats 
some government authorities have proposed increasing regulations regarding naturally occurring trans fats and sodium 
these regulations could  if adopted  require us to limit naturally occurring trans fats or sodium amounts in our menu offerings and or food products in the future 
this could require us to switch to higher cost ingredients  stop offering certain products  or could hinder our ability to operate in certain markets 
negative publicity concerning mad cow and foot and mouth disease relating to the consumption of beef and other meat products  hn or swine flu related to pork products  hn and hn avian or bird flu related to poultry products  and the publication of government  academic or industry findings about health concerns relating to menu items served by any of our restaurants could also affect consumer food preferences 
these types of health concerns and negative publicity concerning our food products may adversely affect the demand for our food and negatively impact our business and results of operations 
our business could suffer if we are the subject of increased litigation regarding personal injuries suffered on our premises  discrimination  harassment or other labor matters 
employee and customer claims against us based on  among other things  personal injury  discrimination  harassment  wage and hour disputes or wrongful termination may divert our financial and management resources from operating our businesses 
restaurant companies have been the target of class actions and other lawsuits alleging  among other things  violation of federal and state law 
like many employers  we have been faced with allegations of purported class wide labor violations in ohio  and we have taken charges related to the settlement of these cases 
an unfavorable verdict or a significant settlement in a future class action lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  cash flows and results of operations 
changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb or other standard setting bodies may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the fasb  the aicpa and other accounting standard setting bodies may periodically issue changes to  interpretations of or guidance with respect to gaap 
the adoption of such guidance may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
iv 
other economic conditions in the united states have adversely impacted our business and financial results in fiscal  and uncertainty regarding the economic recovery could have a material adverse effect on us in the future 
the restaurant and food products industry is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending 
the economic downturn in the united states and uncertainty regarding the economic recovery has reduced consumer confidence impacting the public s ability and desire to spend discretionary dollars  resulting in lower levels of guest traffic in our restaurants and sales of our food products 
when gasoline  natural gas  electricity and other energy costs increase  and credit card  home mortgage and other borrowing costs increase  our guests and customers may have less disposable income and reduce the frequency with which they dine out or purchase our products 
although there has been some improvement in certain economic indicators  recent reports indicate that consumer uncertainty may persist during and beyond  so our ability to increase sales may be negatively impacted in the future 
if this difficult economic situation continues for a prolonged period of time or deepens in magnitude  our business and results of operation could be materially and adversely affected  and our customers may continue to remain apprehensive about the economy and maintain or further reduce their already lowered level of discretionary spending 
this will result in spreading fixed costs across a lower level of sales  and will  in turn cause downward pressure on our profitability 
this could result in restaurant or plant closures and asset impairment charges 
a privacy breach could adversely affect our business 
the protection of customer  employee and company data is critical to us 
the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding  with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements 
compliance with these requirements may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new administrative processes 
in addition  customers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information 
if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a significant breach of customer  employee or company data  our reputation could be damaged and we could experience lost sales  fines or lawsuits 
failure to comply with laws  regulations and third party contracts regarding the collection  maintenance and processing of information may result in adverse publicity and adversely affect the operation of our business and results of operations 
we collect  maintain and process certain information about customers and employees 
our use and protection of this information is regulated by various laws and regulations  as well as by third party contracts 
if our systems or employees fail to comply with these laws  regulations or contract terms  it could require us to notify customers  employees or other groups  resulting in adverse publicity  loss of sales and profits  increased fees payable to third parties  and penalties or remediation and other costs that could adversely affect the operation of our business and results of operations 
inappropriate use of social media vehicles presents new risks 
the inappropriate use of certain media vehicles could cause brand damage or information leakage or could lead to legal implications from the improper collection of personal information 
negative posts or comments about us on any social networking web site could seriously damage our reputation 
in addition  the disclosure of non public company sensitive information through external media channels could lead to information loss as there might not be structured processes in place to secure and archive this information 
identifying new points of entry as social media continues to expand presents new challenges 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to a variety of other factors  resulting in a decline in our stock price 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly because of several factors  including fluctuations in food and commodity prices  including sow costs  the timing of new restaurant openings and related expenses  restaurant operating costs for our newly opened restaurants  which are often materially greater during the first several months of operation  inability to reduce corporate costs currently supporting operations of mimi s caf  labor availability and costs for hourly and management personnel  profitability of our restaurants  especially in new markets  impairments of long term assets  trends in same store sales  adverse weather conditions  special items  such as property sales  local and national economic conditions  including gasoline and other energy costs  and changes in consumer preferences and competitive conditions 
our restaurant and our bef foods business segments are also subject to seasonal fluctuations 
as a result  our quarterly and annual operating results  same store sales and comparable food products sales may fluctuate significantly as a result of seasonality and the factors discussed above 
accordingly  results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any fiscal year 
if our quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to the factors discussed above  this could result in a decline in our stock price 
many factors  including those over which we have no control  affect the trading price of our stock 
factors such as reports on the economy or the price of commodities  as well as negative or positive announcements by competitors  regardless of whether the report relates directly to our business  could have an impact on the trading price of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock may also be affected by stock market conditions  including price and trading fluctuations on the nasdaq stock market  the new york stock exchange or other exchanges 
in addition to investor expectations about our prospects  trading activity in our common stock can reflect the portfolio strategies and investment allocation changes of institutional holders  as well as non operating initiatives such as share repurchase programs 
any failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance  particularly with respect to comparable restaurant sales  revenues  operating margins and earnings per share  would likely cause our stock price to decline 
disruptions in the financial markets may adversely impact the availability and cost of credit and consumer spending patterns 
our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt and to obtain financing for general corporate purposes will depend on our operating and financial performance which  in turn  is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors beyond our control 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to arrange credit on terms we believe are acceptable or that permit us to finance our business with historical margins 
these events have also adversely affected the us and world economy  and any new or continuing disruptions in the financial markets may also adversely affect the us and world economy  which could negatively impact consumer spending patterns 
there can be no assurances that various us and world government responses to the disruptions in the financial markets in the near future will restore consumer confidence  stabilize the markets  or increase liquidity or the availability of credit 
there can be no assurances as to how or when this unprecedented period of turmoil will be resolved 
restrictive covenants in our debt instruments could restrict or prohibit our ability to engage in or enter into a variety of transactions  which could adversely affect us 
our credit facility contains various covenants that limit  among other things  our ability to incur liens on our assets  merge or consolidate with other entities  transfer or sell a substantial part of our assets  substantially change the nature of our business  and enter into transactions with affiliates 
the covenants contained in our credit facility could have a material adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing  merger  acquisition or other corporate opportunities  to fund our business operations or to successfully implement our current and future operating strategies 
a breach of a covenant in our debt instruments could cause acceleration of a significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness 
a breach of a covenant or other provision in any debt instrument governing our current or future indebtedness could result in a default under that instrument and  due to cross default and cross acceleration provisions  could result in a default under our other debt instruments 
in addition  the agreements governing our credit facility require us to maintain certain financial ratios 
our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control such as uncertainties related to the current economy  and we cannot be sure that we will be able to comply with these covenants at all times in the future 
upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our debt instruments  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit 
if the lenders under our current or future indebtedness accelerate the payment of the indebtedness  we cannot be sure that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full our outstanding indebtedness 
our failure or inability to enforce our trademarks or other proprietary rights could adversely affect our competitive position or the value of our brand 
we believe that our trademarks  service marks and other proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position 
our primary trademarks  bob evans and owens  are key components of our operating and marketing strategies 
as a result  we devote appropriate resources to the protection of our trademarks and other proprietary rights 
the protective actions that we take  however  may not be sufficient to prevent unauthorized usage or imitation by others  which could harm our image  brand or competitive position and  if we commence litigation to enforce our rights  could cause us to incur significant legal costs 
in addition  third parties might claim that our trademarks or menu offerings infringe upon their proprietary rights 
any such claim  whether or not it has merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause delays in introducing new menu items or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
as a result  any such claim could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
as a result of the provisions of the membership interest purchase agreement dated january   pursuant to which the sale of the mimi s caf restaurant chain was sold  we may incur expenses for liabilities we retained and indemnification we provided to the buyer  and we may not receive all or part of the purchase price evidenced by the million promissory note from the buyer 
as part of the terms of the membership interest purchase agreement dated january   pursuant to which we sold the mimi s caf restaurant chain  we retained certain liabilities for the presale operations of the mimi s caf restaurant chain  including potential claims and most existing litigation  as well as agreeing to indemnify the buyer against the costs of the same 
because of this we are likely to incur expenses for such claims and liabilities related to periods up to the date of sale 
part of the consideration received was a promissory note 
the promissory note has a principal balance of million  an annual interest rate of  and a term of seven years 
the note is payable at maturity 
partial prepayments are required prior to maturity if the buyer reaches certain levels of ebitda during specified periods  or upon a sale or liquidation 
the buyer covenanted to provide funding of at least million through the initial months after closing 
to the extent of such capital being funded but not repaid  we agreed to subordinate our right to repayment under the note until the buyer has first received a repayment of its funding 
the note is subordinated to third party lenders 
because the maker of the note is a newly formed entity with limited capital  if the mimi s caf restaurant chain should have limited profitability or losses  the likelihood that the note would be paid in full is uncertain 
our current insurance loss estimates may not be adequate and  if claims exceed such estimates  it could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
we are self insured for a significant portion of our current exposures related to our workers compensation  general liabilities and employee health insurance programs 
although we base our loss estimates on actuarial data  as well as on our historical trends  we may not be able to accurately predict the number or value of the claims that occur 
in particular  health insurance costs have increased significantly over the last years 
in the event that our actual liability exceeds our estimate for any given period  or if we are unable to control rapidly increasing health care costs  there could be a material adverse effect on our level of profitability 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as delaware law  may have anti takeover effects 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a merger  tender offer or proxy contest  which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  certain provisions of delaware law applicable to us could also delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving our company  including section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested shareholder as defined in the statute for a period of three years unless certain conditions are met 
in addition  our senior management is entitled to certain payments and rights upon a change in control of our company 
our business could be negatively affected as a result of a proxy fight and the actions of activist shareholders 
if we became engaged in a proxy contest with an activist shareholder in the future  our business could be adversely affected because responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders can disrupt our operations  be costly and time consuming  and divert the attention of our senior management  perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities  and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners  and  if individuals are elected to our board of directors with a specific agenda  it may adversely affect our ability to effectively implement our business strategy and create additional value for our shareholders

bob evans farms  inc overview fiscal was a year of tremendous change for bob evans farms  inc the company took many significant strategic actions during fiscal that impacted profitability including the conversion of the restaurant operating entities to limited liability companies  the sale of mimi s caf  initiation of the consolidation of ready to eat production at the sulphur springs  texas  facility  the acquisition of kettle creations  the early payment of the company s private placement notes  the sale and leaseback of the corporate campus and other facilities  and other restructuring activities 
these activities resulted in a negative net pretax operating loss of million  and million of costs in interest expense associated with the prepayment of the company s private placement notes  resulting in a pretax charge totaling million 
the pretax loss for fiscal was million 
income taxes were a benefit of million  primarily reflecting the income tax receivable the company expects to realize from converting its restaurant operating entities to limited liability company structures 
loss per share for fiscal was 
the company does not expect restructuring and other corporate strategic actions to continue at this level in fiscal bob evans restaurants segment overview the factors that had the greatest positive impact on bob evans restaurants performance in fiscal were the effect of our farm fresh refresh remodeling initiative  pricing and improvements in same store sales trends  which were offset by commodity cost increases  impairment on underperforming restaurants and nonoperating property  plant and equipment  increases in the employer match to the company s retirement plans  long term incentive plans expense and wages and severance payments 
in fiscal  same store sales increased percent compared to fiscal our same store sales improved despite an incremental lost sales days from the farm fresh refresh remodel initiative 
closed store days reached more than  in fiscal we experienced positive same store sales in each of our fiscal quarters largely due to our continued strong performance of the restaurants that have been remodeled as part of our farm fresh refresh remodeling initiative 
average guest check increased to compared to in fiscal as a result of guest acceptance of our marketing and menu initiatives including our value meal offerings 
off premise as a percent of overall sales continued to increase and now represents percent of net sales compared to percent last year 
in fiscal  operating income decreased million  or percent  compared to the corresponding period last year 
the decrease in operating income is largely a result of increases in depreciation expense and s  g a expenses which include impairment costs and severance and restructuring 
additionally  the increase in s  g a expenses was due to employer match to the company s retirement plans  long term incentive plans expense  legal fees  increased utilization of contract labor  wages  an increased corporate overhead allocation as a result of the company s sale of mimi s caf  which included providing transition services to mimi s caf at less than cost  and spending to implement an enterprise resource plan erp computer system 
the increase in depreciation expense is primarily related to substantial capital improvements made as part of the farm fresh refresh remodel initiative 
at bob evans restaurants  sales growth is being driven by the farm fresh refresh remodel initiative  in conjunction with value messaging  menu innovation  bakery and the off premise sales layers 
in fiscal  we completed farm fresh refresh remodels at bob evans restaurants 
the sales increase provided by the farm fresh refresh initiative is largely due to improving the dine in experience while also adding the new bakery sales layer and enhancing the restaurants ability to support carryout and catering

our acquisition of kettle creations early in the second quarter of fiscal  contributed percentage points of the total pounds sold increase 
the acquisition of the kettle creations brand and its food production facility helps us to support the rapid growth of our side dish business 
we are in the process of expanding the kettle creations food production facility  as well as our plant in sulphur springs  texas  to respond to growth in sales of our portfolio of refrigerated side dishes  precooked sausage and frozen breakfast offerings

provision for income taxes the effective federal and state income tax rates were percent and percent in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal reflects the impact of settlements with certain taxing authorities and the reduction of reserves for prior uncertain tax positions of prior fiscal years 
liquidity and capital resources cash generated from operations in the bob evans restaurants  mimi s caf and bef foods segments and draws on our credit facility were the main sources of funds to pay off our private placement debt  fund our farm fresh refresh remodeling initiative and other capital investments  pay cash consideration for the kettle creations acquisition  repurchase shares and pay cash dividends 
cash and equivalents totaled million at april  operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for fiscal and fiscal respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities year over year was due primarily to the net loss  impacted by the impairment of assets held for sale  the loss on sale of mimi s caf and the increase in the federal and state income tax assets 
the increase in current federal and state income tax assets is a result of two major factors one  favorable permanent tax impact of a corporate conversion implemented during the third quarter of fiscal whereby swh corporation  a california corporation  was converted from a corporation to a limited liability companies and two  the reduction of book income for the impairment of mimi s caf 
investing activities cash used in investing activities was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase was due to the acquisition of kettle creations and an increase in capital expenditures  partially offset by proceeds from the sale of mimi s caf and property  plant and equipment 
capital expenditures consist primarily of our farm fresh refresh remodeling initiative and new restaurants  production plant improvements  new corporate campus  and other purchases of new and replacement furniture and equipment 
capital expenditures incurred and paid were and million for fiscal  compared to million in the corresponding period last year 
the increase in our capital expenditures is mainly due to our farm fresh refresh remodeling initiative at bob evans restaurants  along with other property  plant and equipment additions at bef foods 
due to the continued success of the farm fresh refresh remodeling initiative  we have decided to remodel all bob evans restaurants by the end of fiscal year we expect to begin our new restaurant opening program in fiscal with an evolved design and upgraded site selection process intended to drive average unit volumes in excess of our current average unit volume 
we expect capital spending to be between and million for fiscal the increase in expected capital expenditures in fiscal is due to completing our farm fresh refresh remodeling initiative  capacity expansion for bef foods  completion of the new corporate campus and the initial implementation of a new erp 
financing activities cash used in financing activities was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in uses in financing activities was due primarily to the net increase in the credit facility  partially offset by the prepayment of our private placement debt 
as of december   we had outstanding a note purchase agreement  dated july   as amended  and a note purchase agreement  dated july   as amended  in the total amount of million collectively  the private placement notes 
on december   we prepaid all amounts outstanding under the private placement notes consisting of million in aggregate principal amount  plus make whole amounts of approximately million determined in accordance with the provisions of the private placement debt 
we completed the refinancing of a new million credit facility in the third quarter of fiscal under the terms of the credit agreement  we increased the aggregate amount of borrowings by million  increasing our credit facility to million 
as of april   million was drawn  million is reserved for certain standby letters of credit  and the remaining million of our credit facility is available for liquidity needs  capital expansion and repurchases of bob evans common stock and payment of dividends 
the funds from the credit facility were used to pay off our private placement debt  fund our farm fresh refresh remodeling initiative and other capital investments  repurchase our shares  pay the cash consideration for the kettle creations acquisition and pay dividends 
our interest expense on variable rate debt will increase in future periods as the credit facility funding source is utilized 
as of april   we were in compliance with our debt covenants and restrictions 
on august   we obtained an interest free loan from a municipality of million  due ten years from the date of borrowing and with no prepayment penalty 
the loan is intended to assist with the construction costs of the new corporate building 
during fiscal  we repurchased million shares of our outstanding common stock for a total of million 
on november   the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to million  million of which was allocated to open market or privately purchased shares of common stock pursuant to a rule b plan starting immediately  and million of which was allocated to a rule b nondiscretionary trading program b program 
the b program began on december   and was cancelled on february  on february   the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to million 
this program began on march  the plan terminated on april   when the authorized funds were expended 
the program authorized bob evans to repurchase its outstanding common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
we believe that our cash flow from operations  as well as our credit facility  will be sufficient to fund future capital expenditures  working capital requirements  debt repayments  dividend payments and share repurchases 
on june   the board of directors approved a million stock repurchase program to begin on july   and terminating at the earlier of the time all authorized funds are expended  or december  the company entered into a b plan for the purchase of the shares under the repurchase program 
in may  our board of directors authorized a quarterly cash dividend of per share on our outstanding common stock with a record date of june   and a payment date of june  our annual dividend rate for fiscal was  compared to in fiscal future payments of our contractual obligations and outstanding indebtedness as of april   are as follows contractual obligations total year and less years years after years operating leases long term debt purchase obligations the provisions of our deferred compensation plans do not provide for specific payment dates 
therefore  our obligations under these plans were excluded from this table 
our deferred compensation obligations of million were included in the consolidated balance sheets at april   as part of long term liabilities 
the balance does not include interest  as this debt is interest free 
we have imputed interest based on our current borrowing rate 
we believe that funds needed for capital expenditures  working capital and share repurchases during fiscal will be generated from both operations and available bank lines of credit 
we will evaluate additional financing alternatives as warranted 
as of april   we had contractual commitments of approximately million for the purchase of inventory  plant additions  development of an erp system  the construction of a new corporate headquarters and restaurant construction 
the amounts of other contingent commercial commitments by expiration period as of april   are as follows amount of commitment expiration per period other commercial commitments total year and less years years after years standby letters of credit lines of credit total other commercial commitments business outlook our outlook for fiscal relies on a number of assumptions  as well as the risk factors included in our sec filings 
we anticipate consolidated net sales to approximate billion in fiscal we are projecting net interest expense of approximately to million for fiscal we estimate that our effective tax rate will approximate percent to percent for all of fiscal we project weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be approximately million shares for fiscal year in fiscal  we expect capital expenditures to approximate million to million 
the estimated expenditures include completing the farm fresh refresh remodel initiative with remaining restaurants  opening up to four new bob evans restaurants  finalizing the expansion of the bef foods plant in sulphur springs  texas  and the kettle creations facility in lima  ohio  the completion of the new corporate campus  and the erp implementation 
our capital spending was million in fiscal depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal should approximate to million 
we expect bob evans restaurants to experience a full year same store sales increase between percent and percent  driven by the sales increase from farm fresh refresh remodels and value platforms offset partially by incremental closed store days 
in bob evans restaurants  we expect an adjusted operating margin of approximately percent to percent 
in fiscal  bob evans restaurants expects to incur an additional million related to preopening expenses for farm fresh refresh remodel activity and new restaurant development 
in the bef foods segment  we expect overall net sales of to million for the full fiscal year  driven by new product introductions and distribution gains in both retail and foodservice 
we anticipate that sow costs will average approximately to per hundredweight in fiscal for the full year 
we expect bef foods fiscal operating income margin to be approximately percent to percent 
we expect bef foods operating income to reflect the impact of erp spending and an increased corporate overhead allocation as the result of the company providing transition services to mimi s caf at less than cost  as well as the additional production expected to begin at the newly expanded kettle creations and sulphur springs plants at the end of the second quarter of fiscal critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions  based on our experience and current understanding of the facts and circumstances  which affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
our significant accounting policies are described more fully in note certain significant accounting policies require complex and subjective judgment as a result of estimates surrounding uncertain outcomes 
while we believe that our historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  the judgments surrounding these critical accounting policies may result in materially different amounts under different financial conditions or by using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized for bob evans restaurants and mimi s caf at the point of sale  other than revenue from the sale of gift cards  which is deferred and recognized upon redemption 
we issue gift cards  which do not have expiration dates or inactivity fees 
we recognize revenue from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer 
in addition  we recognize income on unredeemed gift cards gift card breakage based on historical sales and redemption patterns  referred to as the redemption recognition method 
gift card breakage is recognized proportionately over the period of redemption in net sales of our bob evans restaurants and mimi s caf segments in the consolidated statements of income 
the liability for unredeemed gift cards is included in deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets 
we review our gift card breakage rates and rate of redemption periodically to ensure our estimates are reasonable 
if actual redemption patterns differ from our estimates  actual gift card breakage amounts may vary from the amounts recorded 
a change in our gift card breakage estimate of percent would result in a change to our net sales of approximately million 
we also produce and distribute pork sausage products and a variety of complementary home style convenience food items under the bob evans and owens brand names in our bef foods segment 
these food products are distributed primarily to warehouses that distribute to grocery stores throughout the united states 
revenue in the bef foods segment is generally recognized when products are received by our customers 
we engage in promotional sales incentive programs in the form of off invoice deductions  billbacks  cooperative advertising and coupons with our customers 
costs associated with these programs are classified as a reduction of net sales in the period in which the sale occurs 
our promotions may fluctuate based on sow costs trends and during peak holiday periods 
as a result  we enter into promotion agreements with our customers during distinct time periods where we expect to maximize the impact of promotions on net sales through increased volume when sow costs trends are expected to be favorable 
a change in actual sales volume and sow costs from our estimates will impact sales  and ultimately  profitability of the bef foods segment 
all revenue is presented net of sales tax 
long lived asset impairment we evaluate property  plant and equipment held and used in the business for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
impairment is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted future operating cash flows for the asset group to the carrying amount of its assets 
if impairment exists  the amount of impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated discounted future operating cash flows of the asset and the expected proceeds from the sale of the asset  in accordance with the property  plant and equipment topic of the fasb asc 
we estimated the fair value based on appraisals  which we deemed to be level inputs under the fair value measurements and disclosures topic of the fasb asc 
indicators of impairments in the bob evans restaurants segment are a result of underperforming restaurants and nonoperating property  plant and equipment locations 
assumptions used to calculate impairment of long lived assets are dependent on factors such as useful lives of long lived assets  expected operating performance  undiscounted future operating cash flows and desirability of our location 
a change to any of these factors may alter our long lived asset impairment and adversely impact our consolidated statements of income 
during fiscal year and fiscal year  we recognized long lived asset impairments in our bob evans restaurants segment of million and million  respectively 
during fiscal year and fiscal year  we recognized long lived asset impairment in our mimi s caf segment of million and million  respectively 
we did not recognize any long lived asset impairment in our bef foods segment in fiscal and recognized million in fiscal additionally  we had an indicator of impairment as a result of our definitive agreement to sell the mimi s caf segment to le duff america  inc for million 
we performed a recoverability test and determined that undiscounted cash flows of the long lived asset group were less than the carrying amount of the long lived asset group 
based on our market approached valuation  we determined that the asset group s then current carrying value exceeded its fair value  which resulted in a pretax impairment charge related to the business trade name of million in the mimi s caf segment in the third quarter of fiscal goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill  which represents the cost in excess of fair market value of net assets acquired  is not amortized  rather it is tested annually for impairment or on a more frequent basis if there is an indicator of impairment 
we have million in goodwill in our bef foods segment 
in our bef foods segment  other intangible assets represent a trade name and non compete agreement of million and million  respectively 
the non compete agreement is a definite lived intangible asset and is amortized over the term of the agreement 
the goodwill and other intangible impairment test is a two step process 
the first step is a comparison of each segment s fair value to its carrying value 
we estimate fair value using the best information available  including market information and discounted cash flow projections also referred to as market value approach 
a market approach estimates fair value by applying cash flow and sales multiples to the reporting unit s operating performance 
the multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics of the reporting units 
the projection uses management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in sales  costs and number of units  estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures 
other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates  future estimates of capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements 
if the fair value of the segment is higher than its carrying value  goodwill and other intangibles are deemed not to be impaired  and no further testing is required 
if the carrying value of the segment is higher than its fair value  there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
the amount of impairment is determined by comparing the implied fair value of the segment s goodwill and other intangible assets to the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets is less than the recorded value  we would record an impairment loss for the difference 
our assumptions used to calculate impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets are dependent on factors such as expected operating performance  undiscounted future operating cash flows  declines in our stock price and changes to consumer acceptance 
a change to any of these factors may alter our evaluation of goodwill and other intangible asset impairment and adversely impact our consolidated statements of income 
self insurance reserves we record estimates for certain health and welfare  workers compensation and general insurance costs that are self insured programs 
self insurance reserves include actuarial estimates of both claims filed  carried at their expected ultimate settlement value  and claims incurred but not yet reported 
our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
estimates for health and welfare  workers compensation and general liability are calculated utilizing claims development estimates based on historical experience and other factors 
we utilize stop loss insurance to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per person basis for health and welfare and on a per claim basis for workers compensation and general insurance 
a percent increase or decrease to the assumptions for health insurance and workers compensation and general average claims would increase or decrease our self insurance accruals for worker s compensation and health insurance by approximately million and less than million  respectively 
taxes we estimate certain components of our provision for income taxes 
these estimates include  among other items  depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes  allowable tax credits for items such as taxes paid on reported employee tip income and the work opportunity tax credit  effective rates for state and local income taxes  and the tax deductibility of certain other items 
we base our estimates on the best available information at the time that we prepare the provision 
we adjust our annual effective income tax rate as additional information on outcomes or events becomes available 
fasb asc topic  income taxes  requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized or derecognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not ie  a likelihood of more than percent that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
to the extent a tax position does not qualify for recognition  we provide for a reserve in long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
interest and penalties recognized on reserves for uncertain tax positions are included as a component of income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income and the corresponding liability is included in our tax reserve as a long term liability in our consolidated balance sheets 
we provide for federal and state income taxes currently payable as well as for those deferred because of temporary differences between reporting income and expenses for financial statement purposes versus tax purposes 
federal income tax credits are recorded as a reduction of income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date 
we generally file our annual income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
the us federal income tax returns that we filed through the fiscal year ended april   have been closed either through audit by the internal revenue service irs or the expiration of statutes of limitation 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the irs completed the audit of our tax returns for the fiscal year ended april   and april   with no material adjustments 
the company s tax return for the fiscal year ended april   is under audit  and is expected to be completed by the third quarter of fiscal income tax returns are subject to audit by state and local governments  generally no later than three years after the returns are filed 
these returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws 
the major jurisdictions in which the company files income tax returns include the us federal jurisdiction and approximately thirty states in the us the company is no longer subject to us federal income tax examinations by the irs for years before fiscal  and with a few exceptions  state and local  or non us income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not currently use derivative financial instruments for speculative or hedging purposes 
we maintain our cash and cash equivalents in financial instruments with maturities of three months or less when purchased 
at april   our outstanding debt included million outstanding on the credit facility  and million on a long term note 
a change in market interest rates will impact our credit facility when there is an outstanding balance 
for example  a percent increase in the benchmark rate used for our credit facility would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million  assuming the million outstanding at the end of fiscal was outstanding for the entire year 
we purchase certain commodities such as beef  pork  poultry  seafood  produce and dairy products 
these commodities are generally purchased based upon market prices established with suppliers 
these purchase arrangements may contain contractual features that fix the price paid for certain commodities 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices because these purchase arrangements help control the ultimate cost paid and most commodity price aberrations are generally short term in nature
