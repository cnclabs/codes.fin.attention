overview sonic foundry  inc is a technology leader in the emerging web communications marketplace  providing video content management and distribution for education  business and government 
using the mediasite webcasting platform and webcast services of the company s events team  the company empowers our customers to advance how they share knowledge online  using video webcasts to bridge time and distance  enhance learning outcomes and improve performance 
critical accounting policies we have identified the following as critical accounting policies to our company and have discussed the development  selection of estimates and the disclosure regarding them with the audit committee of the board of directors revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and reserves  impairment of long lived assets  valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets  accounting for stock based compensation  and capitalized software development costs 

table of contents sonic foundry  inc annual report on form k for the year ended september  revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and reserves general revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery occurs or services are rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue is deferred when undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of delivered products  customer acceptance is uncertain  significant obligations remain  or the fair value of undelivered elements is unknown 
the company does not offer customers the right to return product  other than for exchange or repair pursuant to a warranty or stock rotation 
the company s policy is to reduce revenue if it incurs an obligation for price rebates or other such programs during the period the obligation is reasonably estimated to occur 
the following policies apply to the company s major categories of revenue transactions 
products products are considered delivered  and revenue is recognized  when title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer 
under the terms and conditions of the sale  this occurs at the time of shipment to the customer 
product revenue currently represents sales of our mediasite recorders and mediasite related products such as our server software and other software licenses 
if a license is time based  the revenue is recognized over the term of the license agreement 
services the company sells support and content hosting contracts to its customers  typically one year in length  and records the related revenue ratably over the contractual period 
our support contracts cover phone and electronic technical support availability over and above the level provided by our distribution partners  software upgrades on a when and if available basis  advance hardware replacement and an extension of the standard hardware warranty from days to one year 
the manufacturers we contract with to build the units provide a limited one year warranty on the hardware 
we also sell installation  training  event webcasting  and customer content hosting services 
revenue for those services is recognized when performed in the case of installation  training and event webcasting services 
service amounts invoiced to customers in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue until the revenue recognition criteria are met 
revenue arrangements that include multiple elements sales of software  with or without installation  training  and post customer support fall within the scope of the software revenue recognition rules 
under the software revenue recognition rules  the fee from a multiple deliverable arrangement is allocated to each of the undelivered elements based upon vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  which is limited to the price charged when the same deliverable is sold separately  with the residual value from the arrangement allocated to the delivered element 
the portion of the fee that is allocated to each deliverable is then recognized as revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition are met with respect to that deliverable 
if vsoe does not exist for all of the undelivered elements  then all revenue from the arrangement is typically deferred until all elements have been delivered to the customer 
all revenue arrangements  with the exception of hosting contracts  entered into prior to october  and the sale of all software only products and associated services have been accounted for under this guidance 
in the case of the company s hardware products with embedded software  the company has determined that the hardware and software components function together to deliver the product s essential functionality  and therefore  the revenue from the sale of these products is accounted for under the revenue recognition rules for tangible products whereby the fee from a multiple deliverable arrangement is allocated to each of the deliverables based upon their relative selling prices as determined by a selling price hierarchy 
a deliverable in an arrangement qualifies as a separate unit of accounting if the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis 
a delivered item that does not qualify as a separate unit of accounting is combined with the other undelivered items in the arrangement and revenue is recognized for those combined deliverables as a single unit of accounting 
the selling price used for each deliverable is based upon vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not 
table of contents sonic foundry  inc annual report on form k for the year ended september  available  and best estimate of selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe are available 
tpe is the price of the company s or any competitor s largely interchangeable products or services in stand alone sales to similarly situated customers 
esp is the price at which the company would sell the deliverable if it were sold regularly on a stand alone basis  considering market conditions and entity specific factors 
all revenue arrangements negotiated after september   excluding the sale of all software only products and associated services  have been accounted for under this guidance 
the selling prices used in the relative selling price allocation method are as follows the company s products and services are based upon vsoe and hardware products with embedded software  for which vsoe does not exist  are based upon esp 
the company does not believe tpe exists for any of these products and services because they are differentiated from competing products and services in terms of functionality and performance and there are no competing products or services that are largely interchangeable 
management establishes esp for hardware products with embedded software using a cost plus margin approach with consideration for market conditions  such as the impact of competition and geographic considerations  and entity specific factors  such as the cost of the product and the company s profit objectives 
management believes that esp is reflective of reasonable pricing of that deliverable as if priced on a stand alone basis 
when a sales transaction includes deliverables that are divided between asc topic and asc subtopic  the company allocates the selling price using the relative selling price method whereas value is allocated using an esp for software developed using a percent of list price approach 
the other deliverables are valued using esp or vsoe as previously discussed 
while the pricing model  currently in use  captures all critical variables  unforeseen changes due to external market forces may result in a revision of the inputs 
these modifications may result in the consideration allocation differing from the one presently in use 
absent a significant change in the pricing inputs or the way in which the industry structures its deals  future changes in the pricing model are not expected to materially affect our allocation of arrangement consideration 
management has established vsoe for hosting services 
billings for hosting are spread ratably over the term of the hosting agreement  with the typical hosting agreement having a term of months  with renewal on an annual basis 
the company sells most hosting contracts without the inclusion of products 
when the hosting arrangement is sold in conjunction with product  the product revenue is recognized immediately while the remaining hosting revenue is spread ratably over the term of the hosting agreement 
the selling price is allocated between these elements using the relative selling price method 
the company uses esp for development of the selling price for hardware products with embedded software 
the company also offers hosting services bundled with events services 
the company uses vsoe to establish relative selling prices for its events services 
the company recognizes events revenue when the event takes place and recognizes the hosting revenue over the term of the hosting agreement 
the total amount of the arrangement is allocated to each element based on the relative selling price method 
reserves we record reserves for stock rotations  price adjustments  rebates  and sales incentives to reduce revenue and accounts receivable for these and other credits we may grant to customers 
such reserves are recorded at the time of sale and are calculated based on historical information such as rates of product stock rotations and the specific terms of sales programs  taking into account any other known information about likely customer behavior 
if actual customer behavior differs from our expectations  additional reserves may be required 
also  if we determine that we can no longer accurately estimate amounts for stock rotations and sales incentives  we would not be able to recognize revenue until the resellers sell the inventory to the final end user 
credit evaluation and allowance for doubtful accounts we assess the realization of our receivables by performing ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
through these evaluations  we may become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its financial viability  credit ratings or bankruptcy 
our reserve requirements are based on the best facts available to us and are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is 
table of contents sonic foundry  inc annual report on form k for the year ended september  received 
our reserves are also based on amounts determined by using percentages applied to certain aged receivable categories 
these percentages are determined by a variety of factors including  but not limited to  current economic trends  historical payment and bad debt write off experience 
allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable was  at september  and  at september  impairment of long lived assets we assess the impairment of goodwill on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of these assets is less than the carrying value 
in fiscal with the adoption of asu  testing goodwill for impairment  we first assessed qualitative factors related to goodwill to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill test 
the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than percent 
using the qualitative assessment  we determined that the fair value of goodwill is more likely than not greater than its carrying amount thus step two was not deemed necessary to perform 
in fiscal  we performed the two step goodwill test and determined that the fair value of goodwill is more than the carrying value 
the company has recognized no impairment charges as of september  if we had determined that the fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value  based upon the annual test or the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we would have then measured impairment based on a comparison of the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
to the extent the carrying amount of goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of goodwill  we would have recorded an impairment charge for the difference 
long lived assets and intangible assets other than goodwill are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to that asset 
valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities  and are measured using currently enacted tax rates and laws 
deferred income taxes also arise from the future benefits of net operating loss carryforwards 
a valuation allowance equal to of the net deferred tax assets has been recognized due to uncertainty regarding future realization 
accounting for stock based compensation the company uses a lattice valuation model to account for all stock options granted 
the lattice valuation model provides a flexible analysis to value options because of its ability to incorporate inputs that change over time  such as actual exercise behavior of option holders 
the company uses historical data to estimate the option exercise and employee departure behavior in the lattice valuation model 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company s stock 
the company considers all employees to have similar exercise behavior and therefore has not identified separate homogenous groups for valuation 
the expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option pricing model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate for periods the options are expected to be outstanding is based on the us treasury yields in effect at the time of grant 
forfeitures are based on actual behavior patterns 

table of contents sonic foundry  inc annual report on form k for the year ended september  capitalized software development costs software development costs incurred in conjunction with product development are charged to research and development expense until technological feasibility is established 
thereafter  until the product is released for sale  software development costs are capitalized and reported at the net realizable value of the related product 
typically the period between achieving technological feasibility of the company s products and the general availability of the products has been short 
consequently  software development costs qualifying for capitalization are typically immaterial and are generally expensed to research and development costs 
during  the company s my mediasite product release required software capitalization since there was a longer period between technological feasibility and the general availability of the product and the development costs were material 
upon product release  the amortization of software development costs is determined annually as the greater of the amount computed using the ratio of current gross revenues for the products to their total of current and anticipated future gross revenues or the straight line method over the estimated economic life of the products  expected to be three years 
amortization expense of software development costs of thousand at september  is included in cost of revenue product 
the amount of capitalized external and internal development costs is thousand for the year ended september  there were no development costs capitalized in period ended september  recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued asu  income taxes topic presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward  a similar tax loss  or a tax credit carryforward exists 
the amendments in this asu provide guidance for the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward  a similar tax loss  or a tax credit carryforward exists 
the amendments in this asu are expected to reduce diversity in practice by providing guidance on the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits and will better reflect the manner in which an entity would settle at the reporting date any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position when net operating loss carryforwards  similar tax losses  or tax credit carryforwards exist 
this update is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have an impact on the company 
accounting standards that have been issued but are not yet effective by the fasb or other standards setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements upon adoption

other revenue relates to freight charges billed separately to our customers 
gross margin total gross margin in fiscal was million or compared to million or in fiscal gross margin was positively affected by operational efficiencies in recorder and services costs and a decrease in direct and outsourced event labor costs with lower markups for services which the company does not provide  such as closed captioning
