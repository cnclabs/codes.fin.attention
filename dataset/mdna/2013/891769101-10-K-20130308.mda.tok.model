item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
introduction the following discussion presents management s discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the company as of december  and and for the years ended december   and this discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview net income was million in compared to net income of million in the decrease of  was a direct result of the reversal of the state valuation allowance in december of  which resulted in a tax benefit of million in compared to tax expense of million in income before taxes increased by million in compared to as a result of a decrease in provision expenses by million  an increase in noninterest income of  and a decrease of  in noninterest expense 
these increases to earnings were offset by a decrease of  in net interest income 
net interest income decreased from to due a decrease in average assets of million coupled with declines in loan and investment yields from and in to and in  respectively 
in  we continued to see our loan balances decrease  but we were able to offset this loss of earning assets through purchasing long term investments towards the end of the year 
to combat net interest margin compression  we successfully repositioned our deposit portfolio from higher cost time deposits to lower cost core deposits  such as interest bearing checking accounts 
also contributing to the decrease in interest expense was the decrease in our trust preferred debt securities interest rate in the first quarter of  as the remaining million of the million is now on a floating rate based on three month libor 
the weighted average rate on the trust preferred debt securities decreased from in to in additionally in to minimize the loss of net interest income  we implemented a municipal bond leverage strategy  which resulted in purchasing mm of longer term muni bonds that were match funded by brokered deposits with similar maturities 
while this strategy will cause our net interest margin to compress going forward  it will further supplement net interest income during this prolonged period of low interest rates 
non interest income increased by  in compared to as a result of increases of  and  in mortgage banking income and trust and brokerage income  respectively 
also adding to the increase in noninterest income during was the decrease in other than temporary impairment on available for sale securities of  offsetting these increases was a decrease of  in gains on the sale of securities 
provision expense decreased in from by million as a result of an improvement in overall asset quality  specifically through a reduction in net charge offs from million in to million in and a reduction in loans identified as special mention  substandard  or doubtful from december  to december noninterest expenses decreased by  primarily as a result of a decrease in fdic insurance premiums and other real estate owned oreo expenses by  and  respectively 
offsetting these decreases were increases in salaries and benefits  data processing  and occupancy and equipment by   and  respectively 
fdic insurance premiums decreased in due to the termination of our written agreement with the federal reserve and idfi 
oreo expenses decreased as a result of fewer write downs to fair value by  in compared to the decrease in oreo balances through sales of  in caused the decrease in legal and maintenance expenses associated with these properties and recorded in the oreo expense category 
the increase in salaries and benefits was driven by the increase in commission expense offset by a reduction in stock compensation expense 
data processing expense increased as a result of the addition of non recurring projects related to our core system that will create efficiency and enhance revenue  an increase in the number of accounts outstanding  and a reallocation of expenses from other expense related to processing of debit cards 
occupancy and equipment expenses increased as a result of an increase in assessed property values on all branches located in allen county 
income taxes increased million from due to a tax benefit created in from reversing the valuation allowances on both our state book to tax timing differences and our state net operating losses 
the reversal was a result of the liquidation of our nevada investment subsidiary in september  when it became more likely than not that we will be able to realize these items over the next few years  which will be well within the carryforward period 
total assets decreased million  or  from the prior year 
the primary reasons for the difference year over year were decreases of million in cash and cash equivalents and total loans of million  offset by an increase in long term investments of million 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was due to two customers depositing approximately million temporarily in december as expected  these funds departed during the first quarter of  which was the purpose for keeping these funds liquid and holding them in cash and cash equivalents at december  in an attempt to preserve net interest income during this prolonged period of low interest rates  we implemented a municipal bond leverage strategy during the fourth quarter of that resulted in purchasing approximately million in municipal bonds match funded by brokered deposits with similar maturities  which is approximately ten years 
this strategy will add approximately  to our net interest income each year going forward  but will cause a decrease in our net interest margin 
the decrease in loans was driven by decreases in commercial loans of million  commercial real estate loans of million  and consumer loans of million 
total deposits at december  were million compared to million at december  as described above  we received two large  short term  deposits of approximately million in december that increased our deposit totals 
therefore  our adjusted deposits at december  were approximately million 
excluding these short term deposits  our deposit portfolio increased by approximately million during interest bearing checking accounts increased by million  the result of increases of million in our health savings accounts hsa and the movement of approximately million of noninterest bearing account balances to our new interest bearing checking account for commercial customers 
as a result of this movement between accounts and the departure of the short term deposits discussed above  noninterest bearing accounts decreased million from december  other categories reporting declines in balances during the year include in market cd s of million  brokered certificates of deposit of million  and money market accounts of million 
hsa continue to be a high growth  low cost product for us which is reflected by the continued increase in balances of million in  million in  and million in as of december   we had over  active health savings accounts and we expect to receive another large deposit of approximately million in january into these accounts when our customers typically make their annual employer contributions 
the continued increase in hsa boosted our core deposits to total deposits ratio to in from in total equity increased by million as a result of million of net income offset by the repurchase of shares of the company s common stock of million and dividends paid to stockholders of million 
in the third quarter of  we were released from our written agreement with the federal reserve and idfi  which enabled us to pay two quarterly dividends in the amount of each and one special dividend in the amount of 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note summary of significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this report 
allowance for loan losses 
our allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
additions to the allowance may result from recording provision for loan losses and recoveries  while charge offs are deducted from the allowance 
allocation of the allowance is made for analytical purposes only  and the entire allowance is available to absorb any loan charged off 
we have an established process for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that relies on various procedures and pieces of information to arrive at a range of probable outcomes 
no single statistic or measurement  in itself  determines the adequacy of the allowance 
the allowance has two components identified specific allocations and a percentage allocation based on loss history for different loan groups 
to determine the allocated component of the allowance  we combine estimated allowances required for specifically identified loans that are analyzed individually and loans that are analyzed on a group basis 
first  management allocates specific portions of the allowance for loan losses based on identifiable problem loans 
problem loans are identified through a loan risk rating system and monitored through watch list reporting 
the amount of impairment  or specific reserve  is calculated by using the present value of expected cash flows or the fair value of the underlying collateral less cost to sell as required by asc second  management s evaluation of the allowance for different loan groups is based on consideration of actual loss experience  the present and prospective financial condition of our borrowers  industry concentrations within the loan portfolio and general economic conditions 
lastly  the unallocated component of the allowance is maintained to supplement the allocated component and to recognize the imprecision of estimating and measuring loss when evaluating loss allocations for individual loans or pools of loans 
the allocated and the unallocated components represent the total allowance for loan losses that under normal circumstances should adequately cover probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
actual loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that a loan or a portion thereof is uncollectible 
a loan is impaired when full payment under the loan terms is not expected 
impairment is evaluated in the aggregate for smaller balance loans of a similar nature such as residential mortgage and consumer loans  and on an individual loan basis for other loans 
commercial loans and mortgage loans secured by other properties are evaluated individually for impairment 
when analysis of a borrower operating results and financial condition indicates that underlying cash flows of the borrower business are not adequate to meet its debt service requirements  the loan is evaluated for impairment 
if a loan is impaired  a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported  net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan existing interest rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
there are many factors affecting judgment calls relating to allowances for loan losses 
some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment 
although we believe our process for determining the allowance adequately considers all of the factors that could potentially result in credit losses  the process includes subjective elements and may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provision for loan losses could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
results of operations summary net income was million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  while this was a decrease of  from the prior year  approximately million of the decrease was the result of recording tax expense of million in compared to a tax benefit of million in when comparing income before tax  we experienced an increase of million from to this improvement from was the result of a decrease in provision expense of million  a decrease in noninterest expense of  and an increase in noninterest income by  these increases to earnings were offset by a decrease in net interest income of  net interest income decreased from the prior year due to decreases in loan and investment yields coupled with a decrease in average earning assets 
provision expense decreased by million as a result of improvement in asset quality from to noninterest income increased  as a result of an increase in trust and brokerage income  an increase in mortgage banking income  and a decrease on the impairment of available for sale securities 
noninterest expense decreased as a result of savings in both fdic insurance premiums and oreo expenses 
income tax expense increased by million as a result of reversing the state valuation allowance on our state deferred tax asset and our deferred timing differences  which resulted in a tax benefit of million in net interest income net interest income  the difference between revenue generated from earning assets and the interest cost of funding those assets  is our primary source of earnings 
while net interest income only declined  or  to million and the net interest margin only declined to from in  the approach for generating interest income focused on a decrease in cost of funds 
interest income declined million  or  in to million  while interest expense declined million  or  to million 
interest income and interest expense for the year ended december  were million and million  respectively  netting million in net interest income 
interest income and interest expense for the year ended december  were million and million  respectively  netting million in net interest income 
the decline in interest income during was driven by the million decrease in interest income from loans as a result of a decline in the average balance coupled with a decline in loan yield from the prior year by basis points 
investment yield also experienced a decline in yield of basis points in taxable securities and basis points in nontaxable securities from to this decline in investment yield was primarily offset by an increase in average long term investments of million 
offsetting the decreases to interest income were decreases in interest expenses of million in interest paid on deposits and  in interest paid on trust preferred securities 
the decrease in interest paid on deposits not only decreased due to the decrease in rates  but also due to the reallocation of the deposit portfolio to lower cost accounts  such noninterest and interest bearing checking accounts  from higher cost time deposits  such as certificates of deposit 
this was reflected by increases in average noninterest bearing checking accounts and interest bearing checking accounts of million and million  respectively  offset by a decrease in average in market and brokered certificates of deposit of million from to aside from the transfer of approximately million in money market account balances to the new interest bearing checking account described earlier  hsa were the primary reason for the increase in interest bearing checking accounts as they increased by million from december  to december  these hsa had an average rate of and have been one of our driving forces in reducing our cost of funds in   and also contributing to the decrease in interest expense was the decrease in our trust preferred debt securities interest rate in the first quarter of  as the remaining million of the million is now on a floating rate based on three month libor 
the weighted average rate decreased from in to in the increase of  in net interest income in from was due to an increase in net interest margin  which was offset by a purposeful decrease in total loans 
the net interest margin  or net yield on average earning assets  increased to in from in the increase in net interest margin in and was similar to in that we aggressively reduced deposit rates  while keeping them consistent with local market rates  and restructured our deposit mix by reducing our higher cost in market certificate of deposits 
offsetting the increase in net interest margin was a decrease of million in average earning assets from to these actions in   and were a continued response to the low interest rate environment which has existed since december when the federal reserve lowered the federal funds rates to 
the level of net interest income is primarily a function of asset size  as the weighted average interest rate received on earning assets is greater than the weighted average interest cost of funding sources  however  factors such as types of assets and liabilities  interest rate risk  liquidity  asset quality  and customer behavior also impact net interest income as well as the net yield

during  the loan portfolio had an average yield of  and earned million  or of total interest income  a decrease of million from this decrease in loans was offset by increases in long term investments 
the decrease of  in net interest income in from was the result of a reduction in average earning assets in the amount of million and the net result of a reduction in interest income outpacing the reduction in interest expense

savings deposits and interest bearing checking accounts totaled of average interest bearing liabilities during with an average rate of 
the company paid million of interest expense on borrowings  or of total interest expense  during in december  million of our trust preferred debt securities went to a floating rate of three month libor plus 
this reduced the average rate on this funding from for the year ending december  to for the year ending december  in march  the remaining million of our trust preferred debt securities went to a floating rate of three month libor plus  which lowered our costs from that funding type by  or  from to this reduced the average rate on this funding from for the year ending december  to for the year ending december  provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses was million for  million for  and million for in  our focus was on reducing watch list loans  specifically nonperforming and classified assets 
this was accomplished through charging down loans  selling loans  and working with our customers to move these loans to other financial institutions 
this strategy resulted in net charge offs of million 
of the million in charge offs  we previously had million reserved on those relationships as of december  we also received  in recoveries that offset the charge offs taken in and assisted in replenishing our allowance 
there were two commercial real estate relationships totaling  and four commercial relationships totaling million that were moved to nonaccrual status in requiring additional reserves totaling million 
in  our focus was on reducing nonperforming and classified assets through various methods  including charging down loans  selling loans  and working with our customers to move these loans to other financial institutions 
this strategy resulted in net charge offs of million 
while a portion of the expense was recorded to replenish the reserve after the million in charge offs  we previously had million reserved on those relationships as of december  we also received  in recoveries that offset the charge offs taken in and assisted in replenishing our allowance 
there were three commercial real estate relationships  two commercial relationships  and one residential real estate relationship that were downgraded to an impairment status in requiring additional reserves totaling million 
for  a portion of provision expense was recorded to replenish the reserve as it is used to charge off or charge down loans 
another portion of the expense was used to increase reserves on three commercial real estate relationships and one commercial relationship that were deemed impaired in or and required additional reserves of approximately million in due to a decrease in collateral values 
the provision expense recorded in reflected a million decrease from we maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level management feels is adequate to absorb probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio 
the evaluation is based upon our historical loan loss experience  along with the banking industry s historical loan loss experience  as well as known and inherent risks contained in the loan portfolio  composition and growth of the loan portfolio  current and projected economic conditions and other factors 
we had million of nonperforming loans at december   an increase of million from million in nonperforming loans at december  the increase in nonperforming loans is primarily the result of the downward migration of loans previously identified as either special mention  substandard  or impaired at december  homogenous loans  such as home equity and traditional residential real estate  are not risk rated per asc and become categorized as nonperforming when they become or more days past due 
over the past few years  we have been able to reduce the loans categorized as special mention  substandard  or doubtful 
for further detail regarding this reduction  see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition 
we reported million of net charge offs  or of average loans  during compared to million in net charge offs  or of average loans  during and million  or of average loans  in net charge offs during we had million  million  and million of nonperforming loans at december    and  respectively 
noninterest income total noninterest income was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in from of  was the result of an increase in trust and brokerage income of  an increase in mortgage banking income of  and a decrease in impairment on available for sale securities of  the increase in trust and brokerage income was a direct result of the increase in trust assets under management of million 
brokerage assets under management also grew during bringing our total asset under management to approximately million 
mortgage banking income increased  from to as a result of an increase in mortgage originations sold 
our mortgage department set a company record for the highest origination volume in one year  which was just over million 
of those originations  we only retained million in house and sold the remaining million in the secondary market at an average service release premium of approximately 
the decrease on the impairment on available for sale securities was the result of an improvement in the fair value of the two securities rated below investment grade with previous impairment charges 
during the fourth quarter of  we sold these two securities  and no other securities have been deemed impaired as of december  offsetting the increases to income was a decrease in the gains on available for sale securities of  the purpose for long term investments is to produce interest income and to manage liquidity 
in the event an opportunity arises to recognize a gain without limiting the long term potential of the portfolio  we may sell the investment 
at some point when interest rates begin to increase  we might need to recognize losses in our portfolio to better position ourselves for long term interest gains 
in  we did not believe that the short term gain from security sales outweighed the long term gain from collecting interest income based on the current portfolio  therefore  the gains on sale of available for sale securities decreased by  from we also experienced an increase of  in our net debit card interchange income in compared to as a result of the increase in the number of debit cards outstanding  specifically from increases in our hsa product 
noninterest expense noninterest expense totaled million in  which was a  or  decrease from the decrease was the result of decreases of  and  in fdic insurance premiums and oreo expenses  respectively  offset by increases in salary and benefits of  data processing of  and occupancy and equipment of  noninterest expense totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in of  in expenses was attributable to an increase of million in salaries and benefits and an increase of  in data processing costs 
these increases were offset by decreases of  and  in fdic premiums and oreo expenses  respectively  in during  fdic insurance premiums decreased as a direct result of the termination of our written agreement with the federal reserve  which was effective july  oreo expenses decreased as a result of fewer write downs to fair value by  in compared to the decrease in oreo balances through sales of  in caused the decrease in legal and maintenance expenses recorded in the oreo expense category associated with these properties 
salaries and benefits expense was million in and was of total noninterest expenses 
salaries and benefits expense increased primarily due to an increase of  in commissions paid to individuals in the mortgage department for an increase in mortgage originations to million in from million in additionally  the profit sharing expense increased by  from to as a result of an increase in our income before taxes 
in  we had two rewarding incentive programs that were specific to for asset quality improvement and reaching specific earnings milestones 
these two programs made up the majority of the incentive bonus expense in  which resulted in a decrease of  from to data processing expense increased by  as a result of the addition of non recurring projects related to our core system that will create efficiency and enhance revenue  an increase in the number of accounts outstanding  and a reallocation of expenses from other expense related to processing of debit cards 
during  in our hsa product we increased the number of accounts by  which directly impacts our processing expense as we are charged based on the number of accounts outstanding 
occupancy and equipment was million in compared to million in the increase of  was primarily due to the increase in real estate tax of  the increase was due to receiving new assessed values on all of our branch locations in allen county 
we also experienced an increase in repairs and maintenance of  due to freshening up the first floor of our headquarters location by replacing carpet and repainting the walls 
occupancy and equipment was the second largest expense and was of total noninterest expenses 
loan and professional expense decreased  from and was of total noninterest expenses 
the decrease in this category from was the result of decreases in our legal and investor relations fees of  accounting fees of  and our collection expenses of  accounting fees decreased primarily due to the liquidation of the reit and the investment subsidiary in  which resulted in two fewer entities to audit and prepare tax returns 
collection fees have decreased as a result of a decrease in the loans on the watch list 
we expect collection fees to continue decreasing as asset quality issues decrease 
during  salaries and benefits increased by million compared to there were a few reasons for the increase  including an increase in the average number of full time employees employed during the year  an increase in incentive program expenses from an improvement in earnings and improvements in asset quality  and an increase in k employer matching contributions 
data processing costs increased by  in primarily due to an increase in the number of deposit accounts and the purchase of additional services and or products from our core processing vendor 
offsetting the increase in noninterest expenses during were decreases in fdic premiums and oreo expenses of  and  respectively 
due to industry wide decreases in fdic assessment rates for determining insurance premiums in the first quarter of coupled with the additional decrease in our fdic assessment rates during the second quarter of  we experienced a decrease in our fdic premiums during compared the reduction in oreo expense was two fold 
first  there was a reduction in the additions to oreo  which was million of additions in compared to million of additions in second  the values of the properties did not decrease as much as in prior years  which would trigger a write down of the property to fair value 
during  our two largest expenses were salaries and benefits expense and occupancy and equipment expense  which made up and  respectively  of noninterest expenses 
salary and benefit costs were million in and were of total noninterest expenses 
occupancy and equipment expenses are the second largest expense at million and were of total noninterest expense in loan and professional costs were reported in the amount of million  which consisted of legal expenses associated with elevated levels of nonperforming assets and items pertaining to the written agreement 
premiums for deposit insurance from the fdic were million  or  of total noninterest expense 
real estate market values continued to decline in causing write downs and professional expenses of million on properties that have moved to other real estate owned 
monitoring and controlling overhead expenses while providing high quality service to customers is of the utmost importance to us 
the efficiency ratio  computed by dividing noninterest expense by net interest income plus noninterest income  was in compared to in and in from to  we made significant strides in improving our net interest margin  which translated into improved net interest income  through disciplined actions required to decrease nonperforming assets and an aggressive approach for pricing deposits 
income taxes expense in  tax expense was million compared to a tax benefit of million in and tax expense of  in the effective tax rate in was  which is very comparable to our effective tax rate in of 
the difference from these two years and the tax benefit recorded in was the reversal of the valuation allowance previously set up on the state deferred tax asset created by our book to tax timing differences at the state level and our state net operating losses created by our reit 
releasing the valuation allowance on the state deferred tax assets in was triggered by two events during the year that made it more likely than not that we will realize the state deferred tax asset within the next few years 
first  we had a net taxable income position over the past three years for federal purposes and we didn t expect that to change in the foreseeable future 
second  we liquidated our reit at the end of the third quarter of  which will create state taxable income going forward  if we continue to produce a profit as expected 
the effective tax rate for was 
aside from the reversal of the valuation allowance  we are able to maintain a fairly low effective tax rate due to elevated levels of tax exempt investment income derived from investing in municipal bonds and bank owned life insurance 
capital sources stockholders equity is a noninterest bearing source of funds  which provides support for asset growth 
stockholders equity was million and million at december  and  respectively 
affecting the increase in stockholders equity during was million in net income and an increase of  in unrealized gains  net of tax  on available for sale securities 
additionally  we recorded  of stock compensation expense 
offsetting these increases were the repurchase of  shares of the company s common stock of million and dividends paid to stockholders in the amount of million 
the company and the bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
failure to meet the various capital requirements can initiate regulatory action that could have a direct material effect on the financial statements 
currently  both the company and the bank have been categorized as well capitalized  the highest classification contained within the banking regulations 
the capital ratios of the company and the bank as of december  and are disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
each year  we refine our capital contingency plan and establish or reconfirm internal minimum capital levels that are in excess of those required by the regulators to remain well capitalized 
the plan provides that our total risk based capital ratio should be equal to or greater than and and our leverage ratio should be equal to or greater than and for the bank and the company  respectively 
our ability to pay cash and stock dividends is subject to limitations under various laws and regulations and to prudent and sound banking practices 
prior to no cash or stock dividends were paid 
in december  our board of directors formally approved the payment of dividends commencing in calendar this was based on an analysis of our liquidity needs  regulatory and capital requirements  and results of operations 
during  we paid dividends at annual rate of per share payable in four quarterly installments 
this was increased in by  which resulted in dividends paid totaling per share 
in january  our board of directors voted to pay a dividend of per share for the first quarter dividend payment 
in the second quarter of  however  we elected to forego the declaration of dividends on our common stock indefinitely 
the decision was based on the desire to retain capital and hedge against challenging economic and banking industry conditions as well as to maintain tower bank s current well capitalized status within the federal reserve system 
from april  until its termination on july   we were under a written agreement with the federal reserve and the idfi 
one of the requirements in the written agreement was that we not pay dividends on or redeem any of our common or preferred stock or other capital stock  or make any payments of interest on its trust preferred debt  without written approval from the federal reserve 
because of these restrictions  no preferred stock dividends  common stock dividends or trust preferred debt interest payments were made in or in june of  the company paid all of the deferred interest payments on its outstanding trust preferred subordinated securities in the amount of million 
the company received permission on may  from the federal reserve bank of chicago to make both of these payments on their respective due dates effective july   the federal reserve lifted and  therefore  terminated the written agreement between itself and the company  as well as its wholly owned subsidiaries 
as a result of this event  the bank was able to pay million in dividends to the holding company to fund the purchase of a million par value equity security in the amount of  to fund two quarterly dividends and one special dividend to stockholders totaling million  and to fund the repurchase of  shares of the company s common stock 
prior to the third quarter of  no dividend payments had been made since the first quarter of liquidity and capital ratios december  loan to deposit ratio loan to funding ratio total risk based capital tier risk based capital tier leverage capital liquidity liquidity is measured by our ability to raise funds through deposits  borrowed funds  capital or cash flow from the repayment of loans and investment securities 
these funds are used to meet depositor withdrawals  maintain reserve requirements  to fund loans and to fund operational expenses 
liquidity is primarily achieved through the growth of deposits and liquid assets such as securities available for sale  cash flow from securities  matured securities  and federal funds sold 
asset and liability management is the process of managing the balance sheet to achieve a mix of earning assets and liabilities that maximize profitability while providing adequate liquidity 
our liquidity strategy is to fund growth with deposits from both in market and out of market sources  federal home loan bank borrowings and to maintain an adequate level of short term and medium term investments to meet typical daily loan and deposit activity needs 
while deposits decreased million in from december   we can attribute approximately million to two customers deposits that were placed into noninterest bearing checking accounts at the bank for short term purposes in december of these two deposits were withdrawn from the bank during the first quarter of when a more suitable  permanent option was determined 
excluding these short term deposits  our deposit portfolio increased by approximately million during outside of these uncommon deposit portfolio changes  health savings accounts continue to be a primary leader in core deposit growth in these deposits showed an increase of million to a balance of million and approximately  accounts at december  compared to a balance of million and  accounts at december  while we mainly generate deposits from in market sources  we also generate certificates of deposit through national  so called out of market sources 
these deposits include brokered deposits  which we began accepting during the use of brokered deposits offers us the flexibility to structure the duration and volume of funding that in market deposits cannot provide 
as a result  we have chosen this type of funding vehicle over the past several years to increase profitability by matching the duration of our assets with that of our funding 
an example of this funding strategy occurred in when we started to implement a municipal bond leverage strategy that match funds million in investments with million of brokered deposits 
at december   the million of investments was complete and was funded with new brokered deposits of approximately million 
the remaining funding for the investment purchases will be completed in early terms for our new brokered deposit purchases in and ranged from one to ten years  with an average life between four and five years 
during  approximately million of brokered certificates of deposit matured  of which only million was replaced excluding the million in additions for the municipal bond leverage strategy 
at december   approximately of our deposits were generated in market  while were out of market deposits  compared to of in market deposits in and out of market 
in addition to our in market and out of market deposits  we also include borrowings from the fhlb and trust preferred securities in our funding base 
fhlb borrowings increased by million from million at december  to million at december  we expect limited growth in the loan portfolio through funding for the loan portfolio will continue to come from in market sources through the marketing of products and the development of branch locations 
we will also continue to develop wholesale and out of market deposits and borrowing capacities and use them to augment interest rate sensitivity strategies and liquidity capabilities and to diversify the funding base of the bank 
we have the ability to borrow money on a daily basis through correspondent banks federal funds purchased along with borrowings from the federal reserve discount window  but had no borrowings of these types at december  and additional capacity to borrow overnight in the form of unused secured lines of commitment from correspondent banks totaled million at december  and million at december  we also had additional capacity to borrow overnight in the form of unsecured lines of commitment from correspondent banks of million from correspondent banks at december  the unused line at the discount window totaled million at december  and december  we view this type of funding as a secondary and temporary source of funds 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet risk in addition to normal loan funding and deposit flow  we also need to maintain liquidity to meet the demands of certain unfunded loan commitments and standby and commercial letters of credit 
the bank maintains off balance sheet financial instruments in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
loan commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer at any time  as the customer s needs vary  as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we monitor fluctuations in loan balances and commitment levels and include such data in our overall liquidity management 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized  if any  in the balance sheet 
the bank s maximum exposure to loan loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the face amount of these instruments 
commitments to extend credit are recorded when they are funded and standby letters of credit are recorded at fair value 
the bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
collateral  such as accounts receivable  securities  inventory  property and equipment  is generally required based on management s credit assessment of the borrower

related persons transactions are subject to our statement of policy for the review  approval or ratification of transactions with related persons 
a copy of this policy is available on our website at www 
towerbank 
net 
the policy applies to any transaction with a related person 
under our policy  a related person is a person who is  or at any time since the beginning of our last fiscal year was a director or executive officer  a nominee to become a director  a stockholder who beneficially owns or more of our common stock  an immediate family member that is  a spouse  child  parent  sibling  or an in law of any of the foregoing persons  as well as any entity which is owned or controlled by any of such persons or of which such person is a general partner or a or greater beneficial owner or any other person identified by our audit committee or our board of directors as a related person for purposes of this policy 
once a person has been identified as related person and if tower financial corporation or any subsidiary is a participant  then if the aggregate amount involved in the transaction exceeds  and the related person has a direct or indirect interest other than simply as a result of being a director or less than a beneficial owner of the entity involved the transaction must be considered  approved or ratified by the audit committee 
we have established the threshold transactional amount at  which triggers the review  even though applicable sec regulations set the threshold at  we have done this so that even smaller transactions with related persons will be reviewed for fairness and appropriateness 
employment of a related person in the ordinary course of business consistent with our policies and practices with respect to the employment of non related persons in similar positions so long as the related person is not an executive officer required to be reported in our annual proxy statement is not subject to the policy 
transactions involving competitive bids or transactions involving services as a bank depository  transfer agent  registrar  or trustee are considered pre approved for purposes of our policy 
all other transactions subject to our policy must be approved in advance by the audit committee  unless our chief executive officer or chief financial officer determines that it is impractical to wait until an audit committee meeting 
in such event  the chair of the audit committee may review and approve the proposed related person transaction but shall then promptly report any such approval to the full audit committee 
all material facts respecting the related person transaction must be disclosed to the audit committee 
in the event that we become aware of a related person transaction that has not been approved prior to its consummation  the matter must then still be reviewed by the audit committee  which will then review all relevant facts and circumstances  shall evaluate all available options including ratification  revision or termination of the transaction  and shall take such course of action as it deems appropriate 
in reviewing any related person transaction  the audit committee must consider the proposed benefits to the company  the availability of other sources of comparable products or services  an assessment of whether the proposed transaction is at least on terms comparable to the terms available to an unrelated third party or to employees generally  and must then determine that the transaction is fair and reasonable to the company 
financial condition in  we reported million in net income compared to million in while net income decreased  the decrease resulted from a million decrease in income taxes 
the difference in income taxes from to was the result of reversing the state valuation allowance in on a pre tax basis  the company s income improved by million  which was the result of a decrease in provision expense  a decrease in noninterest expense  and an increase in noninterest income 
during and  we continued to focus on improving profitability  both short term and long term  by improving asset quality  restructuring the balance sheet  maintaining the net interest margin  and controlling expenses 
nonperforming asset levels continue to be higher than we would prefer  but we are seeing improvement in several lending relationships  where they have been rehabilitated and could move to a performing status sometime in the near future 
to be able to move to performing status once a loan is considered nonperforming  certain performance levels are expected and must be sustained for a period of time 
the decrease in nonperforming assets was through improvements  charge downs or fair value adjustments  and refinancing through another institution 
total loans decreased by million and were offset by an increase in long term investments by million 
cash and cash equivalents decreased by million primarily due to extremely short term deposits of approximately million being placed in the bank in december these deposits were held in cash and cash equivalents due to the short duration established for these deposits  which were withdrawn in the first quarter of  as expected 
without these extremely short term deposits  our total deposits would have increased by approximately million 
while interest rates are expected to remain low  management anticipates that assets will begin to level out or slightly grow in the near future as we look to increase our earning assets  through the origination and purchasing of quality loans and investments 
earning assets the bank s total loans declined million  or  during total loans were million at december  compared to million at december  the loan portfolio  which equaled and of earning assets at december  and  respectively  was primarily comprised of commercial and commercial real estate loans at both dates and were made to business interests generally located within the bank s market area 
approximately of the loan portfolio at december  consisted of general commercial and industrial loans primarily secured by inventory  receivables  and equipment  while of the loan portfolio consisted of commercial loans primarily secured by real estate 
the largest concentrations of credit within the commercial and commercial real estate categories are represented by owner occupied and investment real estate at million  or of total loans  and commercial not associated with real estate at million  or of total loans 
while the general portfolio mix has remained about the same  the main direction the bank has taken was to put more resources into the commercial versus the commercial real estate product 
the concentration and growth in commercial credits is in keeping with the bank s strategy of focusing a substantial amount of efforts on commercial banking

these guidelines include procedures for loan review and to elicit the identification of problem loans as early as practical in order to provide effective loan portfolio administration 
we strive  through application of our credit policies and procedures  to minimize the risks and uncertainties inherent in lending 
in following these policies and procedures  we must rely on estimates  appraisals and evaluation of loans and the possibility that changes could occur because of changing general economic conditions and changes in consumer preferences  government monetary policies  changes in a borrower s financial condition  and other factors that can affect a loan s collectability 
identified problem loans  which exhibit characteristics financial or otherwise that could cause the loans to become nonperforming or require restructuring in the future  are included on an internal watch list 
senior management reviews this list regularly and adjusts for changing conditions 
over the past few years  we have been prudent in recognizing and reporting loans in trouble and helping them return to a performing status 
as a result of these efforts  we have been able to reduce the loans categorized as special mention  substandard  or doubtful 
the following table illustrates the recorded investment of loans by risk category for the years ending december    and december  in thousands special mention substandard doubtful total of total loans the recorded investment in loans includes accrued interest and deferred fees  less nonaccrual interest paid  and deferred costs 
nonperforming loans at december  were million  of which million were loans placed on nonaccrual status   of loans still accruing at days or more past due  and million of troubled debt restructured loans 
the primary reason for the increase in nonperforming loans was the addition of four commercial loan relationships in the amount of million  of which all four were previously on the company s watch list at december  while nonperforming loans increased in  the increase was the result of loans previously on the watch list migrating downward to nonperforming status 
the watch list decreased in as a result of the management s focus on improving asset quality and profitability 
the reduction in the watch list was the result of loan sales  charge offs  upgrades in rating  and refinancing through another institution 
total impaired loans were million  which included most of the nonperforming loans plus loans deemed impaired and still accruing of million 
in the nonaccrual category  the increase of million was the result of the addition of two commercial real estate relationships million  two commercial loan relationships million  and one residential real estate relationship million 
the two commercial real estate relationships added to nonaccrual were previously reported as accruing nonperforming troubled debt restructures have recognized million of charge offs  causing a decrease in their carrying value to a total of  at december  the one residential real estate loan relationship was previously reported in the days past due and accruing category in the amount of million at december  and has recognized a charge off of  in additionally  the two commercial loan relationships added to nonaccrual were reported in the special mention category of our watch list at december  the loans past days and still accruing category has been reduced by million from as a result of the one residential real estate loan mentioned above in the amount of million moving to nonaccrual and two commercial real estate loan relationships totaling  moving to nonaccrual 
the nonperforming troubled debt restructured loan category decreased by  as a result of the two commercial real estate loan relationships mentioned above that comprised the category at december  totaling million moved to nonaccrual in once these loans move to nonaccrual  they are reported as such  even though they are still considered nonperforming troubled debt restructured loans 
offsetting the decrease was the addition of two commercial loan relationships totaling million  which were previously reported in the substandard category of our watch list at december  nonperforming loans at december  were million  of which million were loans placed on nonaccrual status  million of loans still accruing at days or more past due  and million of troubled debt restructured loans 
total impaired loans were million  which included most of the nonperforming loans plus loans deemed impaired and still accruing of million 
nonperforming loans at december  were million  of which million were loans placed on nonaccrual status  million of loans still accruing at days or more past due  and million of troubled debt restructured loans

impaired loans  with specific loss allocations  which are measured for impairment using the fair value of the collateral for collateral dependent loans  had a carrying value of million  with a valuation allowance of million  resulting in an additional provision for loan losses of million for the period ending december  this compares to a carrying value of million and a valuation allowance of million  resulting in an additional provision for loan losses of million for the period ending december  the decrease in the valuation allowance from to was primarily due to charging down two impaired commercial real estate relationships  one impaired jumbo residential and home equity relationship  and one commercial relationship with a carrying value of million and a valuation allowance of million  or of the total valuation allowance on all impaired loans at december  impaired loans with a carrying amount totaling million  with valuation allowance of  at december  were excluded from the chart above as these were measured using the present value of expected future cash flows  which is not considered fair value and resulted in additional provision expense of  adjustments to certain commercial and residential real estate properties classified as other real estate owned oreo are measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value  less costs to sell 
fair values are generally based on third party appraisals of the property that include certain assumptions and unobservable inputs used many times by appraisers  resulting in a level classification 
in cases where the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  less costs to sell  an impairment loss is recognized 
whenever a new fair value is determined  which is typically done on an annual basis in the other real estate owned category  we report the property at that new value 
at december  the carrying value was million  with no valuation allowance  resulting in additional oreo expense of  in this compares to a carrying value of million  with no valuation allowance  at december   resulting in expense of  for the remaining properties in the other real estate owned have either been recently added  at fair value  to the category or were valued more than months ago 
during  the bank recorded million in net charged off loans compared to million in and million in the net charge offs to total average loans was   and in   and  respectively 
in  three commercial relationships  three commercial real estate relationships  and one residential real estate relationship made up of total charge offs 
specific reserves on these relationships at december  totaled million 
of the charge offs recorded in  five commercial real estate loans made up million  or  of total charge offs and five commercial loans made up million  or  of total charge offs 
offsetting the charge offs was a recovery on a commercial unsecured loan in the amount of  in the remaining net charge offs were less than  each 
of the loans charged off in  million came from commercial loans and one commercial real estate loan that had been either partially or fully reserved previously 
there was one residential real estate loan from a pool of loans purchased in from countrywide  now serviced by bank of america  that had a  charge off  but only had a small reserve based on asc guidelines 
the remaining net charge offs were less than  each 
offsetting the charge offs were  of recoveries  which included a recovery of  on one commercial loan relationship that was charged off earlier in the year

we allocate specific portions of the allowance for loan losses to specifically identified problem loans 
our evaluation of the allowance is further based on consideration of actual loss experience  the present and prospective financial condition of borrowers  industry concentrations within the portfolio and general economic conditions 
we believe that the present allowance is adequate  based on the foregoing broad range of considerations 
the following table illustrates the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan type

additionally  banking regulators can require an increase to the allowance for loan losses if they deem necessary to satisfy regulatory safety and soundness concerns

the portfolio will continue to include some short term liquid holdings from time to time based on liquidity needs 
during the fourth quarter of  we implemented a municipal bond leverage strategy that match funds million in investments with million of brokered deposits 
at december   the million of investments was complete and was funded with new brokered deposits of approximately million 
the remaining funding for the investment purchases will be completed in early since the inception of the company  all securities have been designated as available for sale and held to maturity as defined by accounting standards 
securities designated as available for sale are stated at fair value  with the unrealized gains and losses  net of income tax  reported as a separate component of stockholders equity

together  these short term assets  which recorded a decrease of million during  were million and million at december  and  respectively 
at december  and  these short term assets were approximately and of earning assets 
source of funds our major source of funds is from core deposits of local businesses  governmental and municipal public fund entities  and consumers within our market area 
we also generate certificates of deposit through national out of market sources outside allen and surrounding counties 
we generate these out of market deposits through negotiated transactions with brokers 
total deposits were million at december  and million at december   a decrease of million  or 
at december  total deposits were million 
noninterest bearing deposits totaled million at december   a million  or  decrease from million at december  at december   noninterest bearing deposits were approximately of total deposits  a decrease from the level of 
of the million decrease  we can attribute approximately million to two customers deposits that were placed into noninterest bearing checking accounts at the bank for short term purposes in december of these two deposits were withdrawn from the bank during the first quarter of when a more suitable  permanent option was determined 
additionally  approximately million was transferred to a new interest bearing checking account for commercial customers during the first quarter of noninterest bearing deposits at december  were comprised of million in business checking accounts   in public funds  and million in consumer accounts 
interest bearing deposits increased by million  or  during and ended at million compared to million at december  as mentioned above  approximately million of the increase in this category was due to the transfer of funds to a new interest bearing checking product from noninterest bearing checking accounts 
interest bearing deposits at december  were comprised of approximately in money market accounts  in interest bearing checking and savings accounts  and in certificates of deposit 
the december  percentages reflect a modest change in the deposit mix from  when the percentages were   and  respectively 
interest bearing checking accounts reported a million increase from primarily due to the increase in health savings accounts and the transfer of funds from noninterest bearing to a new interest bearing checking account for commercial customers 
health savings accounts continue to be a high growth  low cost product for us which is reflected by increases in balances of million from to and million from to in  we increased the number of active health savings accounts from just over  at december  to slightly over  at december  additionally  we expect to receive another large deposit of approximately million in january into these accounts when our customers typically make their employer contributions  as we have witnessed over the last several years 
other categories reporting declines in balances during the year include in market cd s of million and money market accounts of million 
throughout and  we decreased our interest rates on several products to reduce our cost of funds  encourage the retention of true customers  and shift our mix from certificates of deposit to lower cost products 
this increase in low cost funding allowed us to reduce the amount of brokered deposits outstanding from million at december  to million 
of the million decrease in brokered deposits  million were called prior to maturity with a weighted average rate of 
while we accelerated the amortization of the brokered deposit fees causing net additional interest expense of approximately  in march of  we have saved and will continue to save approximately  per month in interest expense going forward until this funding would need to be replaced 
during the fourth quarter of  we implemented a municipal bond leverage strategy that match funds million in investments with million of brokered deposits 
at december   the million of investments was complete and was funded with new brokered deposits of approximately million 
the remaining funding for the investment purchases will be completed in early the company had borrowings of million at december  compared to million at december  the increase was due to increasing our fhlb advances by million and utilizing our line of credit at the fhlb in that amount of million at december  to take advantage of the lower interest rates available in that funding market 
we also utilized this short term borrowing approach to fund investment purchases  outside of the municipal bond leverage strategy  in anticipation of the annual employer and employee hsa deposit funding in january of the current weighted average rate on the fhlb advances is with a weighted average remaining maturity of years 
the interest rate on the line of credit at december  was 
we had million of aggregate principal amount in junior subordinated debenture outstanding at december  and we currently have two statutory trust subsidiaries 
tct effected a private placement of million in trust preferred securities on december  tct effected a private placement of million on december  the proceeds were loaned to us in exchange for junior subordinated debentures with similar terms to the trust preferred securities 
these securities are considered tier i capital with certain limitations applicable under current regulatory guidelines 
the junior subordinated debentures are subject to mandatory redemption  in whole or in part  upon repayment of the trust preferred securities at maturity or their earlier redemption at the par amount 
the maturity date of the trust preferred securities issued by tct is december  subject to our having received prior approval of the federal reserve bank  if then required  the trust preferred securities became redeemable prior to the maturity date as of december  and each year thereafter at our option 
at december   the interest rate on tct moved to a floating rate of three month libor plus basis points  or as of december   as we chose not redeem it at that point

per the debenture agreements  we have the ability to defer payment of the interest for twenty consecutive quarters 
during  we sent the written notice each quarter beginning with the first quarter of to the trustees of the trust preferred securities stating that we elected to defer payment of the interest 
while no payments of interest were made in or  we continued to accrue the payments for each quarter 
in june of  the company paid all of the deferred interest payments on its outstanding trust preferred subordinated securities in the amount of million 
the company received permission on may  from the federal reserve bank of chicago to make both of these payments on their respective due dates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk analysis our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk and  to a lesser extent  liquidity risk 
all of the company s transactions are denominated in us dollars with no specific foreign exchange exposure 
the company has no agricultural related loan assets and therefore has no significant exposure to changes in commodity prices 
any impact that changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices would have on interest rates is assumed to be insignificant 
interest rate risk is the exposure of our financial condition to adverse movements in interest rates 
we derive our income primarily from the excess of interest collected on our interest earning assets over the interest paid on our interest bearing liabilities 
the rates of interest we earn on our assets and owe on our liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
since market interest rates change over time  we are exposed to lower profitability if we cannot adapt to interest rate changes 
accepting interest rate risk can be an important source of profitability and stockholder value  however  excessive levels of interest rate risk could pose a significant threat to our earnings and capital base 
accordingly  effective risk management that maintains interest rate risk at prudent levels is essential to our safety and soundness 
evaluating the exposure to changes in interest rates includes assessing both the adequacy of the process used to control interest rate risk and the quantitative level of exposure 
our interest rate risk management process seeks to ensure that appropriate policies  procedures  management information and internal controls are in place to maintain interest rate risk at prudent levels with consistency and continuity 
in evaluating the quantitative level of interest rate risk  we assess the existing and potential future effects of changes in interest rates on our financial condition  including capital adequacy  earnings  liquidity and overall asset quality 
there are two interest rate risk measurement techniques that we may use 
the first  which is commonly referred to as gap analysis  measures the difference between the dollar amount of interest sensitive assets and liabilities that will be refinanced or re priced during a given time period 
a significant re pricing gap could result in a negative impact to our net interest margin during periods of changing market interest rates 
the following table describes our position as of december  rate sensitivity analysis in thousands within three months three to twelve months one to five years after five years total assets federal funds sold  short term investments and interest earning deposits securities available for sale fhlbi and frb stock loans held for sale fixed rate loans variable rate loans allowance for loan losses other assets total assets liabilities interest bearing checking savings accounts money market accounts time deposits  time deposits  and over brokered deposit money market brokered deposit certificates of deposit short term borrowings fhlb advances junior subordinated debt noninterest bearing checking other liabilities total liabilities stockholders equity total sources of funds net asset liability gap cumulative gap percent of cumulative gap to total assets a second interest rate risk measurement used is commonly referred to as net interest income simulation analysis 
a simulation model assesses the direction and magnitude of variations in net interest income resulting from potential changes in market interest rates 
key assumptions in the model include prepayment speeds on various loan and investment assets  cash flows and maturities of interest sensitive assets and liabilities  and changes in market conditions impacting loan and deposit volume and pricing 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain  subject to fluctuation and revision in a dynamic environment  therefore  a model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or exactly predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and our strategies  among other factors 
as growth has dictated  we began utilizing simulation analysis as a tool for measuring the effects of interest rate risk on the income statement at the end of in addition to changes in interest rates  the level of future net interest income is also dependent on a number of other variables  including the growth  composition and absolute levels of loans  deposits  and other earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  economic and competitive conditions  potential changes in lending  investing  and deposit gathering strategies  client preferences  and other factors 
the following table provides information about our financial instruments used for purposes other than trading that are rate sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  it does not provide when these items may actually re price 
for loans receivable  securities  and liabilities with contractual maturities  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by contractual maturities as well as our historical experience of the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the prepayment of loans and mortgage backed securities 
for core deposits demand deposits  interest bearing checking  savings  and money market deposits that have no contractual maturity  the table presents principal cash flows and  as applicable related weighted average interest rates based upon our historical experience  and management s judgment as applicable  concerning their most likely withdrawal behaviors 
the current historical interest rates for core deposits have been assumed to apply for future periods in this table as the actual interest rates that will need to be paid to maintain these deposits are not currently known 
weighted average variable rates are based upon contractual rates existing at the report date
