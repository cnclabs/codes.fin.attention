risk factors 
in the accompanying analysis of financial information  we sometimes use information derived from consolidated financial information but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap 
some of this data is considered non gaap financial measures 
for such measures  we have provided supplemental explanations and reconciliations in item selected financial data under the heading non gaap financial measures 
overview the company operates in three reportable segments radiation measurement  medical physics and medical products 
the company s radiation measurement segment is a mature business and growth in numbers of customers is modest 
in recent years  the company s strategy has been to expand into new international markets  primarily by partnering with existing dosimetry service providers with a prominent local presence 
in addition  the company has been developing new platforms and formats for its osl technology  such as inlight  radwatch and radlight to gain access to markets where the company previously did not have a significant presence  such as smaller in house and commercial laboratories  nuclear power facilities  tactical military and first responder measurement and hospitals to support measurement of patient exposure to radiation 
revenue growth in recent years has occurred as a result of entry into new markets through joint ventures and acquisitions  modest unit growth  sale of inlight equipment and badges  radwatch radlight  and new ancillary opportunities to obtain regular price increases from its customers 
the continued economic downturn and uncertain impact of healthcare reform has resulted in increased pricing pressure with the company healthcare customer base  which is expected to continue into the future 
through its lmp operations  the company provides therapeutic and imaging physics services to the medical community 
lmp is the leading nationwide provider of medical physics services to hospitals  free standing imaging centers and radiation therapy centers 
medical physics services is a large fragmented market 
market growth is expected to be driven by the utilization of radiation in the provision of healthcare  trends towards outsourcing of services in healthcare settings  and a tightening domestic supply of qualified medical physicists 
the company reports these operating results in the medical physics reporting segment 
in november  the company completed the acquisition of izi and formed the medical products segment 
izi is a leading global provider of high quality medical consumable accessories used in radiology  radiation therapy  and image guided surgery procedures 
izi s customer base includes buyers at several stages along the supply chain including distributors  manufacturers of image guided navigation equipment  and product end users such as community hospitals  radiation oncology clinics  mammography clinics  and imaging centers 
izi s medical accessories range from consumables used with mri  ct  and mammography technologies to highly engineered passive reflective markers used during image guided surgery procedures 
in alignment with treatment trends which increasingly utilize radiation for the diagnosis and treatment of disease  as well as growing demand for minimally invasive procedures  izi products provide the ability to increase procedural accuracy while decreasing procedural time 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that management make assumptions and estimates that affect the results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements as well as related disclosures 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results  and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
below are the critical accounting policies which have been applied in the preparation of the company s financial statements and accompanying notes 
revenue recognition and deferred contract revenue the source of radiation measurement segment revenues for the company is radiation measuring and measurement services including other services incidental to measuring and monitoring 
the measuring and monitoring services provided by the company to its customers are of a subscription nature and are continuous 
the company views its business in the radiation measurement segment as services provided to customers over a period of time and the wear period is the period over which those services are provided 
badge production  wearing of badges  badge analysis  and report preparation are integral to the benefit that the company provides to its customers 
these services are provided to customers on an agreed upon recurring basis monthly  bi monthly  quarterly  semi annually or annually that the customer chooses for the wear period 
revenue is recognized on a straight line basis  adjusted for changes in pricing and volume  over the wear period as the service is continuous and no other discernible pattern of recognition is evident 
revenues are recognized over the periods in which the customers wear the badges irrespective of whether invoiced in advance or in arrears 
to a lesser degree the company does provide equipment and sells badges to smaller distributors and joint ventures 
these product sales are recognized at time of shipment 
the company  through its medical physics segment  offers full scope medical physics services to hospitals and radiation therapy centers 
services offered include  but are not limited to  clinical physics support in radiation oncology  commissioning services  special projects support and imaging physics services 
delivery of the medical physics services can be of a contracted  recurring nature or as a discrete project with a defined service outcome 
recurring services often are provided on the customer premises by a full time employee or fraction of a full time employee 
these services are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the life of the contract 
fee for service projects revenue is recognized when the service is delivered 
contracted services are billed on an agreed upon recurring basis  either in advance or arrears of the service being delivered 
customers may be billed monthly  quarterly  or at some other regular interval over the contracted period 
the amounts recorded as deferred revenue represent invoiced amounts in advance of delivery of the service 
management believes that the amount of deferred contract revenue fairly represents remaining business activity with customers invoiced in advance 
fee for service revenue is typically associated with much shorter contract periods  or with discrete individual projects 
invoicing is usually done after completion of the project and customer acceptance thereof 
the medical products segment offers a broad product portfolio ranging from consumables used with mri  ct  and mammography technologies to highly engineered consumable passive reflective markers used during image guided surgery procedures 
the company recognizes revenue upon product shipment  provided that a purchase order has been received or a contract has been executed  there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  the sales price is fixed and determinable and collection is deemed probable 
the amounts recorded as deferred contract revenue in the consolidated balance sheets represent invoiced amounts in advance of delivery of the service  and are net of services rendered through the respective consolidated balance sheet date 
such advance billings amounted to million and million  respectively  as of september  and property  plant equipment and other assets maintenance and repairs are charged to expense and renewals and betterments are capitalized 
plant and equipment and other assets  primarily dosimetry badges  are recorded at cost and are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives  which are primarily years for buildings  three to eight years for equipment  five to ten years for internal software and thirty months to eight years for other assets 
the company assesses the carrying value and the remaining useful lives of its property  plant  equipment  and other assets when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable or the estimated useful life may no longer be appropriate 
factors that could trigger this review include competitive conditions  government regulations and technological changes 
the company capitalizes costs of software which is acquired  internally developed  or modified solely to meet the company s internal needs 
in accordance with financial accounting standards boards fasb authoritative guidance  internal and external costs incurred to develop internal use computer software during the application development stage are capitalized 
costs incurred during the preliminary project stage as well as training costs and maintenance costs during the post implementation operation stage are expensed 
capitalized costs of software amounted to million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company s intangible assets include purchased customer lists  licenses  patents  trademarks  tradenames and goodwill 
purchased customer lists are recorded at cost and are amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives  which range from to years 
patents and licenses are also recorded at cost and are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives  which range from to years 
tradenames have both definite lives up to years and indefinite lives 
the company acquired goodwill primarily from its acquisitions of landauer europe  sapra landauer  lmp and izi as well as other smaller investments 
goodwill has an indefinite life 
fasb authoritative guidance requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets with indefinite lives be reviewed annually for impairment 
the company has three segments reporting units  radiation measurement  medical physics and medical products 
the company performs an impairment test for each of its segments with goodwill annually 
an impairment test is also performed for goodwill and other intangible assets that are not being amortized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
triggering events include  but are not limited to  a current period operating or cash flow loss  a product  technology  or service introduced by a competitor  or a loss of key personnel 
when such events or changes in circumstances occur  the company performs a financial analysis of future undiscounted cash flows projections by asset or asset group 
pursuant to our policy  the company performed the annual goodwill impairment test as of september  and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed as of that date 
during the third quarter of fiscal  it became apparent that recent changes implemented to the medical products segment had not yet achieved anticipated upward sales trends to the extent forecasted 
early budget reviews also indicated future sales growth may be less than expected 
the company updated the forecasted results of operations for the medical products operating segment based on the third quarter fiscal financial results and the best estimates of future operations 
the updated forecast reflected a slower growth in revenues for the medical products segment due to anticipated continued pricing pressures from certain competitors greater than the anticipated growth from existing and new product sales 
as a result  the company concluded a triggering event occurred  and in connection with the preparation of the financial statements for the quarter ended june   the company performed an impairment analysis with respect to the carrying value of goodwill in the medical products segment 
in accordance with fasb asc topic  the company aggregates their business components into segments and test for goodwill impairment 
goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a segment with its net book value or carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a segment exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the segment is considered not to be impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of the segment exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the segment s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the segment s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the segment is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the segment had been acquired in a business combination  and the fair value of the segment was the purchase price paid to acquire the segment 
based on the result of the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis  the company determined that the fair value of the medical products segment was less than its carrying value as of june  and  as such  the company applied the second step of the goodwill impairment test to this segment 
based on the result of this second step of the goodwill impairment analysis  the company recorded a million non cash pretax charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in the medical products segment 
as a result of the charge recognized during the third quarter of fiscal  the carrying amount of the goodwill in the medical products segment was reduced to million at june  determining the fair value of a segment requires the company s management to make significant judgments  estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
in estimating the fair value of the medical products segment  the company considered the income approach and the market approach 
the income approach recognizes that the value of an asset is premised upon the expected receipt of future economic benefits 
this approach involves projecting the cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
fair value indications are developed in the income approach by discounting expected future cash flows available to the investor at a rate which reflects the risk inherent in the investment 
the market approach is primarily comprised of comparable companies 
this approach compares the subject segment to selected reasonably similar companies whose securities are actively traded in the public markets 
comparing revenue growth and ebitda margins allows the company to project an indicated range of fair values 
in determining the fair value of the medical products segment  the company has relied on a combination of the income approach and the market approach 
for companies providing services similar to those provided by the company  the income and market approaches will generally provide the most reliable indications of value because the value of such companies is more dependent on their ability to generate earnings than on the value of the individual assets 
in the income approach  the company utilized a discounted cash flow analysis  which involved estimating the expected after tax cash flows that will be generated by the medical products segment and then discounting these cash flows to present value reflecting the relevant risks associated with the segment and the time value of money 
this approach requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including long term projections of future cash flows  market conditions  discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  revenue growth  perpetual growth rates and profitability  among others 
in estimating future cash flows for the medical products segment  the company relied on an internally generated year forecasts built around previous estimates and modified for recent weaknesses and business assumptions 
the company s forecast is based on the company s historical experience  current backlog  expected market demand  and other industry information 
the company s discounted cash flow analysis assumed an weighted average cost of capital discount rate considering the segment as an independent standalone entity not part of the company s enterprise 
in the market approach  we selected reasonably similar companies whose securities are actively traded in the public markets 
comparing revenue growth and ebitda margins allows the company to project an indicated range of fair values 
these multiples were then applied to the operating data for the medical products segment and adjusted for factors to arrive at an indication of value 
while the company believes that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable  different estimates and assumptions could result in different outcomes 
the table below presents the decrease in the fair value of the medical products segment from the fourth quarter fiscal model given a one percent increase in the discount rate or a one percent decrease in the long term assumed annual revenue growth rate 
dollars in thousands decrease in fair value of the medical products segment discount rate increase by long term growth rate decrease by as described above  a goodwill impairment analysis requires significant judgments  estimates and assumptions 
the results of this impairment analysis are as of a point in time 
there is no assurance that the actual future earnings or cash flows of the company s segments will not decline significantly from our projections 
any significant decline in our operations could result in additional goodwill impairment charges 
after taking into account the million impairment charge  the carrying values of goodwill for each of our segments as of september  are as follows dollars in thousands radiation measurement medical physics medical products total goodwill at september  effects of foreign currency accumulated goodwill impairment goodwill at september  intangible assets represent purchased assets that lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill 
the company s intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  totaled million at september  and consist of customer lists  trademarks and trade names  licenses and patents as well as other intangibles 
the company uses valuation techniques in estimating the initial fair value of acquired intangible assets 
these valuations are primarily based on the present value of the estimated net cash flows expected to be derived from the intangible assets  discounted for assumptions such as future customer attrition 
the company evaluates intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
therefore  changes such as higher or earlier than expected customer attrition or obsolescence of technology may result in higher future amortization charges or an impairment charge for intangible assets 
as part of the goodwill impairment analysis discussed above  the company also reviewed the medical products segment intangible assets and did not identify any impairment 
information regarding the value of goodwill and other intangible assets is presented under the footnote goodwill and other intangible assets in item of this annual report on form k 
income taxes the company estimates the income tax provision for income taxes that are currently payable  and records deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences in tax consequences between the financial statements and tax returns 
temporary differences result from  among other events  revenues  expenses  gains  or losses that are included in taxable income of an earlier or later year than the year in which they are recognized in financial income 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
to the extent that deferred tax assets will not likely be recovered from future taxable income  a valuation allowance is established against such deferred tax assets 
the company maintains cash indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions 
management exercises significant judgment in the valuation of its current and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the company recognizes the financial statement effects of its tax positions in its current and deferred tax assets and liabilities when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority 
management considers  among other factors  the company s current and past performance  the market environment in which the company operates  and tax planning strategies 
further  the company provides for income tax issues not yet resolved with federal  state  local  and foreign tax authorities 
the company assesses and updates its tax positions when significant changes in circumstances occur  which may cause a change in judgment about the likelihood of realizing the deferred items 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
any change to the company s policy on cash indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions would not likely result in any significant incremental us federal and state income tax liability 
further information regarding the company s income taxes is contained under the footnote income taxes in item of this annual report on form k 
defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans the pension expenses and benefit obligations recorded for the company s defined benefit plans are dependent on actuarial assumptions 
the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans were frozen as of march these assumptions include discount rates  expected return on plan assets  interest costs  expected compensation increases  benefits earned  mortality rates  and other factors 
management reviews the plan assumptions on an annual basis to ensure that the most current  relevant information is considered 
if actual results vary considerably from those that are expected or if future changes are made to these assumptions  the amounts recognized for these plans could change significantly 
the weighted average assumed discount rates used to determine plan expenses were for both pension and other benefits in fiscal and for both pension and other benefits in fiscal for fiscal expense  the long term rate of return of plan assets was  unchanged from fiscal in establishing the rate  management considered the historical rates of return and the current and planned asset classes of the plan investment portfolio 
the weighted average discount rate used to determine benefit obligations at september  was compared to the september  rate of  adjusted to reflect the single rate that  when applied to the projected benefit disbursements from the plan  would result in the same discounted value as the array of rates that make up the citigroup pension discount curve as of september the company recognizes on its balance sheet the amount by which the projected benefit obligations of its defined benefit plans exceed the fair value of plan assets 
subsequent changes in the funded status of the plans as a result of future transactions and events  amortization of previously unrecognized costs  and changes to actuarial assumptions are recognized as an asset or a liability and amortized as components of net periodic pension cost or accumulated other comprehensive income 
an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside of management s control could have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
information regarding these plans is contained under the footnote employee benefit plans in item of this annual report on form k 
stock based compensation the company measures and recognizes compensation cost at fair value for all stock based awards  net of the estimated impact of forfeited awards 
the company has not granted stock options subsequent to fiscal the fair values of options were estimated using a black scholes option pricing model 
in addition to stock options  key employees and or non employee directors are eligible to receive performance shares and restricted stock 
upon the adoption of the company s incentive compensation plan in february  the fair value of performance shares and restricted stock granted under the new plan is based on the company s closing stock price on the grant date 
the terms of performance share awards allow the recipients of such awards to earn a variable number of shares based on the achievement of the performance goals specified in the awards 
stock based compensation expense associated with performance share awards is recognized based on management s best estimates of the achievement of the performance goals specified in such awards and the resulting number of shares that are expected to be earned 
the company evaluates on a quarterly basis the progress towards achieving the performance criteria 
the cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the estimated number of performance share awards expected to be earned is recognized as compensation cost or as a reduction of cost in the period of the revised estimate 
compensation expense for restricted stock is recognized ratably over the vesting period 
forfeitures of awards are estimated at the time of grant and stock based compensation cost is recognized only for those awards expected to vest 
the company uses historical experience to estimate projected forfeitures 
the company recognizes the cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the forfeiture rate  or actual forfeitures  as compensation cost or as a reduction of cost in the period of the revision 
if revisions are made to management s assumptions and estimates or if actual results vary considerably from those that are expected  stock based compensation expense could change significantly  impacting the company s results of operations or financial condition 
further information regarding the company s stock based awards is presented under the footnote stock based compensation in item of this annual report on form k 
results of operations comparison of the fiscal years ended september  and september revenues for fiscal were million  a decrease of million  or  compared with revenues of million for fiscal the medical products segment decreased by million due to the decline in the spherz selling price and shipments and the radiation measurement segment increased million on higher international sales  primarily of equipment  offset by declines in domestic badge revenues 
cost of sales for fiscal was million  an increase of million  or  compared with cost of sales of million for fiscal the cost of sales increase was due to the it expenses related to the company s it platform enhancement that went live a little over a year ago 
increased support costs of million  increased it systems depreciation of million as well as international cost increases of million on higher equipment shipments 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million  a decrease of million  compared with selling  general and administrative expenses of million for fiscal increases in customer service support of million as well as increased it systems depreciation of million were offset by prior years it system enhancement costs of million 
service cost reductions in medical physics of million offset increases in medical products of million and radiation measurement of million 
during the third quarter of fiscal  it became apparent that anticipated revenue trends in our medical products segment were not being achieved to the extent forecasted 
early budget reviews also indicated future sales growth may be less than expected 
the company updated the forecasted results of operations for our medical products operating segment based on the most recent financial results and our best estimates of future operations 
the updated forecast reflects a slower growth in revenues for the medical products segment due to anticipated continued pricing pressures from certain competitors greater than the anticipated growth from existing and new product sales 
as a result of these lowered actual and forecasted results  the company performed a goodwill impairment test  which indicated the value of the medical products goodwill was less than its book value 
the company recorded a million pretax charge for the impairment of goodwill to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in the company s medical products segment 
the impairment charge was non cash in nature and does not affect the company s liquidity or debt covenant compliance 
acquisition  reorganization and nonrecurring costs were million and consisted of million in corporate reorganization expenses  million reserves for escheatment liability and million of costs related to acquisitions 
operating income for fiscal was million  a decrease of million  or  compared with operating income of million for fiscal the decrease in operating income was due primarily to the million goodwill impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in our medical products segment 
the remaining variance of million to prior year relates to medical products revenue decrease of million offset by million of increased radiation measurement revenue 
increased cost of sales due to the it platform enhancement of million and increased international costs of million offset by cost savings of million and selling  general and administrative expenses higher by million 
equity in income of joint ventures for fiscal was million  an increase of million  or  compared with equity in income of joint ventures of million for fiscal interest expense for fiscal was million  an increase of million  or  compared with interest expense of million for fiscal the effective tax rate was  or million benefit  and  or million expense  for fiscal and  respectively 
the fiscal effective tax rate decreased due primarily to an increased realization of certain us tax credits and mix of earnings by jurisdiction 
net income for fiscal was million  a decrease of million  or  compared with net income of million for fiscal the decrease in net income was due primarily to a goodwill impairment charge of million  decreased medical products revenue of million offset by million of increased radiation measurement revenue 
increased cost of sales was due primarily to the it platform enhancement of million and increased international costs of million and higher selling  general and administrative expense of million offset by cost savings of million 
income taxes offset the decreases by million 
ebitda for fiscal was million  a decrease compared with million in the prior year 
the decrease was due primarily to a non cash charge for goodwill impairment 
adjusted ebitda for fiscal was million  a decrease compared with million in the prior year 
a reconciliation of net income to ebitda  adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and non gaap diluted earnings per share is included herein under part ii  section radiation measurement segment radiation measurement revenues for fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  compared with revenues of million for fiscal revenues increased million primarily on higher international equipment sales of million due to tenders in china and emea while domestic inlight equipment decreases were offset by increases in radwatch products 
in addition  the segment had decreased domestic service badge revenue of million and foreign exchange losses of million 
radiation measurement operating income for fiscal was million  an increase of million  or  compared with operating income of million for fiscal the revenue increase of million was partially offset by it platform enhancement increases of million  it systems depreciation of million and increased international equipment costs of million on higher sales and increased customer service support of million offset by prior year non recurring acquisition costs of million and asset abandonments of million and prior year it platform expenses of million and decreased material costs of million 
corporate expenses for shared functions are recognized in radiation measurement segment where they have been reported historically 
acquisition  reorganization and nonrecurring costs are not allocated to the segment 
as the company s business model evolves in increased complexity  management may determine it will be necessary to change this reporting practice to reflect any appropriate allocations 
medical physics segment medical physics revenues were million for both fiscal and medical physics operating income for fiscal was million  an increase of million  or  compared with operating income of million for fiscal the increase in operating income was primarily due to operating efficiencies in the core medical physics business as well as segment administration cost reductions 
medical products segment medical products revenues for fiscal were million  a decrease of million  or  compared with revenues of million for fiscal the medical products segment decreased by million due to the decline in the spherz selling price and shipments 
while the company continues to experience pricing pressure on its spherz product line  the company currently anticipates that the planned expansion of certain other product lines in its medical products segment may mitigate the impact of the spherz pricing pressure on the results of operations of its medical products segment 
medical products operating loss for fiscal was million  a decrease of million  or  compared with operating income of million for fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to the third quarter goodwill impairment charge of million and the revenue decrease of million due to the decline in spherz selling price and shipments and additional tradename amortization of million 
comparison of the fiscal years ended september  and september revenues for fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  compared with revenues of million for fiscal the medical physics segment and the radiation measurement segment contributed an increase of million and million  respectively 
the contribution of the new medical products segment increased revenues by million 
consolidated revenue for the fiscal year ended september  was negatively affected million by currency fluctuation  as compared with the prior year  principally due to weakness in the euro against the us dollar 
cost of sales for fiscal was million  an increase of million  or  compared with cost of sales of million for fiscal the increase in cost of sales was primarily driven by million associated with acquired companies purchased subsequent to the prior year  million in cost of sales associated with sales from the company s ongoing military and first responder initiatives  million in cost of sales associated with international revenue increases  million increase in depreciation related to the company s it platform enhancements and the impact of the mix of lower margin equipment sales within radiation measurement 
gross margins were for fiscal  compared with for fiscal the decrease in the gross margin rate was primarily due to a shift in the mix of cost of sales resulting from the overall growth of the medical physics segment  which has lower margins compared to the radiation measurement and medical products segments  along with lower margin equipment sales  including radwatch system sales to the military and first responder markets  in the radiation measurement segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  compared with selling  general and administrative expenses of million for fiscal the selling  general and administrative expenses increase was due to million associated with acquired companies purchased subsequent to the prior year  million due to performance against incentive compensation plans associated with improved operating performance in fiscal versus targets  million in expenses related to the company s it platform enhancements  million for investment in research and development in support of military and first responder initiatives  million investment in customer facing organizations and million for expenses supporting international growth 
for fiscal  total operating expenses were million compared to million for fiscal before million of non recurring acquisition expenses  million for asset abandonments  million of it platform enhancement related expenses and million of non cash stock based compensation expenses  were million  or of total revenues for fiscal this compares with the million  or of total revenues  reported for fiscal  before million of non recurring acquisition expenses  million of it platform enhancement related expenses  and million of non cash stock based compensation expenses 
operating income for fiscal was million  a decrease of million  or  compared with operating income of million for fiscal the decrease in operating income was primarily driven by a million increase in non recurring acquisition and reorganization costs and asset abandonment charges incurred in fiscal an additional decline of million in radiation measurement operating income  due primarily to the higher operating expenses  was partially offset by an increase in operating income of million in the medical physics segment and the addition of the medical products segment which contributed million in operating income 
operating income  adjusted for non recurring acquisition and reorganization expenses  asset abandonment charges  it platform enhancement related expenses  and non cash stock based compensation expenses  for fiscal was million  a increase compared with operating income  adjusted for these items on a relative basis  of million for fiscal equity in income of joint ventures for fiscal was million  an increase of million  or  from the prior year 
other expense  including interest expense  for fiscal was million  an increase of million from the prior year  due to interest expense associated with borrowings to acquire izi in the first fiscal quarter of the effective tax rate was and for fiscal and  respectively 
the fiscal effective tax rate decreased due primarily to an increased realization of the foreign tax credit and an increased research and development credit by a foreign affiliate 
net income for fiscal was million  a decrease of million  or  compared with million for fiscal excluding the costs associated with the acquisitions and reorganization costs  asset abandonment charges  it platform enhancement and non cash stock based compensation  adjusted net income was million  as compared to million in the prior year 
the resulting adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended september  were per share  excluding per diluted share of acquisition and reorganization costs  asset abandonment charges  it platform enhancement  and non cash stock based compensation expenses 
this compares with per share  excluding per diluted share of acquisition  it platform enhancement  and non cash stock based compensation expenses  for the fiscal year ended september ebitda for fiscal was million  a decrease compared with million in the prior year 
the decrease was due primarily to the increase in non recurring acquisition and reorganization costs  asset abandonment charges  it platform enhancement and non cash stock based compensation expenses 
adjusted ebitda for fiscal was million  an increase compared with million in the prior year 
a reconciliation of net income to ebitda  adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and non gaap diluted earnings per share is included herein under part ii  section the following is a discussion of the company s segment operating results 
radiation measurement segment radiation measurement revenues for fiscal were million  an increase of  or million  from fiscal of million 
of the increase  million was related to the impact of higher equipment sales from the company s ongoing initiatives with the military market 
international radiation measurement revenues increased million  or  from the prior year  driven primarily by organic growth in most regions  including both equipment sales and service revenues  partially offset by million of foreign exchange losses 
radiation measurement operating income for fiscal decreased to million  a decrease from million in the prior year  impacted by the increase and mix in lower margin equipment sales both domestically and internationally  including radwatch system sales to the military  and higher selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative costs for fiscal increased  or million  to million 
the increase was due primarily to a million increase in non recurring acquisition and reorganization costs  asset abandonment charges  it platform enhancement and non cash stock based compensation related expenses  a million increase in compensation costs  consistent with operating performance expectations and timing of short term and long term incentive plans  a million increase in research and development activities in connection with the military and first responder initiatives  million of increased spending to support international revenue growth  a million investment in customer facing organizations  a million increase in employee benefit plans and medical expenses  million of increased professional fees  and a million increase due to the company s it platform enhancement 
radiation measurement operating income for fiscal was negatively affected million  as compared with the prior year  by currency fluctuation  principally due to weakness in the euro and the real against the us dollar 
radiation measurement operating income  adjusted for the impact of acquisition related transaction expenses  asset abandonment charges  it platform enhancement expenses  and non cash stock based compensation expenses  for fiscal decreased  or million  to million compared with adjusted operating income of million for fiscal corporate expenses for shared functions are recognized in the radiation measurement segment where they have been reported historically 
acquisition and reorganization costs are not allocated to the segments 
as the company s business model evolves in increased complexity  management may determine it necessary to change this reporting practice to reflect any appropriate allocations 
medical physics segment medical physics revenues for fiscal of million increased  or million  from fiscal of million on million of organic growth and million due to the impact of acquired companies 
the medical physics segment operating income of million  or of revenues  increased million as compared to a loss of million  or of revenues  for fiscal the improvement in operating income was primarily due to operating efficiencies in the core medical physics business and higher episodic equipment commissioning sales leveraging a relatively fixed cost structure  as well as higher volume sales inclusive of acquired companies 
medical products segment with the acquisition of izi on november   the company now operates in a third reportable segment  medical products 
revenues for the period from the date of acquisition through september  were million 
medical products operating income was million or of revenues for the same period 
given the acquisition of izi was completed during the first quarter of fiscal  there is no direct comparison to the prior fiscal year 
fiscal outlook the company s business plan for fiscal currently anticipates aggregate revenues for the year to be in the range of to million and reflects the uncertainty of government funding during fiscal for the military equipment sales opportunities the company has developed 
the business plan also anticipates an effective tax rate for the full fiscal year to be within a range of percent to percent 
based upon the above assumptions  the company anticipates reported net income for fiscal in the range of to million and adjusted ebitda expected for fiscal in the range of to million
