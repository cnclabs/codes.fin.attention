item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview the us economic expansion has continued at a slow to moderate pace through the end of continued growth in retail sales  particularly among e commerce retailers  has provided for expansion in the overall us small package delivery market  however  recent weakness in manufacturing activity  combined with the uneven nature of the overall economic recovery  has negatively impacted the small package delivery market 
given these trends  our products most aligned with business to consumer shipments have experienced the strongest growth  while our business to business volume continues to lag overall gdp growth 
outside of the us  economic growth has slowed considerably due to volatility in world markets and fiscal austerity measures  particularly in europe 
this slower global economic growth has created an environment in which customers are more likely to trade down from premium express products to standard delivery products 
additionally  the uneven nature of economic growth worldwide has led to shifting trade patterns whereby transcontinental trade is being pressured  but intra regional trade is continuing to grow 
these circumstances have led us to adjust our air capacity and cost structure in our transportation network to the prevailing volume mix levels 
our broad portfolio of product offerings and the flexibilities inherent in our transportation network have helped us adapt to these changing trends 
while the worldwide economic environment has been challenging in  we have continued to undertake initiatives to improve yield management  increase operational efficiency and contain costs across all segments 
continued deployment of technology improvements should lead to further gains in our operational efficiency  flexibility and reliability  thus restraining cost increases and improving margins 
in our international package segment  we have adjusted our air network and utilized newly constructed or expanded operating facilities to improve time in transit for shipments in each region 
we have also continued to optimize our aircraft network to leverage the new route authority we have gained over the last several years and to take full advantage of faster growing trade lanes 
additionally  in the first quarter of  we acquired kiala sa  which will expand our service offerings for business to consumer deliveries in europe

defined benefit plans mark to market charge in  and  we incurred pre tax mark to market losses of billion  million and million  respectively  on a consolidated basis billion  million and million after tax  respectively on our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans related to the remeasurement of plan assets and liabilities recognized outside of a corridor 
these mark to market losses for  and primarily resulted from decreases in the discount rates used to value our projected benefit obligations in each year  which more than offset the impact of the actual rate of return on plan assets exceeding the expected rate of return 
these losses  which were recorded in compensation and benefits expense in our statements of consolidated income  impacted each of our three reporting segments for  and multiemployer pension plan withdrawal charge in  we recognized an million pre tax charge million after tax for the establishment of a withdrawal liability related to our withdrawal from the new england teamsters and trucking industry pension fund new england pension fund  a multiemployer pension plan 
this charge was recorded in compensation and benefits expense in our statements of consolidated income  and impacted our us domestic package segment 
restructuring charge in  we streamlined the management structure in our us domestic package segment  and incurred a restructuring charge associated with this reorganization 
this pre tax charge totaled million million after tax  and was recorded in compensation and benefits expense in our statements of consolidated income 
the charge reflects the value of voluntary retirement benefits and severance benefits  as well as the accelerated recognition of unvested stock compensation 
gain on sales of businesses in  we sold our ups logistics technologies business unit within our supply chain freight segment  and recognized a pre tax gain of million million after tax 
also in  we sold a specialized transportation business in germany within our supply chain freight segment  and incurred a pre tax loss on the sale of million million after tax  which includes a fair value adjustment loss due to a financial guarantee associated with this business sale 
the gains and losses associated with these transactions are recorded in other operating expenses in our statements of consolidated income 
gains on real estate transactions in  we recognized a net million pre tax gain million after tax on a consolidated basis on certain real estate transactions consisting of a million pre tax gain in our supply chain freight segment  and a million pre tax loss in our us domestic package segment 
in  we recognized a pre tax gain of million million after tax on the sale of real estate within our us domestic package segment 
the gains and losses associated with these transactions are recorded in other operating expenses in our statements of consolidated income 
charge for change in tax filing status for german subsidiary in  we changed the tax status of a german subsidiary that was taxable in the us and its local jurisdiction to one that is solely taxed in its local jurisdiction 
as a result of this change in tax status  we recorded a non cash charge of million to income tax expense  which resulted primarily from the write off of related deferred tax assets which will not be realizable following the change in tax status

and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations revenue the change in overall revenue was impacted by the following factors for the years ended december  and  compared with the corresponding prior year periods volume rates product mix fuel surcharge total revenue change revenue change drivers volume compared to our overall volume increased in compared with  largely due to continued solid growth in retail e commerce and strong customer demand for our lightweight products 
business to consumer shipments  which represent slightly over of total us domestic package volume  grew rapidly and drove growth in both air and ground shipments  however  business to business volume remained relatively flat in compared with this can be attributed to multiple trends that have prevailed over the past few years  including the migration of traditional retail to online retail  the lack of growth in small and medium size enterprises and reduced business investments attributed to policy uncertainty 
among our air products  next day air letter and package volume both experienced solid increases in  with particular growth in our next day air saver products 
the higher volume for our deferred air products  which increased for the year  was primarily due to healthy demand for our residential package services 
the overall growth in our air products was driven primarily by business to consumer shipments from e commerce retailers  while our business to business air volume declined slightly 
the increase in ground volume in was driven by our lightweight service offerings  including surepost  which target low cost  non urgent residential deliveries 
volume for these lightweight products grew significantly  and accounted for approximately of the total increase in ground shipments 
outside of these lightweight service offerings  volume for our traditional ground residential services also experienced an increase in overall ground volume growth continues to be driven by business to consumer shipping activity from e commerce retailers  while our business to business ground volume was flat in compared with compared to our overall volume increased slightly in compared with  and was largely impacted by the slowing us economy during the first three quarters of the year 
business to consumer shipments  which represented approximately of total us domestic package volume  experienced stronger growth than business to business volume 
volume growth accelerated in the fourth quarter  with average daily volume increasing over the fourth quarter of among our air products  we experienced a increase in next day and second day air package volume  as a result of retail sales growth  with particular growth in our next day air saver product 
air letter volume declined  largely due to weakness in the financial and other service industries 
within ground  our lightweight products experienced robust growth during during the fourth quarter of  volume growth accelerated to and in our deferred and ground products  respectively  compared with the fourth quarter of these increases were primarily driven by higher business to consumer shipment activity during the holiday season 
rates and product mix compared to overall revenue per piece increased in compared with  and was impacted by changes in base rates  product mix and fuel surcharge rates  as discussed below 

table of contents united parcel service  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations revenue per piece for our next day air and deferred products decreased in compared with  as declines in fuel surcharge rates and product mix changes more than offset the impact of a base rate increase that took effect in early changes in product mix negatively impacted revenue per piece for our air products  as our lightweight service offerings accounted for a larger portion of our overall air volume in compared with  and our next day air saver volume continued to grow at a faster rate than our premium next day air services 
ground revenue per piece increased in compared with  primarily due to a base rate increase that took effect in early  however  this was partially offset by product mix changes  as strong volume growth in our lightweight service offerings resulted in these relatively lower yielding products accounting for a greater portion of our overall volume in  compared with revenue per piece for our ground and air products was positively impacted by an increase in base rates that took effect on january  we increased the base rates on ups next day air  ups nd day air and ups day select  and on ups ground  while reducing our fuel surcharge indices discussed further below 
other pricing changes included an increase in the residential surcharge  and an increase in the delivery area surcharge on certain residential and commercial services 
these rate changes are customary and occur on an annual basis 
compared to overall revenue per piece increased for our ground and air products during due to a combination of base price increases and fuel surcharge rate changes  which are discussed further below 
the overall revenue per piece increase was also positively affected by our focus on revenue management initiatives 
in addition  the revenue per piece increase for our air products was positively impacted by the overall mix shift from letters to packages 
comparing the fourth quarter of with  the average revenue per piece increase slowed to due to the higher volume of lighter weight business to consumer packages 
revenue per piece for our ground and air products was also impacted by an increase in base rates that took effect on january  we increased the base rates on ups next day air  ups nd day air  and ups day select  and on ups ground  while reducing our fuel surcharge indices discussed further below 
other pricing changes included an increase in the residential surcharge  and an increase in the delivery area surcharge on both residential and commercial services to certain zip codes 
fuel surcharges ups applies a fuel surcharge on our domestic air and ground services 
the air fuel surcharge is based on the us department of energy s doe gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene type jet fuel  while the ground fuel surcharge is based on the doe s on highway diesel fuel price 
based on published rates  the average fuel surcharge rates for domestic air and ground products were as follows year ended december  point change next day air deferred ground in connection with our base rate increases on january  and january   we modified the fuel surcharge on air and ground services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by and  respectively  each year 
in  these index reductions offset the increase in jet and diesel fuel prices  resulting in a small decrease in the average air fuel surcharge rate and no change in the average ground surcharge rate 
the increases in the air and ground fuel surcharge rates were due to the significant increases in jet and diesel fuel prices  but partially offset by the reductions in the index on both the air and ground surcharges 
total domestic fuel surcharge revenue increased and million in and  respectively  primarily due to volume growth in and the higher fuel surcharge rates in

and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operating expenses compared to overall adjusted operating expenses for the segment increased million in compared with this increase was primarily due to pick up and delivery costs  which grew million  as well as the cost of operating our domestic integrated air and ground network  which increased million for the year 
the growth in pick up and delivery and network costs was largely due to increased volume and higher employee compensation costs  which were impacted by a union contractual wage increase package driver wage rates rose  an increase in driver hours up and increased employee health care costs 
these increases were partially offset by reductions in indirect operating costs of million in  largely due to a decrease in the expense for management incentive awards 
cost increases have been moderated as we adjust our air and ground networks to better match higher volume levels  and utilize technology to increase package sorting efficiency 
improved delivery densities  particularly for our residential products  have also contained increases in cost 
these network improvements allowed us to process the volume growth more efficiently 
some of the primary drivers of expense increased at a slower rate than the growth in volume  including average daily direct labor hours up  aircraft block hours up and miles driven up  resulting in the total cost per piece increasing only 
compared to overall adjusted operating expenses for the segment increased million in compared with  while the total adjusted cost per piece increased for the year 
a large component of this increase related to the cost of operating our domestic integrated air and ground network  which increased million in largely due to higher fuel costs  as well as an increase in aircraft repair and maintenance expenses and higher rates passed to us from outside transportation carriers  primarily railroads 
pickup and delivery costs increased million in compared to  primarily as a result of higher fuel prices and a union contractual driver wage increase 
cost increases were mitigated due to network efficiencies that we achieved  as we adjusted our air and ground networks to better match volume levels  and continued to utilize our expanded worldport facility to operate larger aircraft and to increase package sorting efficiency 
these network efficiency improvements resulted in a reduction in total labor hours and a reduction in miles driven in compared with increased delivery densities as a result of improved planning and technology  and growth in our surepost product  also contained increases in cost 
operating profit and margin compared to the increase in adjusted operating profit in compared with was largely due to the revenue growth and the achievement of significant operating leverage  but partially offset by the impact of having two less operating days during overall volume growth allowed us to better leverage our transportation network  resulting in productivity improvements and better pick up and delivery density  which favorably impacted our operating margins  however  these trends were somewhat offset by changes in customer and product mix  which combined to adversely affect our revenue per piece 
additionally  hurricane sandy negatively impacted operating profit by approximately million in these factors drove a basis point increase in our adjusted operating margin in  compared with  resulting in the increase in adjusted operating profit 
compared to higher adjusted operating profit during compared with was driven by the increased network efficiencies  combined with large improvements in revenue per piece and a small increase in volume 
fourth quarter adjusted operating profit was particularly strong  with adjusted operating margins of in comparison to in the fourth quarter of significant volume growth in the business to consumer sector  along with cost control efforts and network efficiencies  were the primary factors for the fourth quarter performance

asia to us export volume increased  and was favorably impacted by new technology sector product launches from several customers 
intra regional export volume increased in europe and asia  as more regional sourcing by customers led to growth in our transborder products 
us export volume declined  particularly exports from the us to europe  as economic weakness within the european union negatively impacted volume 
additionally  overall export volume continued to shift towards our less premium products  such as transborder standard and worldwide expedited  as compared with our premium express products  such as worldwide express  primarily due to the impact of the weaker economic conditions on our customers internationally 
domestic volume decreased during compared with  and was negatively impacted by economic weakness across europe  however  this was partially offset by domestic volume growth in the uk and canada 
compared to export volume increased in compared to  primarily due to growth in key markets in europe and the americas 
our transborder products experienced significant volume growth  particularly in key countries within europe 
volume for our premium worldwide express and worldwide expedited products increased as well  particularly in the asia to europe  europe to americas and europe to asia export trade lanes 
additionally  intra asia export volume experienced solid growth during compared with  and was impacted by the continued economic growth in asia overall 
our export volume growth slowed in the latter half of  largely due to decelerating growth in exports out of china and the rest of asia  as well as difficult comparisons with a relatively strong latter half of domestic volume increases were driven by continued growth in key markets  including germany  france and poland 
rates and product mix compared to total average revenue per piece increased in on a currency adjusted basis  and was impacted by base rate increases  as well as changes in product mix and fuel surcharge rates  which are discussed below 
currency adjusted export revenue per piece decreased for the year  as the shift in product mix from our premium express products to our standard products more than offset the increase in base rates 
additionally  currency adjusted export revenue per piece was adversely impacted by a shortening of average trade lanes  as we experienced greater volume growth among our lower yielding transborder and trade direct products relative to our higher yielding transcontinental volume 
currency adjusted domestic revenue per piece increased for the year  largely due to base rate increases

the fuel surcharges for air products originating outside the united states are indexed to the doe gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene type jet fuel  while the fuel surcharges for ground products originating outside the united states are indexed to fuel prices in the international region or country where the shipment takes place 
total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by and million in and  respectively  due to higher fuel surcharge rates caused by increased fuel prices as well as an increase in international air volume 
operating expenses compared to overall adjusted operating expenses for the segment decreased million in compared with the largest component of this decrease related to the cost of operating our international integrated air and ground network  which decreased million 
this decrease primarily resulted from cost control initiatives  including a reduction in average daily aircraft block hours resulting from ongoing modifications to our air network 
the cost of pick up and delivery decreased million  largely due to the impact of currency exchange rate movements and in country cost control initiatives 
partially offsetting these cost reductions was an increase in indirect operating costs  which increased million in compared with this increase was impacted by our investment in enhanced security screening for our international locations and expenses associated with business acquisition activities  including our proposed acquisition of tnt express nv see note to the consolidated financial statements as well as the february acquisition of kiala sa excluding the impact of currency exchange rate changes  the total cost per piece for the segment increased in compared with compared to overall adjusted operating expenses for the segment increased billion in compared with the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes resulted in an adverse impact on operating expense comparisons between and of million 
excluding the impact of currency exchange rate changes  the total adjusted cost per piece for the segment increased for the year 
the increase in adjusted operating expenses  excluding the impact of currency  was largely due to the increased cost of operating our international integrated air and ground network  and also higher pick up and delivery costs 
network costs increased million for the year  largely due to higher fuel costs and increased block hours  as well as an increase in aircraft repair and maintenance expenses 
pick up and delivery costs increased million for the year  primarily as a result of higher fuel prices and increased package volume 
operating profit and margin compared to adjusted operating margin declined basis points in compared with  as the product mix shift from our premium express products to our standard products in reduced margins in this segment 
additionally  the volume declines in certain key transcontinental trade lanes during portions of also adversely impacted margins  since these routes have a larger cost infrastructure relative to the remainder of the international package segment to support the air express volume in each region

the overall increase in adjusted operating profit was largely due to the volume and revenue per piece increases previously discussed  however  the impact of these items was largely offset by excess capacity and the adverse impact of fuel prices and currency exchange rate movements 
volume softness in the asia to us trade lane in the latter half of resulted in excess transportation capacity  which negatively affected margins while our transportation network was being adjusted for the slowing demand 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates net of our hedging programs resulted in an adverse impact on operating profit comparisons between and of million

the reduction in rates in the air forwarding business was largely due to industry overcapacity in key trade lanes  particularly the asia outbound market 
in our logistics products  revenue increased in as we experienced robust growth in our mail services and health care solutions 
the improved revenue in our health care solutions business was driven by organic growth as well as the december acquisition of pieffe group 
freight revenue increased million for the year  driven by an increase in ltl revenue per hundredweight and in gross weight hauled  however  these factors were somewhat offset by a decline in average daily ltl shipments 
the increase in ltl revenue per hundredweight was largely due to our focus on yield management and profitable revenue growth  as well as a general rate increase averaging that took effect on july   covering non contractual shipments in the united states  canada and mexico 
the decline in average daily ltl shipments in was impacted by increased competitiveness in the ltl market and the slowdown in the us economy

compared to forwarding and logistics revenue increased million in compared with  primarily due to growth in our logistics services  where we experienced solid growth in our mail services  retail and health care solutions 
forwarding revenue decreased primarily due to volume and tonnage declines in our air and ocean forwarding businesses  as well as lower third party transportation carrier rates 
the tonnage decrease was mainly the result of revenue management initiatives that improve the matching of customer pricing with market conditions  as well as the impact of the global economic slowdown 
freight revenue increased million in compared with  primarily due to growth in ltl shipments  an increase in base rates  and increased fuel surcharge rates 
ltl shipments per day increased in  largely due to improving ltl market conditions in the first half of the year and an increase in market share 
however  volume declined in the latter half of the year  and was impacted by our focus on yield management and also due to the overall ltl market being adversely impacted by the slowing economy 
ltl revenue per hundredweight increased  primarily as a result of a base rate increase that took effect during the year  negotiated increases on existing contract rates and higher fuel surcharge rates  as total fuel surcharge revenue increased million for the year driven by higher diesel fuel prices 
an increase in base prices took effect on august   as our freight unit increased minimum charge  ltl and tl rates an average of  covering non contractual shipments in the united states  canada and mexico

operating expenses compared to forwarding and logistics adjusted operating expenses decreased million in compared with  due to several factors 
purchased transportation expense fell by million in  primarily due to lower rates charged to us by third party transportation carriers though this briefly reversed in the fourth quarter 
compensation and benefits expense declined by million in  largely due to reduced payroll and lower management incentive compensation costs

these factors were  however  partially offset by productivity improvements 
adjusted operating expenses for the other businesses within supply chain freight increased million in compared with compared to forwarding and logistics adjusted operating expenses were flat in compared with purchased transportation expense declined by million in  due to lower air freight volume as well as lower rates passed to us from third party transportation carriers 
the reduction in third party carrier rates was largely due to over capacity in the asia to us trade lane that began in the latter half of and continued into the first half of this reduction in purchased transportation costs was offset by increases in several other expense categories  including other occupancy costs  depreciation and amortization  repairs and maintenance  and other expenses 
freight operating expenses increased million for on an adjusted basis  with the total cost per ltl shipment increasing for the year 
the two largest components of this increase relate to the cost of operating our linehaul network  which increased million in  and pick up  delivery and dock costs  which increased million for the year 
we incurred higher fuel costs operating our vehicle fleet  as well as higher fuel surcharge rates passed to us from outside transportation carriers  as a result of higher diesel fuel prices and increased volume 
additionally  compensation and benefit costs increased primarily as a result of higher pension and health care costs  and effective wage increases of for drivers in our linehaul network and for drivers and dock workers in our pick up and delivery network 
these expense increases were somewhat offset by improved productivity measures  including pick up and delivery stops per hour  dock bills per hour and improved linehaul network utilization 
expenses for the other businesses within supply chain freight increased million in compared to  and the increases were spread among several operating expense categories and business units 
operating profit and margin compared to adjusted operating profit for the forwarding and logistics unit decreased by million in compared with this decrease was primarily due to reduced profitability in our international air forwarding business  as european economic uncertainty  slower growth in china and a sluggish us economy all contributed to a reduction in overall air freight market demand 
this lower demand pressured the rates we charge to our customers  which more than offset the reduced rates we incur from third party transportation carriers  and thereby led to a decline in our operating margin 
operating profit for our logistics business declined in compared with  largely due to increased depreciation expense resulting from the continued investment in technology and facilities for our global health care business 
adjusted operating profit for our freight unit increased million in compared with  as gains in productivity including pick up and delivery stops per hour  dock bills per hour and linehaul network utilization as well as improved yields  more than offset the overall decline in volume

the increase in service and interest costs for company sponsored plans was largely due to continued service accruals and lower discount rates 
health and welfare costs increased million in compared with  largely due to higher medical claims and the impact of several provisions of the patient protection and affordable care act of the expense associated with our self insurance programs for workers compensation claims increased million in compared with insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported workers compensation claims  as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not reported 
insurance reserves also take into account a number of factors including our history of claim losses  payroll growth and the impact of safety improvement initiatives 
the increase in expense in was largely impacted by increased payroll estimates  changes in state workers compensation laws  and medical inflation 
compared to employee payroll costs increased million in compared with  largely due to contractual union wage rate increases that took effect under our collective bargaining agreement with the teamsters  but partially offset by a decline in union labor hours 
management payroll costs declined slightly  primarily due to a lower management incentive award 
adjusted benefits expense increased million in compared with  primarily due to higher employee health and welfare costs and expense associated with our self insurance for workers compensation claims  but partially offset by a decline in pension expense 
these factors are discussed further as follows employee health and welfare program costs increased million in  and were impacted by higher required union plan contribution rates and general health care inflation 
the expense associated with our self insurance programs for workers compensation claims increased by million in in  we experienced more favorable actuarial expense adjustments compared with  thus leading to the increase in expense in adjusted pension expense decreased million in due to several factors 
most significantly  contributions to the company sponsored pension plans in increased the expected return on assets used for expense calculation purposes 
the increase in the expected return on assets more than offset increased service and interest costs due to a decline in discount rates  resulting in a net reduction in pension expense 
this was partially offset by higher contribution rates for multiemployer pension plans  as well as the reinstatement of matching contributions to our primary employee defined contribution savings plan

additionally  aircraft maintenance expense declined due to a reduction in the number of scheduled maintenance checks for our airbus a f  boeing f and boeing md f aircraft 
compared to the increase in repairs and maintenance expense was largely due to aircraft maintenance costs  which increased million in compared with this increase resulted from an increase in flight hours due to higher air volume  additional scheduled maintenance checks and higher contractual maintenance rates

compared to the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in was primarily the result of a reduction in depreciation expense on technology equipment and software 
this decline was primarily related to certain technology hardware and capitalized software becoming fully depreciated 
purchased transportation compared to the increase in purchased transportation expense charged to us by third party air  ocean and truck carriers in compared with was impacted by several factors 
we incurred a million increase in purchased transportation expense for in our us domestic package segment  primarily due to higher fees paid to the us postal service associated with the strong volume growth in our surepost product  and higher rates passed to us from rail carriers 
this was partially offset by a million decrease in expense in our freight forwarding business  largely as a result of lower rates charged to us by third party air carriers 
compared to the increase in purchased transportation in was caused by a combination of higher volume  as well as increased fuel surcharges and base rates charged to us by third party air  ocean and truck carriers across all segments 
the combination of these factors increased expense by million in additionally  we incurred a million increase in expense in for the use of rail carriers  which was due primarily to higher rates and fuel surcharges  as well as increased volumes 
the remaining increase in expense for was primarily due to foreign currency exchange rate changes 
fuel compared to the fuel expense increase in compared with was largely due to higher fuel prices  which increased expense by million  however  this was partially offset by lower usage of fuel products  which decreased expense by million 
the lower fuel usage was largely due to the decrease in total aircraft block hours and vehicle miles driven 
compared to the increase in fuel expense in compared with was primarily caused by higher prices for jet a fuel  diesel and unleaded gasoline  which increased expense by million 
higher usage of these products in our operations accounted for the remaining increase in expense of million in other occupancy compared to other occupancy expense decreased in compared with  primarily due to reductions in personal property and real estate taxes combined with a decrease in utilities expense 
the relatively warm winter in the united states  combined with lower natural gas prices  helped to reduce heating and snow removal costs in our facilities during the early months of compared to other occupancy expense increased in compared with  primarily due to an increase in utilities expense resulting from increased electricity costs in our facilities 
the remainder of the increase is primarily due to higher rent expense resulting from increased rates on warehouses

these increases were partially offset by a reduction in employee relocation expenses and a decline in package claims expense 
additionally  adjusted other expenses were reduced by a million gain on the sale of a distribution facility in our supply chain freight segment

investment income and interest expense the following table sets forth investment income and interest expense for the years ended december   and in millions year ended december  change investment income n a interest expense investment income compared to the decrease in investment income in compared with was primarily caused by an million decline in fair value adjustments and an million decline in realized gains on sales of investments 
these declines were partially offset by an increase in interest income  largely due to having a higher average balance of interest earning cash and investments in our portfolio in compared with compared to the increase in investment income in compared with was caused by a combination of factors 
during  we realized million in net gains on the sales of auction rate securities  preferred equity securities and an s p index fund  as well as a mark to market gain on investments 
in  we recorded a million impairment on certain asset backed auction rate securities  which resulted from provisions that allowed the issuers of the securities to subordinate our holdings to newly issued debt or to tender for the securities at less than their par value 
additionally in  we recorded an million loss on the sale of auction rate securities 
the remaining change in investment income was caused by a lower yield earned on our invested assets  however  this was largely offset by a higher average balance of interest earning investments in our portfolio 
interest expense compared to interest expense increased in compared with  largely due to a higher average balance of debt outstanding  as well as a higher effective interest rate incurred on our debt 
the higher effective interest rate largely resulted from two factors having a greater proportion of fixed rate debt outstanding relative to lower yielding variable rate debt and an increase in the interest rate indices underlying our variable rate debt and swaps in additionally  interest expense increased in compared with due to unfavorable fair value adjustments on interest rate swaps that have not been designated as hedges  as well as the imputation of interest expense on the multiemployer pension withdrawal liability related to the new england pension fund

cash from operating activities remained strong throughout the to time period 
operating cash flow was favorably impacted in  compared with  by lower contributions into our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans  however  this was partially offset by changes in our working capital position  which was impacted by overall growth in the business 
the change in the cash flows for income tax receivables and payables in and was primarily related to the timing of discretionary pension contributions during  as discussed further in the following paragraph 
except for discretionary or accelerated fundings of our plans  contributions to our company sponsored pension plans have largely varied based on whether any minimum funding requirements are present for individual pension plans

the remaining contributions in the through period were largely due to contributions to our international pension plans and us postretirement medical benefit plans

as of december   the total of our worldwide holdings of cash and cash equivalents was billion 
approximately billion of this amount was held in european subsidiaries with the intended purpose of completing the acquisition of tnt express nv see note to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding this portion of cash held outside the us for acquisition related purposes  approximately of the remaining cash and cash equivalents are held by foreign subsidiaries throughout the year 
the amount of cash held by our us and foreign subsidiaries fluctuates throughout the year due to a variety of factors  including the timing of cash receipts and disbursements in the normal course of business 
cash provided by operating activities in the united states continues to be our primary source of funds to finance domestic operating needs  capital expenditures  share repurchases and dividend payments to shareowners 
to the extent that such amounts represent previously untaxed earnings  the cash held by foreign subsidiaries would be subject to tax if such amounts were repatriated in the form of dividends  however  not all international cash balances would have to be repatriated in the form of a dividend if returned to the us when amounts earned by foreign subsidiaries are expected to be indefinitely reinvested  no accrual for taxes is provided

future capital spending for anticipated growth and replacement assets will depend on a variety of factors  including economic and industry conditions 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures for will be approximately billion  or approximately of revenue 
capital spending on aircraft over the to period was largely due to scheduled deliveries of previous orders for the boeing erf and f aircraft 
capital spending on vehicles increased during the to period in our us and international package businesses and our freight unit  due to vehicle replacements  technology enhancements and new vehicle orders to support volume growth 
capital expenditures on buildings and facilities increased in  due to expansion and new construction projects at facilities in europe and asia  including a million expansion at our european air hub in cologne  germany that began in and will be completed in the proceeds from the disposal of property  plant and equipment were largely due to real estate and aircraft sales during the through period  as well as the proceeds from insurance recoveries in the net decline in finance receivables in the through period is primarily due to customer paydowns and loan sales activity  primarily in our commercial lending  asset based lending and leasing portfolios 
the purchases and sales of marketable securities are largely determined by liquidity needs and the periodic rebalancing of investment types  and will therefore fluctuate from period to period 
the cash paid for business acquisitions in and was largely due to the acquisitions of kiala sa in belgium and pieffe group in italy  respectively 
the cash received from business dispositions in was largely due to the sale of ups logistics technologies  inc other investing activities are impacted by the cash settlement of derivative contracts used in our currency hedging programs  and the timing of aircraft purchase contract deposits on our boeing erf and f aircraft orders

and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cash received from common stock issuances to employees increased primarily due to additional stock option exercises in and the cash outflows in other financing activities are largely due to repurchases of shares from employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations  as well as certain hedging activities on forecasted debt issuances and premiums paid on capped call options for the purchase of ups class b shares 
in conjunction with the senior fixed rate debt offerings in and  we settled several interest rate derivatives that were designated as hedges of these debt offerings  which resulted in cash inflows outflows of and million  respectively 
during  the expiration and settlement of several capped call options for the purchase of ups class b shares resulted in a cash inflow of million in premiums  while the initial premium payments for these options in resulted in a cash outflow of million during that year 
sources of credit we are authorized to borrow up to billion under our us commercial paper program 
we also maintain a european commercial paper program under which we are authorized to borrow up to billion in a variety of currencies 
amounts were outstanding under these programs as of december  the amount of commercial paper outstanding under these programs in is expected to fluctuate 
we maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks 
one of these agreements provides revolving credit facilities of billion  and expires on april  generally  amounts outstanding under this facility bear interest at a periodic fixed rate equal to libor for the applicable interest period and currency denomination  plus an applicable margin 
alternatively  a fluctuating rate of interest equal to citibank s publicly announced base rate  plus an applicable margin  may be used at our discretion 
in each case  the applicable margin for advances bearing interest based on libor is a percentage determined by quotations from markit group ltd 
for our year credit default swap spread  subject to a minimum rate of and a maximum rate of 
the applicable margin for advances bearing interest based on the base rate is below the applicable margin for libor advances but not lower than 
we are also able to request advances under this facility based on competitive bids for the applicable interest rate 
there were no amounts outstanding under this facility as of december  the second agreement provides revolving credit facilities of billion  and expires on april  generally  amounts outstanding under this facility bear interest at a periodic fixed rate equal to libor for the applicable interest period and currency denomination  plus an applicable margin 
alternatively  a fluctuating rate of interest equal to citibank s publicly announced base rate  plus an applicable margin  may be used at our discretion 
in each case  the applicable margin for advances bearing interest based on libor is a percentage determined by quotations from markit group ltd 
for our credit default swap spread  interpolated for a period from the date of determination of such credit default swap spread in connection with a new interest period until the latest maturity date of this facility then in effect but not less than a period of one year 
the applicable margin is subject to certain minimum rates and maximum rates based on our public debt ratings from standard poor s rating service and moody s investors service 
the minimum applicable margin rates range from to  and the maximum applicable margin rates range from to 
the applicable margin for advances bearing interest based on the base rate is below the applicable margin for libor advances but not less than 
we are also able to request advances under this facility based on competitive bids 
there were no amounts outstanding under this facility as of december  our existing debt instruments and credit facilities subject us to certain financial covenants 
as of december  and for all prior periods presented  we have satisfied these financial covenants 
these covenants limit the amount of secured indebtedness that we may incur  and limit the amount of attributable debt in sale leaseback transactions  to of net tangible assets 
as of december   of net tangible assets is equivalent to billion  however  we have no covered sale leaseback transactions or secured indebtedness outstanding 
additionally  we are required to maintain a minimum net worth  as defined  of billion on a quarterly basis 
as of december   our net worth  as defined  was equivalent to billion

the following table summarizes the expected cash outflow to satisfy our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  in millions commitment type after total capital leases operating leases debt principal debt interest purchase commitments pension fundings other liabilities total our capital lease obligations relate primarily to leases on aircraft 
capital leases  operating leases  and purchase commitments  as well as our debt principal obligations  are discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the amount of interest on our debt was calculated as the contractual interest payments due on our fixed rate debt  in addition to interest on variable rate debt that was calculated based on interest rates as of december  the calculations of debt interest take into account the effect of interest rate swap agreements 
for debt denominated in a foreign currency  the us dollar equivalent principal amount of the debt at the end of the year was used as the basis to calculate future interest payments 
purchase commitments represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding  the largest of which are orders for aircraft  engines  and parts 
as of december   we have firm commitments to purchase eight boeing erf aircraft to be delivered in pension fundings represent the anticipated required cash contributions that will be made to our qualified us pension plans these plans are discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the pension funding requirements were estimated under the provisions of the pension protection act of and the employee retirement income security act of  using discount rates  asset returns and other assumptions appropriate for these plans 
in july  federal legislation was signed into law that allows pension plan sponsors to use higher interest rate assumptions based on a year rate history in valuing plan liabilities and determining funding obligations 
as a result of this legislation  we are not subject to required contributions in and for our domestic pension plans 
the amount of any minimum funding requirement  as applicable  for these plans could change significantly in future periods  depending on many factors  including future plan asset returns and discount rates 
a sustained significant decline in the world equity markets  and the resulting impact on our pension assets and investment returns  could result in our domestic pension plans being subject to significantly higher minimum funding requirements 
to the extent that the funded status of these plans in future years differs from our current projections  the actual contributions made in future years could materially differ from the amounts shown in the table above 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we are not currently subject to any minimum contributions or surcharges with respect to the multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans in which we participate 
contribution rates to these multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans are established through the collective bargaining process 
as we are not subject to any minimum contribution levels  we have not included any amounts in the contractual commitments table with respect to these multiemployer plans 
the contractual payments due for other liabilities primarily include commitment payments related to our investment in certain partnerships 
the table above does not include approximately million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions because we are uncertain if or when such amounts will ultimately be settled in cash 
in addition  we also have recognized assets associated with uncertain tax positions in excess of the related liabilities such that we do not believe a net contractual obligation exists to the taxing authorities 
uncertain tax positions are further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements

collective bargaining agreements as of december   we had approximately  employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the international brotherhood of teamsters teamsters 
these agreements run through july  we have approximately  pilots who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the independent pilots association ipa  which became amendable at the end of our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with teamsters local  which runs through november  in addition  approximately  of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers iam 
our agreement with the iam runs through july  multiemployer benefit plans we contribute to a number of multiemployer defined benefit and health and welfare plans under terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover our union represented employees 
our current collective bargaining agreements set forth the annual contribution increases allotted to the plans that we participate in  and we are in compliance with these contribution rates 
these limitations will remain in effect throughout the terms of the existing collective bargaining agreements 
in the third quarter of  we reached an agreement with the new england pension fund  a multiemployer pension plan in which ups is a participant  to restructure the pension liabilities for approximately  ups employees represented by the teamsters 
the agreement reflects a decision by the new england pension fund trustees to restructure the fund through plan amendments to utilize a two pool approach  which effectively subdivides the plan assets and liabilities between two groups of beneficiaries 
as part of this agreement  ups agreed to withdraw from the original pool of the new england pension fund of which it had historically been a participant  and reenter the new england pension fund newly established pool as a new employer 

table of contents united parcel service  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations upon ratification of the agreement by the teamsters in september  we withdrew from the original pool of the new england pension fund and incurred an undiscounted withdrawal liability of billion to be paid in equal monthly installments over years 
the undiscounted withdrawal liability was calculated by independent actuaries employed by the new england pension fund  in accordance with the governing plan documents and the applicable requirements of the employee retirement income security act of in the third quarter of  we recorded a charge to expense to establish an million withdrawal liability on our balance sheet  which represents the present value of the billion future payment obligation discounted at a interest rate 
this discount rate represents the estimated credit adjusted market rate of interest at which we could obtain financing of a similar maturity and seniority 
as part of this agreement  we believe that ups  the new england pension fund and our affected employees have obtained several benefits  including the old pool of the new england pension fund has historically had  and would likely continue to have  funding challenges  this represented a risk to ups of having to face higher future contribution requirements  as well as a risk to the security of the pension benefits of those ups employees who participate in the new england pension fund 
the year fixed payment obligation should improve the funded status of the new england pension fund over time  while reducing the risk to ups of significantly higher future contribution requirements 
the newly established pool provides better protections for new participating employers 
this pool uses a direct attribution methodology for calculating any potential future withdrawal liabilities  which reduces our exposure to the liabilities of other participating employers 
additionally  this pool contains provisions designed to maintain a fully funded status  including automatic benefit reductions and or increased employee contributions in the event of an underfunded situation occurring 
as part of the agreement  we were able to freeze our hourly pension contribution rate to the newly established pool of the new england pension fund for a period of years  which provides cash flow visibility for both ups and the new england pension fund 
the million charge to expense recorded in the third quarter of is included in compensation and benefits expense in the consolidated statement of income  while the corresponding withdrawal liability is included in other non current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
we will impute interest on the withdrawal liability using the discount rate  while the monthly payments made to the new england pension fund will reduce the remaining balance of the withdrawal liability 
our status in the newly established pool of the new england pension fund is accounted for as the participation in a new multiemployer pension plan  and therefore we will recognize expense based on the contractually required contribution for each period  and we will recognize a liability for any contributions due and unpaid at the end of a reporting period 
rate adjustments in june  our ups freight unit announced a general rate increase averaging  covering non contractual shipments in the united states  canada and mexico 
the rate adjustment took effect on july   and applies to minimum charge  ltl rates and accessorial charges 
in november  we announced an increase in base rates and changes in our fuel surcharge for package shipments that took effect december   including the following ups ground service rates increased an average net through a combination of a increase in rates and a reduction in the index used to determine the ground fuel surcharge 
ups next day air  ups nd day air  ups day select  and international air shipments originating in the united states including worldwide express  worldwide express plus  ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service increased an average net  through a combination of a increase in base rates and a reduction in the index used to determine the air fuel surcharge

new accounting pronouncements recently adopted accounting standards in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standards update to disclosure requirements for fair value measurement 
these amendments  which became effective for us in the first quarter of  result in a common definition of fair value and common measurement and disclosure requirements between us gaap and ifrs 
consequently  the amendments change some fair value measurement principles and disclosure requirements 
the implementation of this amended accounting guidance had an immaterial impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued an accounting standards update that increases the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income in the financial statements 
this update requires companies to present comprehensive income in a single statement below net income or in a separate statement of comprehensive income immediately following the income statement 
this requirement became effective for us beginning with the first quarter of  and we have included the required presentation in all applicable filings since that date 
in july  the fasb issued an accounting standards update that added an optional qualitative assessment for determining whether an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
the objective of this update is to reduce the cost and complexity of performing an impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets by allowing an entity the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of an intangible impairment to determine whether it should calculate the fair value of the asset 
this accounting standards update also amends existing guidance by expanding upon the examples of events and circumstances that an entity should consider between annual impairment tests in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount 
we adopted this accounting standard update and applied its provisions to certain of our intangible assets for our annual impairment testing as of october  other accounting pronouncements adopted during the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements had an immaterial impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
accounting standards issued but not yet effective in february  the fasb issued an accounting standards update that adds new disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
this update requires that companies present either in a single note or parenthetically on the face of the financial statements  the effect of significant amounts reclassified from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income based on its source eg  the release due to cash flow hedges from interest rate contracts and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification eg  interest income or interest expense 
if a component is not required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety eg  the net periodic pension cost  companies would instead cross reference to the related footnote for additional information eg  the pension footnote 
this update is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of other accounting pronouncements issued  but not effective until after december   are not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as indicated in note to our consolidated financial statements  the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles 
we base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances 
actual results could differ from our estimates  which would affect the related amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
while estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts  we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
contingencies as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies 
we record a liability based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency 
the actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates 
if a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate  a future charge to income would result 
likewise  if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate  a future credit to income would result 
the events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable 
at the time a contingency is identified  we consider all relevant facts as part of our evaluation 
we record a liability for a loss when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable 
events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability 
these factors could result in a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 
contingent losses that are probable and estimable  excluding those related to income taxes and self insurance which are discussed further below  were not material to our financial position or results of operations as of  and for the year ended  december  in addition  we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of december   because a loss is not reasonably estimable 
goodwill and intangible impairment we perform impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting units on an annual basis 
our reporting units are comprised of the europe  asia  and americas reporting units in the international package reporting segment  and the forwarding  logistics  ups freight  mbe the ups store and ups capital reporting units in the supply chain freight reporting segment 
our annual goodwill impairment testing date is october st for each reporting unit 
in assessing goodwill for impairment  we initially evaluate qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive and it is necessary to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit  then we utilize a two step process to test goodwill for impairment 
first  a comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying value  including goodwill  is performed 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss 
the second step includes comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
we primarily determine the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model dcf model  and supplement this with observable valuation multiples for comparable companies  as applicable 
the completion of the dcf model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows 
these assumptions include projections of future revenue  costs and working capital changes 
in addition  we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variables  as required  in estimating the fair value of our reporting units 
the projections that we use in our dcf model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units 
the determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in these assumptions  and changes in our business strategy  government regulations or economic or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments 
we will continue to monitor market conditions and other factors to determine if interim impairment tests are necessary in future periods 
if impairment indicators are present in future periods  the resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations 

table of contents united parcel service  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations none of the reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in  or changes in our forecasts could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods  potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge 
a decrease in the estimated fair value of our reporting units as of our most recent goodwill testing date october  would not result in a goodwill impairment charge 
licenses with a carrying value of million as of december  are deemed to be indefinite lived intangibles  and therefore are not amortized 
impairment tests for indefinite lived intangibles are performed on an annual basis 
all of our remaining recorded intangible assets are deemed to be finite lived intangibles  and are thus amortized over their estimated useful lives 
impairment tests for these intangible assets are only performed when a triggering event occurs that indicates that the carrying value of the intangible may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the intangible 
if the carrying amount of the intangible is determined not to be recoverable  a write down to fair value is recorded 
fair values are determined based on a dcf model 
no impairments of indefinite lived or finite lived intangible assets were recognized in  or self insurance accruals we self insure costs associated with workers compensation claims  automotive liability  health and welfare and general business liabilities  up to certain limits 
insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims  as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
recorded balances are based on reserve levels  which incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim 
trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves 
we believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate  but actual experience in claim frequency and or severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations 
workers compensation  automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle 
consequently  actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claims 
a number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim  including the length of time the claim remains open  trends in health care costs and the results of related litigation 
furthermore  claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections 
changes in state legislation with respect to workers compensation can affect the adequacy of our self insurance accruals 
all of these factors can result in revisions to prior actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 
we sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees 
these liabilities and related expenses are based on estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans  anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation 
actual results may differ from these estimates and  therefore  produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results 
fair value measurements in the normal course of business  we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk  including derivatives  marketable securities  finance receivables  other investments and debt 
certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value  principally derivatives  marketable securities  pension assets and certain other investments 
fair values are based on listed market prices  when such prices are available 
to the extent that listed market prices are not available  fair value is determined based on other relevant factors  including dealer price quotations 
certain financial instruments  including over the counter derivative instruments  are valued using pricing models that consider  among other factors  contractual and market prices  correlations  time value  credit spreads and yield curve volatility factors 
changes in the fixed income  equity  foreign exchange and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future  potentially affecting our results of operations 
a quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and equity prices is presented in the market risk section of this report

and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations pension and postretirement medical benefits our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  inflation  compensation increase rates  expected returns on plan assets  mortality rates and other factors 
the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans represent our best estimates  and we believe that they are reasonable  based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other factors that might cause future expectations to differ from past trends 
differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 
the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses each year are changes in the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of the measurement date and differences between the expected and the actual return on plan assets 
we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of a corridor defined as of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligations in pension expense annually at december st each year 
the remaining components of pension expense  primarily service and interest costs and the expected return on plan assets  are recorded on a quarterly basis 
the following sensitivity analysis shows the impact of a basis point change in the assumed discount rate  expected return on assets  and health care cost trend rate for our pension and postretirement benefit plans  and the resulting increase decrease on our obligations and expense excluding the impact of actuarial gains and losses recognized outside of the corridor as of  and for the year ended  december  in millions 
basis point increase basis point decrease pension plans discount rate effect on ongoing net periodic benefit cost effect on projected benefit obligation return on assets effect on ongoing net periodic benefit cost postretirement medical plans discount rate effect on ongoing net periodic benefit cost effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation health care cost trend rate effect on ongoing net periodic benefit cost effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation expense is expected to increase in compared with  due primarily to the decline in the discount rate used to determine expense from for to for this is partially offset by the contributions to the plans in  that increased the expected return on assets used for expense calculation purposes 
depreciation  residual value and impairment of fixed assets as of december   we had billion of net fixed assets  the most significant category of which is aircraft 
in accounting for fixed assets  we make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets  and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets 

table of contents united parcel service  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft  we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types 
subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program  changes in the utilization of the aircraft  governmental regulations on aging aircraft and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types 
we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions  and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary 
adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense 
we review long lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset 
if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable  a write down to fair value is recorded 
fair values are determined based on quoted market values  discounted cash flows or external appraisals  as applicable 
we review long lived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified 
the circumstances that would indicate potential impairment may include  but are not limited to  a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset 
in estimating cash flows  we project future volume levels for our different air express products in all geographic regions in which we do business 
adverse changes in these volume forecasts  or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projections  could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand 
this situation would lead to an excess of a particular aircraft type  resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or a reduction of the expected life of an aircraft type thus resulting in increased depreciation expense 
in  and  there were no indicators of impairment in our property  plant and equipment  and no impairment charges were recorded in any period 
income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction  tax credits  benefits  and deductions  and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as the interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax positions 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
we believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
however  should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
once it is determined that the position meets the recognition threshold  the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision

and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations allowance for doubtful accounts losses on accounts receivable are recognized when they are incurred  which requires us to make our best estimate of the probable losses inherent in our customer receivables at each balance sheet date 
these estimates require consideration of historical loss experience adjusted for current conditions  trends in customer payment frequency  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions and the financial health of specific customers and market sectors 
our risk management process includes standards and policies for reviewing major account exposures and concentrations of risk 
deterioration in macroeconomic variables could result in our ultimate loss exposures on our accounts receivable being significantly higher than what we have currently estimated and reserved for in our allowance for doubtful accounts 
our total allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  and was and million  respectively 
our total provision for doubtful accounts charged to expense during the years ended december   and was  and million  respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and equity prices 
all of these market risks arise in the normal course of business  as we do not engage in speculative trading activities 
in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures  we utilize a variety of commodity  foreign exchange and interest rate forward contracts  options and swaps 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
commodity price risk we are exposed to changes in the prices of refined fuels  principally jet a  diesel and unleaded gasoline  as well as changes in the price of natural gas 
currently  the fuel surcharges that we apply to our domestic and international package and ltl services are the primary means of reducing the risk of adverse fuel price changes 
additionally  we periodically use a combination of option contracts to provide partial protection from changing fuel and energy prices 
as of december  and  however  we had no commodity option contracts outstanding 
foreign currency exchange risk we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue  operating expenses and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate 
we are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities and cash flows 
our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro  the british pound sterling  canadian dollar  chinese renminbi and hong kong dollar 
we use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge forecasted cash flow currency exposures 
these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods of to months 
additionally  we utilize cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the currency risk inherent in the interest and principal payments associated with foreign currency denominated debt obligations 
the terms of these swap agreements are commensurate with the underlying debt obligations 
interest rate risk we have issued debt instruments  including debt associated with capital leases  that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest 
we use a combination of interest rate swaps as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing 
the notional amount  interest payment and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt 
we also utilize forward starting swaps and similar instruments to lock in all or a portion of the borrowing cost of anticipated debt issuances 
our floating rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in short term primarily libor interest rates 
we also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations  as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans  which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods 
we have investments in debt securities  as well as cash equivalent instruments  some of which accrue income at variable rates of interest 
additionally  we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest

and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations equity price risk we hold investments in various common equity securities that are subject to price risk 
these securities are primarily in the form of equity index funds 
sensitivity analysis the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk  foreign currency exchange risk  interest rate risk and equity price risk embedded in our existing financial instruments 
we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in exchange rates  interest rate yield curves and commodity and equity prices 
for options and instruments with non linear returns  models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented  primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously 
in addition  the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
while this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios  these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts 
we adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions 
additionally  changes in the fair value of foreign currency derivatives and commodity derivatives are offset by changes in the cash flows of the underlying hedged foreign currency and commodity transactions 
shock test result as of december  in millions change in fair value currency derivatives change in annual expense variable rate debt interest rate derivatives the potential change in fair value from a hypothetical weakening of the us dollar against local currency exchange rates across all maturities 
the potential change in annual interest expense resulting from a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates  applied to our variable rate debt and swap instruments excluding hedges of anticipated debt issuances 
the sensitivity of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations to changes in interest rates is quantified in critical accounting policies and estimates 
the sensitivity in the fair value and interest income of our marketable securities due to changes in equity prices and interest rates  respectively  was not material as of december  and the sensitivity in the fair value and interest income of our finance receivables due to changes in interest rates was also not material as of december  and
