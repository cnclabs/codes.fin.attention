item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements based on our current assumptions  expectations  estimates and projections about our business and the homebuilding industry  and therefore  it should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto  as well as cautionary note regarding forward looking statements discussed elsewhere within this annual report on form k 
for a listing of potential risks and uncertainties which impact our business and industry  see item a  risk factors 
actual results could differ from our expectations due to several factors which include  but are not limited to market price and demand for our products  economic and competitive conditions  capital expenditures  new technology  regulatory changes and other uncertainties 
unless otherwise required by law  we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
our business we are a technological leader in the home building products market  and we operate in two segments engineered products and aluminum sheet products 
the engineered products segment manufactures systems  finished products  and components serving the original equipment manufacturer oem residential window and door industry  while the aluminum sheet products segment produces mill finished and coated aluminum sheet serving the broader residential building products and transportation markets 
we serve a primary customer base in north america  and also serve customers in international markets through our operating plants in the united kingdom and germany  as well as through sales and marketing efforts in other countries 
we have four operating divisions which comprise the engineered products business segment  and one operating division which comprises the aluminum sheet products business segment 
other costs  including corporate office expense  certain shared administrative functions  last in first out lifo inventory valuation adjustments and inter segment eliminations are categorized as corporate other costs 
the accounting policies of our business segments are the same as those used to prepare our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
for each of our two business segments  we believe the primary drivers of our operating results are residential remodeling and replacement r r activity and new home construction 
we believe that housing starts and window shipments are indicators of activity levels in the home building industry  and we use this data  as published by or derived from third party sources  to evaluate the market 
in general  the rate of housing starts has increased over the past two years after a dramatic decline from through resulting from a general recession and a mortgage crisis in the united states 
the recovery in the housing market has been relatively slow and growth in new home construction in the united states has been led by multi family homes for which window to floor ratios are lower compared to mid and higher priced homes 
the current growth in single family homes has seen the share of the large track builders increase and the smaller custom builders decrease 
multi family and track homes typically employ lower cost  less energy efficient building materials than the vinyl window profiles and insulating glass spacers that we manufacture 
due to these circumstances  a greater portion of our business has shifted to the r r market  which has experienced slower growth than the new construction market 
the trailing month window shipment results for the year ended october  derived from published reports by ducker worldwide  a consulting and research firm  indicates that volume has increased by only for r r window shipments on a year over year basis  compared to for new construction  resulting in a combined window shipment growth rate of 
our aluminum sheet products business segment is a commodity driven business that depends to a large extent on fluctuations in aluminum prices on the london metals exchange lme  as well as fluctuations in the premium paid to ship product to and from our casting plant in davenport  iowa 
the price of aluminum impacts our cost of raw material as well as the price we can demand for our products 
historically  aluminum prices have fluctuated due to various macro economic factors which impact global supply and demand 
lme prices have experienced a general decline in recent years 
our business is impacted by seasonality 
we historically experience lower sales during the first half of our fiscal year as winter weather reduces homebuilding and home improvement activity 
market overview and outlook despite record highs in the united states stock market in  the general united states economy has experienced slower than expected growth  although the housing industry has begun to rebound more quickly 
new home construction and the level of r r activities grew throughout and are expected to continue to grow into although this growth is encouraging  the number of housing starts fluctuates between months  and r r growth continues to lag the rate of recovery in new home construction 
the national association of home builders nahb currently predicts that annual housing starts in the united states will rise to million over the next two years 
according to the united states census bureau and nahb data  the number of actual housing starts has increased approximately based on published data available when comparing our fiscal to 
table of contents the same period in we believe that the housing recovery is well underway in the united states but that there are challenges to near term growth prospects of the fenestration and aluminum markets that we serve 
according to a recent study published by ducker worldwide  multi family homes have steadily increased as a percentage of total new housing starts and are expected to reach a peak level of this year 
market data such as the leading indicator of remodeling activity lira and the nahb remodeling market index rmi suggest that remodeling activity will see healthy increases in the subsequent year 
in their november forecast  ducker worldwide indicated that window shipments for the r r markets are expected to increase from million in to million in we continue to believe the pace of remodeling activity will lag new construction by to months  and that remodeling activity will initially be concentrated on spending for lower cost items than window and doors 
therefore  we believe that a sustained increase in the demand for our products will occur later in the recovery  unless there is an unexpected increase in the energy efficient tax credits currently available to homeowners or if there are stricter regulations imposed which require more energy efficient windows 
we could experience pricing pressure due to the entry of new competitors into the market 
as conditions in the housing market improve  new window manufacturers may replace those that were forced out of business in the aftermath of the financial crisis  or one or more of our large customers may decide to vertically integrate and replace our products by developing similar products internally 
increased competition may influence the market and the price we can charge for our products 
due to pockets of excess capacity in the markets we serve  specifically the vinyl window profile market  we have observed evidence of price cutting by our competitors and we expect there will continue to be pricing pressure in the near term 
we believe the key to maintaining our status as a market leader will be to take a disciplined approach to the way we seek new business opportunities and focus on providing superior value to our customers 
outside of the united states  we continue to be optimistic about our growth prospects in europe  particularly in the united kingdom  germany and scandinavian countries  where the push for higher energy efficiency standards has been the greatest 
based on our internal analysis  we estimate the size of the insulating glass spacer markets in continental europe and the united kingdom to be approximately billion feet  nearly double the size of the north american market 
moreover  older technology cold edge spacers are still a dominant force in these regions and garner almost of the total market share  compared to a significantly lower percentage in the united states 
we currently operate plants in the united kingdom and in germany  where we recently added a third production line 
we believe the investments we are currently making will enable us to become the provider of choice as demand for more energy efficient warm edge spacers grows and eventually displaces cold edge spacers 
recovery in the united states housing market should promote demand for aluminum and support favorable lme prices  but other factors  such as growth rates and supply overhang in china  the stabilization of the european economies and fiscal challenges in the united states could continue to depress commodity prices 
the volatility that has characterized commodity markets during the five years following the onset of the financial crisis may continue  and the profitability of our aluminum products business will fluctuate accordingly 
although the price of the scrap material we purchase is dependent to a certain extent on lme prices  the sales price of our finished goods is generally more impacted by short term changes in lme pricing 
therefore  in periods of declining lme prices  we tend to suffer from both lower revenues and proportionately higher raw material costs 
despite initial forecasts of rising aluminum prices during  the average price for the full year was fairly stagnant relative to recent changes in rules regarding lme warehousing may cause a short term change in overall aluminum supply in the united states  which could impact pricing 
however  we do not expect the average price of aluminum to vary significantly from fiscal to fiscal recent transactions and events in august  our board of directors approved a plan to cease all activities associated with our enterprise resource planning erp implementation based on several elements  but the primary element was the opportunity to spend the resources on a number of organic growth opportunities that are available to us today which were not available when the implementation effort began in these opportunities will require capital but offer significantly higher returns on invested capital than a continued investment in the erp system 
in conjunction with our efforts to cease the erp implementation  we have migrated several operating units which were utilizing the erp prior to august back to legacy systems as of october   although we will continue to use certain elements of the erp at the corporate office 
we expensed million of amounts which were recorded in construction in progress 
in addition  we recorded a change in accounting estimate during the fourth quarter of and have accelerated depreciation associated with certain erp assets resulting in additional depreciation expense of million through october  we expect to recognize an additional million of depreciation expense associated with this change in estimate in fiscal certain erp functions associated with the corporate office are expected to continue to be used beyond the short term and will continue to depreciate over the original useful lives of the assets 
we incurred certain charges related to one time termination benefits and contract termination costs which were not deemed significant and were expensed as incurred 

table of contents our former chairman  president and chief executive officer  mr 
david petratis  retired from his position effective july  mr 
petratis participated in a number of our stock based and deferred compensation plans 
as a result of the forfeiture of certain awards in conjunction with the retirement  we recorded a benefit of approximately million during in addition  we expect to pay approximately million to mr 
petratis within one year  which represents his vested balances under certain deferred compensation plans 
in december  we acquired substantially all of the assets of alumco inc and its subsidiaries alumco for million  which included a working capital adjustment received of million  and subject to an earn out provision for which we accrued a liability of million as part of the purchase price allocation 
as of october   we determined that the earn out provision criteria would not be met and decreased expense by million 
the purchase of alumco allowed us to expand the scope of our fenestration business to include screens for vinyl window and door manufacturers  and to expand our geographic reach throughout the united states 
we believe this acquisition will allow us to build upon our national and regional oem customer base and enhance our distribution capabilities 
we recorded goodwill of million in conjunction with this transaction which was included entirely within the engineered products business segment 
we are currently managing this business as a separate division within the engineered products segment 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the union employees at our casting and finishing plants associated with the aluminum products business went on strike 
while this matter was being negotiated  our ability to provide product to our customers was impacted and our shipments declined by approximately million pounds 
in addition  we incurred higher material costs to purchase goods from third party sources in order to meet our customers supply needs 
the strike ended in early and our relationship with the union has remained satisfactory since 
our results for fiscal were negatively impacted as a result of the strike 
we did not incur similar costs in in november  we committed to a plan to consolidate two insulating glass facilities to obtain efficiencies following an acquisition in march the consolidation plan  in part  resulted in the closure of a plant in barbourville  kentucky  and the relocation of equipment that was used to manufacture the single seal  warm edge spacer system to our facility in cambridge  ohio 
the facility in barbourville is currently being held for sale 
the consolidation was substantially completed by august  with minor residual cash payments and program costs incurred during fiscal we have realized consolidation savings in compared to  primarily related to labor costs 
in addition  costs incurred in conjunction with the consolidation in fiscal did not recur in comparison of the fiscal years ended october  and consolidated results of operations this table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the twelve month periods ended october  and a general explanation of changes in net sales and operating income follow  with a more detailed explanation included in the analysis of the business segments 
for the years ended october  vs 
amounts of sales amounts of sales change change dollars in millions net sales cost of sales selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization asset impairment charges operating income loss interest expense other  net income tax benefit expense income loss from continuing operations the improvement in our consolidated net sales for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  was driven primarily by an increase in shipments of for our aluminum sheet products segment 
within our engineered products segment  net sales were higher due to the contribution from the alumco business acquired in december  which provided net sales of million for the period from the acquisition date through october  the engineered products segment has also experienced organic growth related to our vinyl window profile business  increased sales for our 
table of contents insulating glass business driven by growth in europe and an increase in demand for our engineered component business in fiscal our operating results improved by million in fiscal compared to fiscal we experienced growth in sales for each business segment  coupled with cost efficiencies realized in the current year  partially offset by higher material and labor costs and higher corporate expenses 
within the aluminum sheet products business segment  our operating losses decreased by million  as production returned to more normalized levels in following the labor strike in the strike was resolved in mid  but the impact was an increase in material  labor  conversion and administrative costs which adversely affected our results for fiscal however  our aluminum business continues to be challenged by volatile lme prices and higher raw material scrap prices 
operating income within the engineered products business segment increased by million during fiscal compared to fiscal operating income for was negatively affected by facility consolidation expenses that did not recur in the current year 
in addition  the consolidation produced labor savings in corporate expenses increased during fiscal primarily due to our erp system implementation efforts and other corporate initiatives  such as information technology 
interest expense increased slightly in fiscal compared to fiscal due to borrowings under our senior unsecured credit facility 
no borrowings were outstanding at october  other  net typically includes interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and net foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
other  net was million for the years ended october  and our annual effective tax rates for the years ended october  and were and  respectively 
the effective tax rates were relatively consistent between years  with the variance associated with  permanent differences  foreign tax rate differential and state tax rate differentials 
in addition  the results were impacted by certain nondeductible employee related items 
engineered products for the years ended october  change change dollars in millions net sales cost of sales selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization asset impairment charges operating income operating income margin the increase in net sales for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to the following the acquisition of alumco on december   which contributed net sales of million during the period in  an increase in demand for our insulating glass warm edge spacers in europe  particularly in central europe  eastern europe and scandinavia  and to a lesser extent  in the united states  higher sales of vinyl window and door profiles  as favorable increases in demand resulted in a higher volume of units shipped  partially offset by the effect of pricing pressure and a decrease in pass through surcharges for resin  and higher sales for our engineered components products  due largely to higher demand from a national customer 
in connection with our european operations  we expanded our plant in germany to a third production line which became operational in we expect demand for our warm edge spacers to remain high in europe  but to be more challenged in north america  as sales of our higher end spacer products continue to be negatively affected by the housing downturn in canada and the recent shift in new construction to multi family dwellings in the united states 
our cost of sales increased by million  or  when comparing fiscal to fiscal this increase was slightly higher than the increase in net sales for the respective period 
of this increase in cost of sales  million was related to the alumco acquisition 
in addition  we have experienced pricing pressure  as well as higher material and labor costs 
the profitability of our vinyl products continues to be challenged as we have provided volume discounts for our fastest growing customers and experienced an increase in the cost of resin  which is the primary raw material used to manufacture our vinyl profiles 
as sales to certain customers increase  we are obligated to provide greater price concessions in the form of volume discounts  which ultimately reduce our profit margins 
we were able to pass some of the higher resin costs on to our customers through price adjustments  but we did absorb a greater proportion of this expense during recent months  as reflected in the decline in overall profit margin year over year 
as our business grows and throughput increases  we must retain quality workers by providing higher wages  more overtime pay and supplemental indirect labor 
to offset these cost increases  we are focused on improving our 
table of contents operational and production efficiencies to lower overall manufacturing overhead costs  although we remain challenged in certain areas  including managing our scrap costs 
an increase in material costs has adversely affected our current year gross margins 
we completed a plan to consolidate our insulating glass spacer facilities in north america in august partially offsetting our increase in cost of sales was consolidation savings in fiscal totaling million 
our selling  general and administrative costs decreased by million  or  when comparing fiscal and fiscal during fiscal  we incurred million of insulating glass consolidation related expenses that did not recur during the current period 
in addition  we estimate annual pre tax savings as a result of this consolidation of million 
these decreases in selling  general and administration expense were partially offset by the expense associated with alumco  which contributed million during fiscal depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  when comparing fiscal to fiscal of this amount  million was related to certain intangible assets and fixed assets we acquired with the alumco purchase transaction 
in addition  we have invested approximately million for capital improvements during the twelve months ended october   which has resulted in additional depreciation expense compared to fiscal we recorded an impairment loss of million during fiscal of this amount  million was related to a write down of certain land held for sale in arizona  and million was related to a write down of the facility held for sale in barbourville  kentucky  as well as certain other fixed assets of our insulating glass business 
for fiscal  we recorded an impairment loss of million associated with our facility in barbourville  kentucky 
aluminum sheet products for the years ended october  change change dollars in millions net sales cost of sales selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization operating loss income operating loss income margin shipped pounds in millions net sales for our aluminum sheet products business segment increased by million  or in fiscal compared to fiscal the primary driver of this increase in sales was an increase in the volume of pounds shipped of during this period 
the benefit received from the volume increase was partially offset by lower aluminum prices  evidenced by lower than expected lme pricing 
based on published reports  lme aluminum pricing per pound decreased during fiscal compared to fiscal furthermore  we have experienced a continued shift in our business from value added painted sheet to mill finished products  which command a lower sales price and less favorable profit margins 
we resolved a labor strike during the second quarter of which we estimate reduced our shipments by approximately million pounds in fiscal cost of sales increased by in fiscal compared to fiscal the changes in cost of sales were consistent with the percent changes in net sales for these periods  except margins were more favorable in as a result of the strike that occurred during  we incurred higher third party processing labor and material costs as we purchased semi finished coil from outside parties to fulfill customer orders  as we did not have the labor necessary to run our casting facility at full capacity 
in  we did not incur these outside service costs 
however  our operations were unfavorably impacted by the volatility of aluminum commodity prices 
we continue to focus on operating efficiencies to improve our margins 
we emphasize quality service to our customers and preventive maintenance to yield positive results for our aluminum sheet products business segment 
we invested heavily in repair and maintenance costs in fiscal  which contributed to a decline in repair in maintenance costs in fiscal of million 
in addition  our energy costs declined in fiscal by million  partially due to intermittent power outages at our casting and finishing plants  which resulted in slowed production and some rework of our aluminum sheet products 
the installation of the new paint oven at our finishing facility in alabama was completed in at a total cost of million and has been returned to operation 
we believe this capital expenditure will be essential to improving the quality of our painted sheet product and better position us to compete in the market 
as long as lme prices continue to hover at historical lows  improvement in the profitability of our aluminum sheet products segment will depend in part on painted sheet becoming a greater share of our total shipments 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expense decreased by million  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was attributable to a decline in outside service costs  some of which was labor strike related in  and lower other professional service costs  partially offset by higher health insurance costs and other employee related expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased by million  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was associated with the acceleration of the remaining useful lives of several assets that were taken out of service during for the twelve months ended october   we have invested million in equipment for the aluminum sheet products business segment 
the increase in depreciation expense associated with these new assets was partially offset by assets that became fully depreciated during the year and were retired 
corporate other for the years ended october  change change dollars in millions net sales cost of sales selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization operating income net sales for corporate other consist of the elimination of inter segment sales from the aluminum sheet products business segment to the engineered products business segment  and cost of sales includes an offsetting elimination  as well as any other eliminations 
in addition  for the year ended october  and  we recorded a benefit of million and million  respectively  for our lifo accrual adjustments 
the change in the lifo reserve during fiscal year was due primarily to a decrease in inventory levels for our aluminum sheet product business segment 
in fiscal year  the change related primarily to a decrease in aluminum pricing levels 
in  we adopted an implementation plan with regards to a new enterprise resource planning software 
we began the implementation pursuant to this plan  and we incurred costs  of which a portion was expensed and a portion was capitalized as a fixed asset 
in connection with this implementation  the amounts expensed as selling  general and administrative expense during the years ended october  and was million and million  respectively 
the initial phase of the erp implementation was effective march  and we capitalized an asset totaling approximately million 
we continued to incur costs associated with this initial phase during the succeeding months after the asset was capitalized  all of which was expensed as incurred in accordance with us gaap 
in addition  we began incurring costs pursuant to the next phase of the erp implementation  a portion of which was expensed and a portion capitalized 
concurrently  we incurred incremental costs related to additional personnel and consultants to support the implementation effort 
these costs were the primary contributors to the increase in selling  general and administrative expense at corporate for fiscal compared to fiscal we also recorded million of incremental costs related to our self insured worker compensation program  higher costs associated with stock based compensation expense on a year over year basis  partially offset by the benefit associated with other forfeited awards under our compensation plans for which the value is based on our common stock price  higher employee training costs  and transaction costs of million incurred in early associated with the alumco acquisition 
these increases were partially offset by lower incentive accruals based on earnings 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense of million for fiscal compared to fiscal  was primarily related to accelerated depreciation associated with our erp system 
in august  our board of directors approved a plan to cease all activities associated with our erp implementation 
effective october   we transitioned our manufacturing operations that were using the erp system to legacy systems 
we expensed million of construction in progress in august in addition  we incurred one time termination benefits and minimal contract termination costs during the fourth quarter of we accelerated depreciation for the first phase of this erp implementation which resulted in incremental depreciation expense of million 
in addition  in april  we capitalized an office build out associated with the new corporate offices in houston  texas 

table of contents comparison of the fiscal years ended october  and consolidated results of operations this table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the twelve month periods ended october  and a general explanation of changes in net sales and operating income follow  with a more detailed explanation included in the analysis of the business segments 
for the years ended october  vs 
amounts of sales amounts of sales change change dollars in millions net sales cost of sales selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization asset impairment charges operating income loss interest expense other  net income tax benefit expense income loss from continuing operations the decline in net sales for fiscal compared to the fiscal was driven by reduced aluminum shipments and lower aluminum prices within the aluminum sheet products segment as net sales declined by million during fiscal compared to fiscal the segment experienced a strike at two of its facilities in davenport  iowa  during fiscal which had a significant negative impact on shipments 
operating income declined for fiscal by million  compared to fiscal  with the majority of the decrease at the aluminum sheet products segment 
fiscal was negatively impacted by the strike which resulted in direct strike related losses coupled with additional strike related inefficiencies  lower aluminum shipments and lower aluminum prices 
additionally  we incurred costs associated with the consolidation of two insulating glass plants totaling million  and an incremental increase of million in costs associated with our erp implementation effort at corporate 
interest expense for the years ended october  and was consistent at million 
no amounts were borrowed under our revolving credit facility during fiscal years and other  net typically includes interest income earned on excess cash and cash equivalents  as well as foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to our foreign insulating glass businesses 
for the year ended october   other  net represented a gain of million compared to a loss of million in fiscal the change was primarily due to a decline in net foreign currency transaction losses of million associated with foreign currency denominated receivables in fiscal our effective tax rate for the years ended october  and was and  respectively 
we recorded a pre tax loss for and the overall decrease in the effective tax rate between periods reduced our tax benefit and was largely attributable to a state valuation allowance and nondeductible employee related items in fiscal 
table of contents engineered products for the years ended october  change change dollars in millions net sales cost of sales selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization asset impairment charges operating income operating income margin net sales increased by million  or  for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  this increase in sales was largely attributable to the acquisition of edgetech on march   which contributed a full twelve months of operating results in compared to only seven months of operating results in  resulting in a year over year increase in net sales of million  an increase in vinyl fenestration extrusion sales  partially attributable to an increase in market share at big box stores by a large customer that uses our products and manufactures mid to high end wood and vinyl windows  and increased demand for our warm edge spacer products in europe due to changing codes and standards 
partially offsetting these improvements was the effect of tax credits in the united states in early fiscal which expired on december   thereby benefiting fiscal but not fiscal the overall increase in organic net sales was approximately a improvement year over year  which exceeded the market performance  if measured based on the published information by ducker worldwide  which indicated that in the united states  the window shipments for r r market were down by and the overall window shipments were up only by for the twelve month period ended in september  while we believe we are competitively strong in our energy efficient product offerings  the higher price points often associated with these higher end products may limit sales volumes in times of tight credit conditions and low consumer confidence 
cost of sales increased by million  or  for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  the increase in cost of sales was consistent with the increase in net sales during the period  with a slight increase in net sales less cost of sales contribution margin for fiscal the favorable increase in contribution margin was partially associated with the edgetech acquisition  which contributed twelve months of operating results in compared to seven months of operating results in  and resulted in a non cash charge of million in associated with higher inventory values  and thus higher material costs  resulting from purchase accounting 
the increase in contribution margin was also attributable to pricing initiatives  cost controls  productivity improvements and favorable warranty experience 
one pricing initiative was the oil based raw material surcharge which was initiated on may  related to certain insulating glass spacer operations 
this surcharge enabled us to offset the higher cost of butyl  a key raw material that is highly correlated to the price of oil 
in addition  we recorded a benefit of million associated with a reduction of our warranty reserve requirements based on favorable experience  compared to a charge to the reserve in of million associated with a discontinued product 
partially offsetting these favorable results was the negative impact of customer mix and an increase in freight costs incurred to ship spacer product overseas to support the increase in international demand 
selling  general and administrative expense increased by million  or for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  of this amount  million was incremental costs associated with the edgetech acquisition  which provided a full twelve months of operating results in compared to seven months of operating activity in in addition  we initiated a consolidation program to close our insulating glass spacer manufacturing facility in barbourville  kentucky and move the operation to our insulating glass spacer manufacturing facility in cambridge  ohio 
the facility consolidation was completed in august we recorded million of consolidation costs in consisting of million for employee related costs and million for plant closure  equipment moving and set up costs 
during fiscal  we incurred million of consolidation costs related to another facility  which was accrued as a lease termination cost after taking into account potential sublease rentals 
in addition  we incurred higher compensation costs associated with annual incentives 
these benefits were partially offset by a net gain of million associated with insurance proceeds received from a property claim 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  this increase was largely due to the edgetech acquisition  which provided incremental depreciation and amortization expense of million in partially offsetting this increase in depreciation and amortization expense was million of accelerated depreciation related to the plant consolidation recognized in the first quarter of we recorded a million impairment charge for the year ended october   of which million is related to the roof collapse of our facility in barbourville  kentucky 
for the year ended october   we recorded a million non 
table of contents cash asset impairment charge related to the real property in barbourville  kentucky  we recorded this charge when we made the decision to sell this facility and to consolidate this facility assets into our operating plant in cambridge  ohio 
our operating income declined in fiscal compared to fiscal as the contributions from the edgetech acquisition  higher vinyl fenestration sales and improved sales of warm edge spacer were offset by the consolidation costs associated with the insulating glass business and start up costs associated with the warm edge spacer business 
aluminum sheet products for the years ended october  change change dollars in millions net sales cost of sales selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization operating loss income operating loss income margin shipped pounds in millions net sales decreased by million  or  for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  due to a decline in volume shipped and decrease in the average selling price of our products in fiscal shipments decreased by million pounds in  which was largely attributable to the strike which occurred during the second quarter of and was directly related to a decline in volume of approximately million pounds  reliability and quality issues  some of which were indirectly related to the strike and the use of outside processors  and the demand for our products was low during the early months of our fiscal year due to the expiration of the government supported window tax credit program during the fiscal year the underperformance of our aluminum products business was also attributable to a relatively weaker demand in the residential sector  where we have a large presence  compared to stronger demand for the distribution and transportation sectors  where we have a smaller presence 
the decrease in the selling price of our products was primarily related to lower lme aluminum prices in the comparative periods 
lme aluminum prices are the most commonly used index for correlating aluminum sheet prices and have averaged around per pound in fiscal compared to about per pound in the fiscal year cost of sales decreased by million  or  for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  as a percentage  cost of sales declined year over year while net sales declined for the same period 
this decrease in cost of sales was largely attributable to lower shipments  a result of the strike that occurred in the second quarter of in addition  we incurred higher employee related costs following the strike 
the decline in activity levels impacted our variable costs  but our fixed costs remained relatively constant 
as a result  our fixed costs represented a greater portion of total costs  so our overall cost of sales did not decline at the same rate as net sales 
further  our material costs were impacted by the volatility of lme aluminum commodity prices  although not to the extent of impact to the selling price of our products 
we also incurred higher repair and maintenance costs for fiscal compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative costs increased by million  or  for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  of this increase  million was directly related to the strike  including costs for negotiating activities  legal fees and security 
the strike began on january   and included approximately employees at two of our facilities located in davenport  iowa 
during the strike  we offered permanent positions to temporary workers  the majority of which were accepted 
shortly after  the union ended the strike 
a new five year agreement was eventually ratified in september in addition to the direct expenses associated with the strike  we incurred additional expense during the period between when the strike ended and when the new agreement was ratified due to inefficiencies and employee related costs 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased by million  or  for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  this decrease in is due to the run off of depreciation related to certain assets which had reached the end of their depreciable lives by the end of in addition  during fiscal  we changed our estimate of the remaining useful lives of certain operating assets which resulted in an acceleration of depreciation which did not recur in fiscal our operating income decreased by million to an operating loss of million in from an operating income of million in this decrease is due to reduced volume  higher costs associated with purchasing semi finished aluminum coils from third parties  higher conversion costs associated with the processing of semi finished coils into finished sheet  and the impact of lower throughput which was exacerbated by a general decline in lme aluminum prices 
our operating income and 
table of contents margins are impacted by changes in lme aluminum prices  lme aluminum prices averaged around per pound in fiscal year  a drop compared to fiscal year  with a corresponding decline in aluminum scrap costs 
our aluminum products business is a high fixed cost business  so as volume of shipments drops  our ability to substantially reduce operating costs is limited  which thus results in a decline in our operating income 
corporate other for the years ended october  change change dollars in millions net sales cost of sales selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization operating income loss the net sales amounts represent inter segment revenue eliminations between the engineered products business and the aluminum sheet products business segments 
the cost of sales amounts represent lifo accrual adjustments  and inter segment eliminations between the engineered products business and the aluminum sheet products business segments 
for the years ended october  and  we recorded a benefit of million and an expense of million  respectively  for lifo accrual adjustments 
the changes in the lifo reserve are largely due to changes in aluminum pricing for ending inventories 
selling  general and administrative expense increased by million or  for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  the increase was largely attributable to higher costs associated with our company wide erp project initiative  which began in whereby we sought to implement a computer system to support the drive for long term organic growth and reduce the number of disparate systems in favor of a single standard system supported by a common set of processes 
expenses related to the erp implementation totaled million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal in addition  in the fiscal year  we incurred higher incentive and stock based compensation costs  higher mark to market expense associated with our deferred compensation plan  and higher costs related to higher headcount and employee costs  in support of the our strategic and operational initiatives 
partially offsetting these year over year expense increases were transaction related costs of approximately million incurred in fiscal associated with business acquisitions 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october   due primarily to the implementation of the human capital management module of the erp system  which provided million of incremental depreciation expense during fiscal the remainder of the increase was primarily related to the depreciation of other equipment  hardware and software acquired in liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of funds are cash on hand  cash flow from operations  and borrowings under our million senior unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility 
as of october  we had million of cash and equivalents  million of availability under the credit facility and outstanding debt of million  of which no amounts were outstanding under our credit facility 
cash and cash equivalents decreased by million during fiscal due primarily to the alumco asset acquisition  capital investments in our manufacturing facilities  the erp implementation project  dividends paid and on going operational activities  partially offset by cash generated from operations 
our strategy for deploying cash is to invest in organic growth opportunities  develop our infrastructure and make strategic acquisitions 
other uses of cash include paying cash dividends to our shareholders and opportunistically repurchasing our common stock 
any excess cash and cash equivalents are invested in overnight money market funds 
the funds are diversified by security type across treasuries  government agencies and prime corporate 
these funds are all aaa rated  approved by the national association of insurance commissioners and compliant with rule a of the investment company act of our investments are diversified across multiple institutions that we believe are financially sound 
we intend to remain in highly rated money market funds  financial institutions and treasuries following a prudent investment philosophy 
from time to time  to prepare for potential disruption in the money markets  we may temporarily move funds into operating bank accounts of highly rated financial institutions to meet on going operational liquidity requirements 
we did not experience any material losses on our cash and marketable securities investments during the years ended october   and 
table of contents prior to january   we maintained a million senior unsecured revolving credit facility the retired facility which had been executed on april  and was scheduled to mature on april  the retired facility provided for up to million of standby letters of credit  limited based on availability  as defined 
amounts borrowed under the facility were to bear interest at a spread above the london interbank borrowing rate libor based on a combined leverage and ratings grid 
in addition  the retired facility contained restrictive debt covenants  as defined in the indenture  and contained certain limits on additional indebtedness  asset or equity sales and acquisitions 
during the fiscal years ended october  and and for the period from november  through january   we were in compliance with our debt covenants and did not borrow funds pursuant to the retired facility 
on january   we replaced the retired facility by entering into a new million senior unsecured revolving credit facility that has a five year term  maturing on january   and which permits aggregate borrowings at any time of up to million  with a letter of credit sub facility  a swing line sub facility and a multi currency sub facility 
borrowings denominated in u 
s dollars bear interest at a spread above libor or a base rate derived from the prime rate 
foreign denominated borrowings bear interest at a spread above the libor applicable to such currencies 
subject to customary conditions  we may request that the aggregate commitments under the credit facility be increased by up to million  with total commitments not to exceed million 
the credit facility requires us to comply with certain financial covenants  the terms of which are defined therein 
specifically  we must not permit  on a quarterly basis  our ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense as defined minimum interest coverage ratio  to fall below or our ratio of consolidated funded debt to consolidated ebitda  as defined maximum consolidated leverage ratio  to exceed the maximum consolidated leverage ratio is the ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense  in each case for the previous four consecutive fiscal quarters 
ebitda is defined by the indenture to include proforma ebitda of acquisitions and to exclude certain items such as goodwill and intangible asset impairments and certain other non cash charges and non recurring items 
subject to our compliance with the covenant requirements  the amount available under the credit facility is a function of our trailing twelve month ebitda  the minimum interest coverage ratio and maximum consolidated leverage ratio allowed under the credit facility  and the aggregate amount of our outstanding debt and letters of credit 
as of october   we were in compliance with the financial covenants set forth in the credit facility  as indicated in the table below required actual minimum interest coverage ratio no less than maximum consolidated leverage ratio no greater than the credit facility also contains certain limitations on additional indebtedness  asset or equity sales and acquisitions 
the payment of dividends and other distributions is permitted  provided there is no event of default after giving effect to such transactions 
if the counterparties to the credit facility were unable to fulfill their commitments  the funds available to us could be reduced 
however  we have no reason to believe that such liquidity will be unavailable or reduced 
we believe that we have sufficient funds and adequate financial resources available to meet our anticipated liquidity needs 
we also believe our cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient in the next twelve months and foreseeable future to finance our anticipated working capital requirements  capital expenditures  debt service requirements  environmental expenditures  and dividends 
for the period from january  through october   we borrowed and repaid million under the credit facility  and thus had no outstanding borrowings at october  the weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings during the period from january  through october  was 
our borrowing rate under the credit facility was and for the swing line sub facility and the revolver  respectively  at october  the amount available to us for use under the credit facility as of october  was limited to million and we had outstanding letters of credit of million 

table of contents the following table summarizes our cash flow results for the years ended october   and year ended october  in millions cash flows from operating activities cash flows used in investing activities cash flows used in financing activities highlights from our cash flow results for the fiscal years ended october   and were as follows operating activities cash provided by operating activities increased by million for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  an increase in sales revenue and the timing of receivable collections contributed to higher gross cash inflows in  which was partially offset by the timing of the payments made to fund raw material purchases and other commitments  higher bonus payments  customer rebates  non capitalized erp expenditures  and transaction costs of approximately million related to the alumco acquisition which occurred in december cash provided by operating activities decreased by million for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  this decrease was primarily due to lower earnings  build up of inventory balances  the timing of payments associated with trade payables  a non recurring expense of million associated with the insulating glass plant consolidation  and an increase of million in our pension contributions 
working capital was million  million and million for the years ended october   and  respectively 
investing activities cash used for investing activities increased by million for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  these funds were used to purchase alumco for million  partially offset by a decrease in net capital expenditures of million 
excluding the erp implementation project  our primary capital project undertaken during was the installation of a new paint oven at one of our aluminum finishing facilities 
capital spending for the erp project for the year ended october  was million compared to million for fiscal cash used for investing activities decreased by million for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  of this amount  million was used in for business acquisitions  with no such transactions in  partially offset by an increase in cash used for capital expenditures in of million 
at october   we had firm purchase commitments of approximately million for the purchase or construction of capital assets 
we plan to fund these capital expenditures through cash from our operations 
financing activities for the years ended october   and  cash used for financing operations included payment of dividends of million  million and million  respectively  and net repayments of long term debt of million  million and million  respectively 
cash used for financing activities for the years ended october  and included amounts used to purchase treasury stock of million and million  respectively 
there were no purchases of treasury stock for the year ended october  partially offsetting these uses of cash were cash receipts associated with the issuance of common stock pursuant to stock option exercises which provided million  million and million for the year ended october   and  respectively 

table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our known contractual obligations and commitments as of october  payments due by period total thereafter contractual obligations in thousands long term debt  including interest operating leases unconditional purchase obligation total contractual cash obligations interest on our long term debt was computed using rates in effect at october  operating leases include facilities  light vehicles  forklifts  office equipment and other operating equipment 
the unconditional purchase obligation consists of scrap aluminum purchases 
this table excludes tax reserves recorded in accordance with asc topic income taxes  as we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to these reserves 
during fiscal  we expect to contribute approximately million to our pension plan to meet our funding threshold and maintain minimum contribution requirements 
pension contributions beyond cannot be determined since the amount of any contribution is heavily dependent on the future economic environment and investment returns on pension plan assets 
obligations are based on current and projected obligations of the plans  performance of the plan assets  if applicable  and any participant contributions 
at october   we have recorded a long term liability for deferred pension and postretirement benefits totaling million 
we believe the effect of the plans on liquidity is not significant to our overall financial condition 
our supplemental benefit plan and deferred compensation plan liabilities fluctuate based on changes in the market value of certain equity securities  including our common stock 
as of october   our liability under the supplemental benefit plan and the deferred compensation plan was approximately million and million  respectively 
of this amount  we expect to settle approximately million and million respectively  within one year as a result of the recent separation of three of our executive officers in the following table reflects other commercial commitments or potential cash outflows that may result from a contingent event  such as a need to borrow short term funds for liquidity purposes 
amount of commitment expiration per period total thereafter other commercial commitments in thousands standby letters of credit off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as such term is defined in the rules promulgated by the sec  that we believe would be material to investors and for which it is reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
effects of inflation although inflation does impact the cost of raw materials  labor and overhead  we are generally able to recover this cost through pricing 
the effect of price inflation in the united states in as compared to prior years has remained relatively low 
therefore  we believe inflation has not had a significant effect on our earnings or financial position 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty 
estimates may change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information becomes available and as our operating environment changes 
we base our estimates on historical 
table of contents experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  and that we believe provide a basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available through open market quotes 
we must use our judgment with regards to uncertainties in order to make these estimates 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following are the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as well as the significant judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies 
we consider an estimate to be critical if it is subjective and if changes in the estimate using different assumptions would result in a material impact to our financial position or results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when products are shipped and the title has passed to the customer 
revenue is deemed to be realized or earned when the following criteria is met a pervasive evidence that a contractual sales arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred  c the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and d collection is reasonably assured 
sales allowances and customer incentives are treated as reductions to revenue and are provided for based on historical experience and current estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record trade accounts receivable at billed amounts  less an allowance for doubtful accounts 
this allowance is established to estimate the risk of loss associated with our trade receivables which may arise due to the inability of our customers to pay or due to changes in circumstances 
the allowance is maintained at a level that we consider appropriate based on factors that affect collectability  including a historical trends of write offs  recoveries and credit losses  b the credit quality of our customers  and c projected economic and market conditions 
different assumptions or changes in economic circumstances could result in changes to the allowance 
our historical bad debt expense for the fiscal period has approximated of net sales 
if bad debt expense increased by of net sales  the impact would have been an increase in net loss of million and million for the years ended october  and  respectively  and a decrease in net income of million for the year ended october  environmental contingencies we are subject to extensive laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment and the remediation of chemical contamination 
to satisfy such requirements  we invest in capital and record expense associated with remediation efforts on an on going basis 
we accrue for remediation obligations using our best estimates and we adjust these accruals as further information becomes available and circumstances further develop 
our estimates may change substantially depending on information about the nature and extent of contamination  appropriate remediation technologies  and regulatory approvals 
in accruing for environmental remediation liabilities  costs of future expenditures are not discounted to their present value  unless the amount and timing of the expenditures are fixed or reliably determinable 
legal costs are expensed as incurred except incremental direct costs of the remediation effort which are accrued as part of the measurement of the environmental remediation liability 
when environmental laws might be deemed to impose joint and several liability for the costs of responding to contamination  we accrue our allocable share of the liability taking into account the number of parties participating  their ability to pay or access to resources  the volumes and nature of the wastes involved  the nature of anticipated response actions and the nature of our alleged connections 
recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when the receipt of funds is deemed probable 
unanticipated changes in circumstances and or legal requirements could extend the length of time over which we pay our remediation costs or could increase actual cash expenditures for remediation in any period 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets property  plant and equipment and intangible assets with defined lives we make judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of our long term assets  including property  plant and equipment  and identifiable intangibles 
these judgments may include the basis for capitalization  depreciation and amortization methods and the useful lives of the underlying assets 
in accordance with us gaap  we review the carrying values of these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we determine that the carrying amount is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
if the carrying value exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows and after considering alternate uses for the asset  an impairment charge would be recorded in the period in which such review is performed 
we measure the impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
fair value is determined by reference to quoted market prices in active markets  if available  or by calculating the discounted cash flows associated with the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
therefore  if there are indicators of impairment  we are required to make long term forecasts of our future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
forecasts require assumptions a 
table of contents bout demand for our products and future market conditions 
although there may be no indicators of impairment in the current period  unanticipated changes to assumptions or circumstances in future periods could result in an impairment charge in the period of the change 
for the years ended october   and  we recorded asset impairment charges of million  million and million  respectively 
we monitor relevant circumstances  including industry trends  general economic conditions  and the potential impact that such circumstances might have on the valuation of our identifiable intangibles 
events and changes in circumstances that may cause a triggering event and necessitate such a review include  but are not limited to a decrease in sales for certain customers  improvements or changes in technology  and or a decision to phase out a trademark or trade name 
such events could negatively impact the carrying value of our identifiable intangibles 
it is possible that changes in such circumstances or in the numerous variables associated with the judgments  assumptions  and estimates made by us in assessing the appropriate valuation of our identifiable intangibles could require us to further write down a portion of our identifiable intangibles and record related non cash impairment charges in the future 
we apply a variety of techniques to establish the carrying value of our intangible assets  including the relief from royalty and excess current year earnings methods 
goodwill the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets 
in accordance with us gaap  we review various qualitative factors to determine whether we believe there are indicators of impairment associated with goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets 
if no impairment is indicated  no additional testing is required 
otherwise  we perform a goodwill impairment test annually as of august  or more often if there are indicators of impairment due to changes in circumstances or the occurrence of certain events 
the test for impairment of goodwill requires a two step approach as prescribed in asc topic intangibles goodwill and other asc 
the first step of the impairment test is to compare the carrying value of each reportable unit  including goodwill  to the fair value as determined using various valuation methods or a weighting of several such methods 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further testing is required and there is no impairment charge 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  a second step of the goodwill impairment test is required  whereby we compare the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of a reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination under which the consideration paid equals the calculated fair value of the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill for the particular reporting unit 
we use the present value of future cash flows  discounted at our weighted average cost of capital  to determine fair value in combination with the market approach 
future cash flows are projected based upon our long term forecasts by reportable unit and an estimated residual value 
our judgment is required in the estimation of future operating results and in determining the appropriate residual values of our reportable units 
the residual values are determined by reference to an exchange transaction in an existing market for similar assets 
future operating results and residual values could reasonably differ from our estimates and a provision for impairment may be required in a future period depending upon such a change in circumstances or the occurrence of future events 
of the three reportable units tested as of august  the fair value of the net assets for two units well exceeded the carrying value  and the third exceeded the carrying value to a lesser extent 
this third unit was recently acquired and represented million of goodwill 
thus  there were no goodwill impairment charges recorded for the years ended october   and income taxes we operate in various jurisdictions and therefore our income tax expense relates to income taxes in the united states  united kingdom and germany  as well as local and state income taxes 
we recognize the effect of a change in tax rates in the period of the change 
we record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the amounts reported in our consolidated balance sheets  as well as net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards 
we evaluate the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets and determine if our business will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the net deferred tax assets 
we perform this review for recoverability on a jurisdictional basis  whereby we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets 
the weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence can be objectively verified 
cumulative losses in recent years is a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome in determining that a valuation allowance is not needed against deferred tax assets 
thus  it is generally difficult for positive evidence regarding projected future taxable income exclusive of reversing taxable temporary differences to outweigh objective negative evidence of recent financial reporting losses 
we evaluate recoverability based on an estimate of future taxable income using the long term forecasts we use to evaluate long lived assets  goodwill and intangible assets for impairment  taking into consideration the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and reviewing our current financial operations 
in the event that our estimates and assumptions indicate we 
table of contents will not generate sufficient future taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets  we will record a valuation allowance  to the extent indicated  to reduce our net deferred tax assets to their realizable value 
annually  we evaluate our tax positions to determine if there have been any changes in uncertain tax positions or if there has been a lapse in the statute of limitations with regards to such positions 
as of october  and  we recorded a liability for uncertain tax positions of million and million  respectively 
this liability stems from an unrecognized tax benefit from our spin off from our predecessor parent company as well as certain state tax items regarding the interpretation of tax laws and regulations 
the change in the liability between years is primarily due to the lapse of the statute of limitations 
we have reported losses for the past two years  which may indicate that our deferred tax assets are not fully realizable 
however  we believe we will have taxable income in and significant taxable income in the future to utilize our deferred tax assets as of october  there is a risk that our estimates related to the future use of loss carry forwards and our ability to realize our net deferred tax assets may not come to fruition  and that the results could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
future changes in tax laws or regulations could also impact our valuation allowances or the recognition of additional tax liabilities 
if we incur additional losses  we may be required to increase our valuation reserve against a portion of our deferred tax assets 
our deferred tax assets at october  totaled million against which we have recorded a valuation allowance of million 
insurance we manage our costs of workers compensation  group medical  property  casualty and other liability exposures through a combination of self insurance retentions and insurance coverage with third party carriers 
liabilities associated with our portion of this exposure are not discounted 
we estimate our exposure by considering various factors which may include historical claims experience  severity factors  estimated claims incurred but not reported and loss development factors  which are used to estimate as to how claims will develop over time until settled or closed 
while we consider a number of factors in preparing our estimate of risk exposure  we must use our judgment to determine the amounts to accrue in our financial statements 
actual claims can differ significantly from estimated liabilities if future claims experience differs from historical experience  and if we determine that our assumptions used for analysis or our development factors are flawed 
we do not recognize insurance recoveries until any contingencies relating to the claim have been resolved 
inventory we record inventory at the lower of cost or market value 
inventories are valued using the first in first out fifo and last in first out lifo methods 
we use the dollar value link chain lifo method  and the lifo reserve is calculated on a consolidated basis in a single consolidated pool 
we recorded a benefit of million associated with change in the lifo reserve for the year ended october  and a charge of million for the year ended october  we recorded a million benefit associated with the change in our lifo reserve for the year ended october  acquisitions are integrated into our operations with some valuing inventories on a lifo basis and others on a fifo basis 
fixed costs related to excess manufacturing capacity have been expensed in the period  and therefore  are not capitalized into inventory 
inventory quantities are regularly reviewed and provisions for excess or obsolete inventory are recorded primarily based on our forecast of future demand and market conditions 
significant unanticipated changes to our forecasts could require a change in the provision for excess or obsolete inventory 
for the years ended october   and  our inventory reserve excluding lifo reserve approximated of gross inventory 
assuming an increase in obsolescence equal to of inventory  the net loss would have increased by million for the years ended october  and and net income would have decreased by million for the year ended october  retirement plans we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan and an unfunded postretirement plan that provides health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees and dependents 
the measurement of liabilities related to these plans is based on our assumptions related to future events  including expected return on plan assets  rate of compensation increases  and heath care cost trend rates 
the discount rate reflects the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled on the measurement date 
we determine our discount rate based on a pension discount curve  and the rate represents the single rate that  if applied to every year of projected benefits payments  would result in the same discounted value as the array of rates that comprise the pension discount curve 
actual pension plan asset investment performance  as well as other economic experience such as discount rate and demographic experience  will either reduce or increase unamortized pension losses at the end of any fiscal year  which ultimately affects future pension costs 

table of contents the effects of the decrease in selected assumptions  assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for the pension plans in fiscal  is shown below increase in projected benefit obligation increase in net periodic benefit cost changes in assumptions dollar amounts in thousands decrease in discount rate decrease in expected long term rate of return on plan assets n a as of october   our projected benefit obligation pbo and accumulated benefit obligation abo exceeded the fair value of the plan assets by million and million  respectively 
as a comparison  our pbo and abo exceeded the fair value of plan assets by million and million  respectively  as of october  in  the discount rate decreased but our contributions  totaling million  more closely matched the increase in obligation 
during fiscal  we contributed approximately million to the pension plan to continue to target a funding threshold and to meet minimum contribution requirements 
we expect to continue to fund at this level for fiscal expected contributions are dependent on many variables  including the variability of the market value of the assets as compared to the obligation and other market or regulatory conditions 
in addition  we take into consideration our business investment opportunities and the cash requirements 
accordingly  actual funding may differ greatly from current estimates 
under us gaap  we are not required to immediately recognize the effects of a deviation between actual and assumed experience under our pension plan  or to revise our estimate as a result 
this approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and disclosed as an unrecognized gain or loss 
as of october  and  a net actuarial loss of million and million  respectively  was included in our accumulated comprehensive income loss 
there were no net prior service costs or transition obligations for the years ended october  and the effect on fiscal years after will depend on the actual experience of the plans 
mortality assumptions used to determine the obligations for our pension plans are related to the experience of the plans and to our third party actuary s best estimate of expected plan mortality 
stock based compensation we have issued stock based compensation in the form of stock options to directors  employees and officers  and non vested restricted stock awards to certain key employees and officers 
we apply the provisions of asc topic compensation stock compensation asc  to determine the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the black scholes valuation model 
we recognize the fair value as compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award based on awards ultimately expected to vest 
stock options granted to directors vest immediately while the stock options granted to our employees and officers typically vest ratably over a three year period with service and continued employment as the vesting conditions 
for new option grants to retirement eligible employees  we recognize expense and vest immediately upon grant  consistent with the retirement vesting acceleration provisions of these grants 
for employees near retirement age  we amortize such grants over the period from the grant date to the retirement date if such period is shorter than the standard vesting schedule 
for grants of non vested restricted stock  we calculate the compensation expense at the grant date as the number of shares granted multiplied by the closing stock price of our common stock on the date of grant 
this expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period 
our non vested restricted stock grants to officers and employees cliff vest over a three year period with service and continued employment as the only vesting criteria 
our fair value determination of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behavior over the expected term  our dividend rate  risk free rate and expectation with regards to forfeitures 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable 
because our employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options  and because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value  the valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of our employee stock options 
accordingly  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
we have granted other awards which are linked to the performance of our common stock  but will settle in cash rather than the issuance of shares of our common stock 
the value of these awards fluctuates with changes in our stock price  with the resulting gains or losses reflected in the period of the change 
we have recorded current and non current liabilities related to these awards reflected in our consolidated balance sheets at october  and  included elsewhere within this annual report on form k 

table of contents warranty obligations our estimated obligations for product warranties are accrued concurrently when revenue is recognized 
we record a provision for warranty obligations based on our historical experience and costs incurred for such obligations 
we adjust our warranty reserve for current conditions and other factors that we deem appropriate 
our ability to estimate our warranty obligations is subject to uncertainties and limited  to some extent  by our operating history  which may not be sufficient for new products or changes to existing products 
our warranty reserves at october  and were million and million 
assuming a increase in our warranty reserves  our net loss would have increased by million and million for the years ended october  and  respectively  and our net income would have been reduced by million for the year ended october  recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no

these disclosures assist users of financial statements in evaluating the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements on an entity financial position

if entities determine  on the basis of qualitative factors  it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test would be unnecessary 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to perform the first step of the two step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the entity is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
asu also provides entities with the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to the first step of the two step impairment test

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion of our exposure to various market risks contains forward looking statements regarding our estimates  assumptions and beliefs concerning our exposure 
although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable in light of information currently available to us  we cannot provide assurance that these estimates will not materially differ from actual results due to the inherent unpredictability of interest rates  foreign currency rates and metal commodity prices as well as other factors 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk our outstanding debt bears interest at variable rates and accordingly is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of our debt portfolio due to differences in market interest rates and the rates at the inception of the debt agreements 
based upon the balances of the variable rate debt at october   a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would have the effect of causing a million additional pre tax charge or credit to our statement of income 
commodity price risk we use various grades of aluminum scrap and minimal amounts of prime aluminum ingot as raw materials for our manufacturing processes 
the price of this raw material is subject to fluctuations due to many factors in the aluminum market 
in the normal course of business  in an effort to reduce the risk of fluctuating raw material prices  we enter into firm price raw material purchase commitments which are designated as normal purchases under asc as well as option contracts on the lme 
our risk management policy  as it relates to these lme forward purchase contracts and lme forward sales contracts  is to enter into contracts as needed  so that the raw material inventory levels are sufficient to meet committed sales orders 
we maintain a balanced metals book position which excludes a normal operational inventory level 
this operating inventory level as a matter of practice is not hedged against material price lme movements 
we believe this practice minimizes the likelihood of net transaction gains or losses on this inventory over the commodity price cycle 
we also enter into lme swap contracts to exchange variable pricing for fixed pricing for anticipated sales to our customers 
the notional volume and contract period coincide with the anticipated sales 
through the use of firm price raw material purchase commitments and lme contracts  we attempt to protect ourselves from the effects of changing prices of aluminum on our cost of sales 
to the extent that the raw material costs factored into the firm price sales commitments are matched with firm price raw material purchase commitments  changes in aluminum prices should have no effect 
while we consider the lme derivative contracts to provide an economic hedge against changes in aluminum prices  the derivatives have not been designated as hedges in accordance with asc for accounting purposes 
as such  any mark to market net gain or loss was recorded in cost of sales  with the offsetting asset or liability reflected on the balance sheet 
we primarily rely upon firm price raw material purchase commitments to protect cost of sales tied to firm price sales commitments 
the following table indicates the notional volume as well as the fair value of the open lme forward and swap contracts as october  and see derivative instruments and fair value measurement of assets and liabilities  note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

we have a monthly resin adjuster in place with the majority of our customers and resin supplier that is adjusted based upon published industry resin prices for the prior month 
this adjuster effectively shares the base pass through price changes of pvc with our customers commensurate with the market at large 
our long term exposure to changes in pvc prices is thus reduced due to the 
table of contents contractual component of the resin adjuster program  however  there is a level of exposure to short term volatility due to a one month lag 
we initiated an oil based materials surcharge on one of our major product lines  effective may  the surcharge is intended to offset the rising cost of products which are highly correlated to the price of oil  including butyl and other oil based raw materials 
the surcharge is in place with the majority of our customers who purchase these products and is adjusted monthly based upon the day average published price for brent crude 
the oil based raw materials purchased by us are subject to similar pricing schemes 
therefore  our long term exposure to changes in oil based raw material prices is significantly reduced under this surcharge program 
foreign currency rate risk our international operations have exposure to foreign currency rate risks  primarily due to fluctuations in the euro  the british pound and the canadian dollar 
from time to time  we enter into foreign exchange contracts associated with our operations to manage a portion of the foreign currency rate risk

although these derivatives hedge our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates  we do not apply hedge accounting and therefore  the change in the fair value of these foreign currency derivatives is recorded directly to other income and expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
to the extent the gain or loss on the derivative instrument offsets the gain or loss from the remeasurement of the underlying foreign currency balance  changes in exchange rates should have no effect
