item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations as well as other sections of this report contain certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of and involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including the risks we face described in item a  risk factors 
except to the extent required by law  we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is provided as a supplement to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition  the changes in our financial condition and our results of operations 
this item should be read in connection with our consolidated financial statements 
see item  exhibits and financial statement schedules 
we are a global producer of precision engineered electronic components and modules 
based on our estimates of the total annual revenues in our primary markets and our share of those markets relative to our competitors  we believe we are a leading global producer of electronic components and modules in the primary markets we serve 
we operate our business in three segments our network product group  which we refer to as network  our power product group  which we refer to as power  and our wireless product group  which we refer to as wireless 
network produces a variety of passive components that manage and regulate electronic signals for use in various devices used in local area and wide area networks  such as connectors  filters  filtered connectors  transformers  splitters  micro filters  baluns and chokes 
power primarily manufactures products that adjust and ensure proper current and voltage  limit distortion of voltage  sense and report current and voltage and cause mechanical movement or actuation  which includes power transformers  chokes  current and voltage sensors  ignition coils  automotive coils and military and aerospace products 
wireless manufactures products related to the capture or transmission of wireless communication signals  such as antennas  antenna modules and antenna mounting components 
historically  our gross margin has been significantly affected by product mix and capacity utilization 
the markets served by each of our segments are characterized by relatively short product life cycles  which causes significant product turnover each year and  subsequently  frequent variations in the prices of products sold 
due to the constantly changing quantity of parts each segment offers and the frequent changes in our average selling prices  we cannot isolate the impact of changes in unit volume and unit prices on our net sales or gross margin in any given period 
in addition  our operations are subject to changes in foreign exchange rates  especially the us dollar as compared to the euro and chinese renminbi  which affect our us dollar reported results of operations 
technology and strategic investments 
our products evolve along with changes in technology  changes in the availability and price of raw materials and changes in design preferences of the end users of our products 
also  regulatory requirements can occasionally impact the design and functionality of our products 
we address these dynamic conditions  as well as our customers desires  by continually investing in the development of each of our segments products and by maintaining a diverse product portfolio  which contains both mature and emerging technologies 
we remain committed to technological development through investing in research  development and engineering activities focused on designing next generation products  improving our existing products and improving our manufacturing processes 
if we determine that any of our segments manufacturing processes would benefit from capital investment  we may allocate resources to fund the expansion of property  plant and equipment used in these processes 
for example  we have committed capital to drive higher levels of automation throughout or manufacturing operations 
we also remain committed to the implementation of our new erp system to enhance visibility  reduce cost  and enhance customer service 
during our fiscal year  we completed the process of implementing our new erp system in the majority of our manufacturing plants in china as part of the phased implementation schedule 
the new erp system  which will replace multiple legacy systems of the company  is expected to be completed in cost reduction programs 
we continue to simplify our operations to optimally match our capacity to the current and anticipated revenues and unit demand of each of our operating segments 
specific actions to simplify our operations will dictate the future expenses associated with our cost reduction programs 
actions taken over the past several years  such as divestitures  plant closures  plant relocations  asset impairments and reduction in personnel  have resulted in the elimination of a variety of future costs 
the majority of these costs  not related to the impairment of long lived assets  represent the annual salaries and benefits of terminated employees  including both those related to manufacturing and those that provided selling  general and administrative services 
also  we have experienced depreciation savings from disposed equipment and reductions in rental expense from the termination of lease agreements 
historically  we have also reduced labor and overhead costs as a result of relocating factories with higher wage rates  such as those in southern china  to lower cost areas in the central regions of china 
the savings created by these cost reduction programs impact cost of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expenses  but the timing of such savings may not be apparent due to other performance factors such as unanticipated changes in demand  changes in unit selling prices  operational challenges and changes in operating strategies 

table of contents international operations 
at december   we had manufacturing operations in the us and china 
however  nearly all of our products are manufactured in china and sold to customers in china and other countries outside of the us our net sales are denominated primarily in us dollars  euros and chinese renminbi 
changing exchange rates often impact our financial results and our period over period comparisons 
this is particularly true of movements in the us dollar s exchange rate with the chinese renminbi and the euro  and each of these and other foreign currencies relative to each other 
sales and net earnings denominated in currencies other than the us dollar may result in higher or lower net sales and net earnings upon translation for our us dollar denominated consolidated financial statements 
also  net earnings may be affected by the mix of sales and expenses by currency within each of our segments 
foreign currency gains or losses may be incurred when non functional currency denominated transactions are remeasured to an operation s functional currency for financial reporting purposes 
an increase in the percentage of our transactions denominated in non us currencies may result in increased foreign exchange exposure on our consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  we may also experience a positive or negative translation adjustment to equity because our investments in non us dollar functional subsidiaries may translate to more or less us dollars in our consolidated financial statements 
divestitures 
we have completed divestitures to streamline our operations  to focus on our core businesses  to reduce our external debt and to strengthen our financial position 
in  we divested the european and asian businesses of our former electrical contact products segment net proceeds of approximately million 
we have had no continuing material involvement with any of our divested operations after each respective sale 
refer to note  divestitures and assets held for sale  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the divestitures 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate is affected by the proportion of our income earned in higher tax jurisdictions  such as those in europe and the united states  and income earned in lower tax jurisdictions  such as hong kong and china 
this mix of income can vary significantly from one period to another 
additionally  our effective income tax rate will be impacted from period to period by significant transactions and the deductibility or non deductibility of severance and impairment costs and other similar costs as well as by changes in our net deferred tax assets valuation allowance 
changes in operations  tax legislation  estimates  judgments and forecasts may also affect our tax rate from period to period 
our effective income tax rate is affected by the proportion of our income earned in higher tax jurisdictions  such as those in europe and the united states  and income earned in lower tax jurisdictions  such as hong kong and china 
this mix of income can vary significantly from one period to another 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the following accounting policies are considered to be the most critical as they require significant judgments and assumptions that involve inherent risks and uncertainties 
management estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 
inventory valuation we carry our inventories at lower of cost or market 
inventory provisions are created to write down excess and obsolete inventory to market value 
we utilize historical trends and customer forecasts to estimate the expected usage of our inventory that is on hand 
the establishment of inventory provisions requires judgments and estimates  which may change over time and may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates 
however  we do not believe that a reasonable change in these assumptions would result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  inventory purchases are based upon estimates of future demand that are based upon customer forecasts and the trend of product sales over recent historical periods 
if there is a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products or there is a higher risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements  than we may be required to write down our inventory  which would cause a negative impact to gross margin 
however  if we were subsequently able to sell or use a significant portion of inventory that was previously written down  our gross margin could be positively affected 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on product sales in the period when the sales process is complete 
this generally occurs when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  such as a sales contract or purchase order  title and risk of loss have been transferred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
title and risk of loss pass at the time of shipment for the majority of our sales 
we are not subject to any material customer acceptance provisions 
we provide warranties to our customers that are limited to rework or the replacement of products 
we will not accept returned goods until we authorize the return  which typically occurs within three months of product shipment 
we accrue for warranty returns based on historical experience and record changes in our warranty provision through costs of sales 
we have agreements with certain distributors that provide limited rights of return 
for instance  one agreement allows the distributor to return unsalable products based upon a percentage of qualified purchases  which we refer to as stock rotation 
another agreement provides credit to the distributor for the difference between our catalog price and a discounted price on specific parts  which we refer to as ship and debit 
we record a reduction of revenue with a corresponding increase in accrued expenses each period based on the historical experience of returns or credits under each of these programs 
we believe these agreements are customary in our industry  and have met each of the criteria established in the applicable accounting guidance prior to recognizing revenue 
we do not believe any of our discounts or return programs are material to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents divestiture accounting historically  we have engaged in divestitures to streamline our operations  to focus on our core businesses  to reduce our debt and to strengthen our financial position 
when the operations and cash flows of the divestiture have been or will be eliminated from our ongoing operations and  also  when we do not expect to have any significant continuing involvement with such operations  we may report the business that has either been disposed of  or is classified as held for sale  as a discontinued operation 
if we plan to dispose of the business by sale  we are required to report the divested business at the lower of its carrying amount or at its fair value less costs to sell in the period it is classified as held for sale 
these assessments require judgments and estimates which include determining when it is appropriate to classify the business as held for sale  if the business meets the specifications of a discontinued operation  determining the fair value of the business and determining the level and type of involvement  if any  we will have with the disposed business in the future 
furthermore  when removing the divested business from our consolidated balance sheets  and  if necessary  restating results in prior periods  we are required to make assumptions  judgments and estimates regarding  among other things  the assets  liabilities and activities of the business and their relation to our continuing businesses 
intangible assets  net we test our indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter  and  on an interim basis if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred 
we measure the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets  which consists of tradenames  using the relief from royalty method 
this method assumes that the tradenames have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them 
this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related tradenames  the appropriate royalty rate  and the weighted average cost of capital 
we conducted the assessment in the fourth quarter of and and determined that the fair value of our tradenames exceeded the carrying value and therefore was not impaired 
in the fourth quarter of  we tested the carrying value of our tradenames  which resulted in a non cash impairment charge of approximately million 
other finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives on a straight line basis over three to seven years 
we review intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the expected cash flows undiscounted and without interest  is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
in fiscal  we recorded a million impairment charge related to our wireless segment s intangible assets  including million of finite lived intangible assets due to withdrawal from the audio market  and million for a finite lived customer relationship intangible asset and million of goodwill as a result of an significant decline in the actual and forecasted sales and operating profit of the segment 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense or benefit is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and  also  for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
we must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and  also  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates  relative to our provision for income taxes  take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax law  or our interpretation of tax laws  and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
we maintain a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized based on consideration of all available evidence 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of our deferred tax assets also takes into account predictions of the amount and the categories of future taxable income  carry back and carry forward periods and tax strategies  which could impact the realization of a deferred tax asset 
as of december   we cannot sustain a conclusion that it was more likely than not that we would realize any of our deferred tax assets resulting from recent losses as well as other factors 
consequently  we continue to maintain a valuation allowance against those deferred tax assets 
we have maintained a valuation allowance as a result of weighing all positive and negative evidence  including our history of losses in recent years and the difficulty of forecasting future taxable income 
we intend to maintain a valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
actual operating results and the underlying amounts and categories of income in future years could result in our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes being inaccurate 
in the fourth quarter of  we reassessed our previous assertion with regard to permanently invested foreign earnings 
as a result of our assessment of our potential cash needs in the us in conjunction with certain distributions in we determined that million of previously unremitted foreign earnings would not be permanently reinvested and therefore we recorded a deferred tax liability in for the net tax effect of these earnings 
aside from this change  we have generally not provided for us and foreign withholding taxes on our non us subsidiaries undistributed earnings which are considered permanently reinvested 
we expect our foreign earnings will be used to service our non us debt and maintain our foreign operations and  thus are permanently reinvested outside of the us for the majority of our foreign earnings 
the majority of our cash requirements are generated by our non us subsidiaries  our manufacturing and operations are primarily outside of the us  and we anticipate that a significant portion of our opportunities for future growth will be outside the us in addition  we expect to use a significant portion of the cash to service debt outside of the us we continue to maintain our permanent reinvestment assertion with regard to the remaining undistributed earnings outside of the us as of december   the amount of cash associated with indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately million 
we do not anticipate the need to repatriate any of this cash 
should we need to repatriate this cash  the tax affect of repatriation will be minimized by other tax attributes  offsetting the tax effect of the repatriation 

table of contents defined benefit plans on december   we froze the plan benefits of domestic defined benefit retirement plan 
also  during we settled the obligations of our defined benefit supplemental executive retirement plan  which was contingent on the sale of electrical to a third party 
the costs and obligations of our defined benefit plans are dependent on actuarial assumptions 
these valuations reflect the terms of the plans and use participant specific information such as compensation  age  and years of service  as well as certain assumptions  including estimates of discount rates  expected return on plan assets  interest crediting rates  and mortality rates 
the discount rate is determined based on high quality fixed income investments that match the duration of expected benefit payments 
for our pension obligations in the united states  a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with varying maturities is used to discount expected benefit payments to their present value 
this generates our discount rate assumption for our domestic pension plan 
for our non us plans  we use the market rates for high quality corporate bonds to derive our discount rate assumption 
the expected return on plan assets represents a forward projection of the average rate of earnings expected from our invested pension assets 
we have estimated this rate based on historical returns of similarly diversified portfolios 
changes in these assumptions could result in different expense and liability amounts  as well as a change in future contributions to the plans 
however  we do not believe that a range of reasonable changes to these assumptions would result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statement 
refer to note  employee benefit plans  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details of the primary assumptions used in determining the cost and obligations of our defined benefit plans 
contingency accruals during the normal course of business  a variety of issues arise which may result in litigation  environmental compliance and other contingent obligations 
in developing our contingency accruals  we consider both the likelihood of a loss or incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of exposure 
we record contingency accruals when a liability is probable and the amount of exposure can be reasonably estimated 
we periodically evaluate available information to assess whether contingency accruals should be adjusted  which includes an assessment of legal interpretations  judicial proceedings  recent case law and specific changes or developments regarding known claims 
in future periods  we could be required to record additional expenses  if our initial estimates were too low  or reverse part of the charges that were initially recorded  if our estimates were too high 
additionally  the litigation costs we incur in connection with a contingency are expensed as incurred  since the nature of these costs is generally unpredictable and cannot be reasonably estimated prior to being incurred 
severance  impairment and other associated costs we record severance  asset impairments and other charges  such as contract terminations costs  in response to declines in demand that lead to excess capacity  changing technology and other factors 
these costs  which we refer to as restructuring costs  are expensed when we determine that we have incurred those costs and  also  the requirements for accrual have been met in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance 
restructuring costs are recorded based upon our best estimates at the time the action is initiated 
our actual expenditures for the restructuring activities may differ from the initially recorded costs 
if this occurs  we could be required either to record additional expenses in future periods  if our initial estimates were too low  or reverse part of the initial charges  if our initial estimates were too high

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the following table below shows our results of operations and sets forth the components of net income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated dollars in thousands results as of net sales change change net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses severance  impairment and other associated costs debt restructuring and related costs legal reserve cost related to unsolicited takeover attempt operating loss interest expense  net other income expense  net loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense net loss from continuing operations net loss from discontinued operations net loss net sales 
net sales increased by million or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily as a result of higher sales in wireless as sales to new antenna programs and customers continue to increase  partially offset by ongoing economic and industry weaknesses  which constrained demand for network and power products 
net sales for our three segments for the years ended december   december  and december  were as follows in millions network power wireless net sales gross profit 
in fiscal  gross profit was million  reflecting a million decrease from gross profit of million in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the lower gross profit compared to the prior year reflects higher labor costs  lower pricing and volumes for network and power products  the unfavorable mix effect of the growth of lower margin wireless products  and ramp up costs and inefficiencies associated with the growth in our wireless business 
in particular  incremental production expenses associated with our wireless operations in korea increased cost of sales by million during fiscal during the third quarter of we shut down our manufacturing operations in korea and transferred production to other manufacturing facilities 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to aggressive expense reduction actions  a million favorable impact of reaching an agreement on intellectual property licensing  and sustained scrutiny over all discretionary spending 

table of contents research  development and engineering expenses rd e are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december  and december   respectively  rd e was as follows in thousands rd e percentage of sales our rd e spending as a percentage of sales in fiscal decreased primarily due to cost reduction actions taken in the prior year  partially offset by higher legal expenses incurred in connection with the patent lawsuit filed by halo electronics 
during fiscal and we incurred approximately million and million of legal expenses  respectively  related to this matter 
refer to further discussion in note  commitments and contingencies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
severance  impairment and other associated costs 
during fiscal  we incurred a charge of million  which included million for severance  lease termination and other costs associated with our restructuring program to reduce and reorganize the capacity of our manufacturing plants in china as we shift manufacturing to lower cost facilities 
additionally  million related to global workforce reductions  primarily in europe  million related to severance and million for the write down of fixed assets no longer in use as a result of the shutdown of our korea manufacturing operations and relocation of this manufacturing to facilities in china  and million of additional costs associated with our withdrawal from wireless audio components business  which we initiated and substantially completed in these costs were partially offset by a million favorable settlement on our remaining lease obligations for our former headquarters 
debt restructuring and related costs 
in fiscal  we incurred million of costs related to financing and strategic alternatives we were pursuing to increase liquidity and repay the borrowings under our senior credit facility by its maturity date in february the majority of these costs represented fees of our financial and legal advisors 
these refinancing efforts were completed at the end of with the completion of the first phase of the recapitalization with oaktree 
legal reserve 
during fiscal  we recorded litigation reserves totaling million related to the halo lawsuit and turkish vat related dispute 
during fiscal  the company recorded a litigation reserve in the amount of million in connection with the halo lawsuit 
both of these lawsuits are further described in note  commitments and contingencies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
costs related to unsolicited takeover attempt 
during fiscal  we recorded a million gain due to a settlement with an advisor regarding amounts owed for services rendered in the prior year in connection with our unsolicited takeover defense 
during fiscal  we incurred million of legal and professional fees and other costs relating to this matter 
interest 
net interest expense increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal during fiscal  our weighted average interest rate increased by approximately  which was primarily due to higher interest costs under the march amendment to our senior credit facility and the oaktree term loans issued in november also  interest expense increased during fiscal due to higher debt fee amortization as a result of amortization of loan costs incurred on the march amendment to our senior credit facility  including warrants issued in connection with this amendment  as well as the amortization of discounts and loan fees incurred on the oaktree term loans 
additionally  we recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of million in connection with the oaktree recapitalization 
see note  debt  in our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
other 
during fiscal  we incurred million of other income  net  which primarily consisted of a million unrealized gain on the liability classified warrant liability we issued to oaktree in connection with the oaktree recapitalization and a million gain on the sale of assets related to the sale of equipment and a manufacturing plant in china 
during fiscal  we incurred losses on net foreign exchange activity related to changes in the varying currencies of our intercompany lending program of million  partially offset from the reversal of a contingency accrual that was originally recorded in purchase accounting for an acquisition 
income taxes 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was a tax expense of compared to for the year ended december  we maintain a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized based on consideration of all available evidence 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of our deferred tax assets also takes into account predictions of the amount and the categories of future taxable income  carry back and carry forward periods and tax strategies which could impact the realization of a deferred tax asset

actual operating results and the underlying amounts and categories of income in future years could result in our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes being inaccurate 

table of contents the effective tax rate was primarily impacted by a tax reserve that was recorded in connection with an audit in a foreign jurisdiction as well as us and foreign withholding taxes incurred 
the tax rate was not impacted by the change in our assertion of previously permanently reinvested foreign earnings and the establishment of a deferred tax liability  due to the offsetting reversal of available offsetting valuation allowance in the us the effective tax rate was primarily impacted by a valuation allowance that we recorded against our deferred tax assets based on a determination that it was not more likely than not that we would realize any of these deferred tax assets due to recent losses and other factors 
in addition  the effective tax rate was also impacted by the recording of a tax reserve related to an audit in a foreign jurisdiction and the release of a tax reserve related to actions to streamline our legal entity structure  specifically the dissolution of a non us legal entity  which we no longer operate  and lapses in statutes of limitation 
discontinued operations 
during fiscal  our results from discontinued operations included million of costs relating to certain legal matters related to our former medtech operations 
during fiscal  we recorded million of income to reflect updated estimates of the net proceeds we expected to receive upon the disposition of the remaining operations of electrical contract products segment  offset by million of costs incurred in connection with the electrical sale to reimburse the buyer for certain contingent costs that we were obligated to pay under the sale agreement 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the following table below shows our results of operations and sets forth the components of net income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated dollars in thousands results as of net sales change change net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses severance  impairment and other associated costs legal reserve cost related to unsolicited takeover attempt operating loss interest expense  net other income  net loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense net loss from continuing operations net loss from discontinued operations net loss net sales 
net sales decreased by million or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal year  as a result of lower demand in network due to lower industry demand and the utilization of remaining inventory purchased by certain customers during we also experienced a decline in sales of our wireless products in the mobile handset market 
these declines were partially offset by an increase in sales to new antenna customers by wireless 
the foreign currency effect on our us dollar reported sales were neutral when comparing the results for fiscal and the prior year 
gross profit 
in fiscal gross profit was million  reflecting a million decrease  from gross profit of million in fiscal primarily the result of lower demand  higher wage rates  higher raw material costs  and lower pricing for certain network and power products 
partially offsetting these decreases was the effect of continued migration of our manufacturing to lower cost existing facilities located in central china in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily due to lower costs as a result of expense reductions announced earlier in  lower business volumes  and the effects of prudent expense management 

table of contents research  development and engineering expenses rd e are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
for fiscal and  respectively  rd e was as follows in thousands rd e percentage of sales our rd e spending as a percentage of sales for fiscal is relatively consistent with the prior year 
we believe that future sales in the electronic components markets will be driven by next generation products 
as a result  design and development activities with our oem customers continue at an aggressive pace that is consistent with market activity 
also  included in rd e expense during fiscal and was approximately million and million of legal expenses  respectively  which we incurred in connection with the patent lawsuit filed by halo electronics 
severance  impairment and other associated costs 
during fiscal  we incurred a charge of million including million of severance and related costs  million of lease termination costs  million of fixed asset write downs that are no longer in use  and a million write down of a manufacturing facility to its fair value 
of the million restructuring charge incurred during the year ended december   approximately million related to the transition and reorganization of our corporate headquarters in north america  which was initiated in the first quarter of and was completed before the end of during fiscal  we determined that approximately million of our wireless reporting unit s goodwill was impaired  including million of technology related to our audio products 
additionally  we incurred a charge of million for a number of cost reduction actions 
these charges include severance  related payments of million and fixed asset impairments of million 
the impaired assets were identified in and primarily include production lines associated with products that have no expected future demand and two real estate properties  which were disposed 
legal reserve 
during fiscal  the company recorded a legal reserve of million in connection with the halo lawsuit which is further described in note  commitments and contingencies  in our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
costs related to unsolicited takeover attempt 
during fiscal  we incurred million of legal and professional fees and other costs related to bel fuse s unsolicited takeover attempt 
the majority of these costs represent fees of our financial and legal advisors 
interest 
net interest expense increased by million primarily due to an increase in our debt fee amortization of million due to fees incurred in connection with the amendment to our senior revolving credit facility in august and a write down of previously capitalized debt fees 
in addition  interest expense on our senior revolving credit facility had been allocated between continuing operations and discontinued operations on a pro rata basis based upon the debt repaid from the disposition of our discontinued operations as compared to our total debt outstanding during fiscal resulting in lower interest expense from continuing operations 
other 
net other expense during fiscal is primarily attributable to net foreign exchange activity related to changes in the varying currencies of our intercompany lending program of million  partially offset from the reversal of a contingency accrual that was originally recorded in purchase accounting for a legacy acquisition 
during fiscal  we incurred foreign exchange losses of approximately million during the comparable period of the decreased exposure in foreign currency changes was the result of continued simplification efforts and the reduction of legal entities 
also  included in net other expense for fiscal was a loss recorded to write down an available for sale property to the net proceeds received on its sale 
income taxes 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was a tax expense of compared to an expense of for fiscal the increase in our expense was primarily due to an increase in the amount of our valuation allowance by approximately million in  of which million resulted in an increase in income tax expense 
we maintain a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized based on consideration of all available evidence 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of our deferred tax assets also takes into account predictions of the amount and the categories of future taxable income  carry back and carry forward periods and tax strategies  which could impact the realization of a deferred tax asset 
as of december   we could not sustain a conclusion that it was more likely than not that we would realize any of our deferred tax assets resulting from recent losses as well as other factors 
consequently  we recorded an increase in our valuation allowance against those deferred tax assets 
the increased valuation allowance was recorded as a result of weighing all positive and negative evidence  including our history of losses in recent years and the difficulty of forecasting future taxable income 
we intend to maintain a valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
actual operating results and the underlying amounts and categories of income in future years could result in our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes being inaccurate 
the effective tax rate was also impacted by the recording of tax reserve related to audit in a foreign jurisdiction and the release of tax reserve related to actions to streamline our legal entity structure  specifically the dissolution of a non us legal entity which we no longer operate and lapses in statutes of limitation 

table of contents discontinued operations 
net loss from discontinued operations was less than million during fiscal as compared to a loss of approximately million during the comparable period of during fiscal  we recorded million of income to reflect updated estimates of the net proceeds we expect to receive upon the disposition of the remaining operations of electrical  offset by million of costs incurred in connection with the electrical sale to reimburse the buyer for certain contingent costs that we were obligated to pay under the sale agreement 
during fiscal  our results from discontinued operations included a gain recorded upon the completion of the sale of our electrical business and a gain recorded on the medtech divestiture as a result of settling an unresolved matter that existed at the date of sale 
liquidity and capital resources our primary capital requirements are to fund working capital needs and operating expenses  meet required interest and principal payments  and fund capital expenditures 
in the past  our capital resources have primarily consisted of cash flows from operations and borrowings under previous credit facilities 
since  our revenues and earnings have decreased significantly due to a variety of factors including recessionary economic conditions  weaknesses in our specific markets  and the negative effects of leverage and debt service costs  including interest expense 
as a result  we faced liquidity and capital resource challenges  and have also suffered a decline in the market capitalization of our common stock 
in response to these liquidity and capital resource challenges  in november  we entered into agreements with oaktree to recapitalize our company 
we believe that the closing of the oaktree recapitalization achieved our goals of improving liquidity  addressing the maturity of our senior credit facility  and reducing cash debt service costs 
it also allows the focus of our organization to return to improving operational performance and renewing revenue and profit growth 
cash and cash equivalents the company had million of cash and cash equivalents at december  compared with million at december  the increase in cash mainly reflects the proceeds from the investment by oaktree described below that were in excess of debt repayments  transaction fees and expenses  and immediate working capital needs 
we continue to analyze and review various strategies to efficiently reinvest cash outside of the us if any of these earnings were repatriated from our non us subsidiaries  it may require the payment of additional taxes 
at december   a majority owned foreign subsidiary and its subsidiaries held approximately million of our total consolidated cash and cash equivalents 
permanent access to funds from this subsidiary could be in the form of a dividend to its shareholders  which could result in income and withholding taxes and distributions to minority shareholders 
repatriation of some of these funds could be subject to delay for local country approvals and could have potential adverse tax consequences 
management does not believe such restrictions will limit the company s ability to pursue its intended business strategy 
in connection with the on going simplification and restructuring efforts of the company  significant amounts of non us cash on hand may be used during to further these objectives and improve the operating efficiency of the company 
cash flow from operating activities net cash used in operating activities during was million compared to million for the comparable period in  a decrease of million

net cash used in operating activities was million during fiscal as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million in the comparable period of  a decrease of million 
the decline was primarily attributable to a net decrease in cash provided by working capital changes in as compared to and higher net losses incurred in as compared to revenue declined by approximately from to  due primarily to softness in the markets for our network products

capital expenditures in both periods also reflect the development and continuing implementation of our erp system  as well as initiatives to drive higher levels of automation throughout our manufacturing operations and investments in programs which we believe are essential to our future growth primarily related to our wireless and network segments 
cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal was million 
the primary source of cash from financing activities was million of proceeds from long term borrowings 
the primary use of cash for financing activities included a million repayment of our senior credit facility  million of debt issuance costs relating to our senior credit facility amendment in march and refinancing with oaktree  and a million dividend paid to minority shareholders of our majority owned non us subsidiary

financing transactions on november   we entered into a credit agreement with oaktree pursuant to which oaktree extended a new million senior secured term a loan and exchanged approximately million principal amount and unpaid interest of our outstanding senior convertible notes for a new million secured term b loan 
we used approximately million of the proceeds to retire our senior credit facility and are using the remaining million for working capital  transaction fees  general business purposes  and to increase our cash on hand 
the interest rate on the term a loan is per annum  and the interest rate on the term b loan is per annum 
interest on each term loan may  at our election  be paid in cash or paid in kind in the form of additional principal for the first three years 
we plan to pay the interest due on these term loans in the form of additional principal for the first three years 
these new term loans mature on november  and are secured by a first lien on the collateral that secured our pre existing senior secured credit facility and on our available unencumbered assets 
the term loans are non amortizing and may be prepaid without any penalty 
while the term b loan is not junior in relative lien priority to the term a loan  the term b loan may not be repaid until the term a loan is paid in full 
we incurred approximately million of loan costs and fees related to the oaktree term loans  which have been capitalized as debt issuance costs and are being amortized using the effective interest rate method through the maturity date of the debt 
outstanding borrowings are subject to leverage covenants computed on a quarterly basis as of the most recent quarter end 
these covenants require the calculation of a rolling four quarter ebitda as defined in the credit agreement 
on march   oaktree agreed to forbear from taking any action  including acceleration of payment of the term loans  if we fail to satisfy these covenants as further explained below 
the secured leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of consolidated secured debt  which includes the oaktree term loans  and our rolling four quarters ebitda 
the total net debt leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of a the sum of consolidated debt  which includes the oaktree term loans and senior convertible notes  less unrestricted cash as defined in the credit agreement and b our rolling four quarters ebitda

oaktree agreed to forbear from taking any action  including acceleration of payment of the term loans  if we fail to satisfy these covenants in the fourth quarter of and for each quarter in in a forbearance and commitment letter dated march  oaktree agreed to forbearance with respect to the secured leverage ratio  the total net debt leverage ratio  and minimum liquidity restrictions 
the credit agreement also includes events of default  including receipt of a judgment or order for payment in excess of the threshold amount as defined in the credit agreement

table of contents upon closing of the oaktree term loans  we issued to oaktree million shares of our common stock and a warrant to issue of the common stock of a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the warrant was issued pending shareholder approval of an amendment to the company articles of incorporation that would authorize the issuance of series a non voting preferred stock 
upon approval of the amendment at a special shareholder meeting on january   the warrant was terminated and  shares of series a non voting preferred stock of the company were issued to oaktree 
refer to further discussion of the liability classified warrant in note  warrant and preferred stock  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the series a preferred stock will convert into common stock at such time that the million of outstanding senior convertible notes have been discharged or conversion of the preferred stock would not otherwise constitute a change in control under the terms of the senior convertible notes 
as of december   in accordance with the investment agreement  the preferred stock was convertible into such number of shares of our common stock that would result in oaktree having received of our total common stock on a fully diluted basis as of november   and without giving effect to shares of common stock and warrants previously owned by oaktree 
as discussed below  a forbearance and commitment letter in march adjusted the preferred stock conversion ratio to of our total common stock on a pro forma fully diluted basis as defined in the investment agreement 
as a result  as of march   the number of common shares into which the preferred stock will be converted will be within a range of million shares to million shares of common stock 
on march   the company entered into a letter agreement which included an incremental term loan commitment of million upon which we may draw if our common stock is delisted and the holders of our senior convertible notes require us to repurchase these notes 
terms of the incremental term loan will be identical to those of term a loan 
in consideration for the forbearance and additional commitment we have agreed to adjust the conversion ratio for the preferred stock held by oaktree such that the total common stock issued to oaktree upon conversion of the preferred stock will equal approximately of our total common stock on a pro forma fully diluted basis as of november   and without giving effect to shares of common stock and warrants previously owned by oaktree 
in the second phase of the oaktree recapitalization  we plan to each holder of our outstanding senior convertible notes the option to receive  in exchange for their senior convertible notes  i new term b loan debt in a principal amount equaling up to of the principal amount of such holder s senior convertible notes and ii shares of common stock the exchange offer 
to the extent  following the completion of the exchange offer  the holders of or more of the senior convertible notes  including those already exchanged by oaktree  have exchanged their senior convertible notes for term b loans and common stock  the principal amount of oaktree term b loan will be reduced by 
if all of the senior convertible notes are retired  following completion of the exchange offer  the former holders of such senior convertible notes will hold million shares of common stock or of our common stock on a pro forma fully diluted as defined in the investment agreement as of november  at december   we have million of senior convertible notes that will mature on december  the notes bear a coupon rate of per annum 
on november   we exchanged million of principal and unpaid interest on our outstanding senior convertible notes held by oaktree for a million secured term b loan as part of the oaktree recapitalization 
the remaining million of outstanding senior convertible notes may be settled prior to maturity depending on the outcome of the exchange offer described above 
there can be no assurance that the exchange offer will be accepted in whole or in part by the holders of the senior convertible notes 
to the extent we issue or sell additional shares of common stock in the market  we may be required to issue additional shares of common stock to oaktree under a top up option in the investment agreement 
the top up option provides that oaktree will have the option to purchase a number of additional shares of common stock to regain their ownership percentage in the company 
oaktree ownership percentage is of the company total common stock on a fully diluted basis  as defined in the investment agreement prior to the conversion of the preferred stock held by oaktree into shares of common stock and of the company total common stock on a fully diluted basis as defined in the investment agreement following conversion of the preferred stock into shares of common stock 
on march   we amended our previous senior credit facility and the revised terms reduced the borrowings permitted under the credit facility from million to million  increased the interest rate on the outstanding borrowings to a combination of variable rate of libor plus  reduced our permitted capital expenditures and reduced the available cash we were required to maintain 
we incurred fees and expenses related to the march amendment  including million of fees upon execution of the amendment  legal fees  and other expenses 
in addition  we recorded a charge of approximately million to write off previously capitalized fees and costs that related to the credit facility and its amendments 
the senior credit facility was scheduled to mature in february  however  we repaid the million outstanding under the credit facility on november  in conjunction with the issuance of the oaktree term loans described above 
in connection with the march amendment to the senior credit facility  we issued to the bank group at that time warrants to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants vested over time until we repaid the outstanding borrowings under the senior credit facility in full by certain dates 
consequently  warrants to purchase approximately million shares of common stock became vested during the year ended december   of which million warrants have been exercised 
warrants to purchase approximately million additional shares of common stock reverted back to us and were canceled upon retirement of the outstanding borrowings under the senior credit facility on november  
table of contents certain other matters relating to liquidity on september   the new york stock exchange the nyse or the exchange notified us that we had fallen below the nyse s continued listing standard for average market capitalization because we failed to maintain an average market capitalization over a consecutive day trading period of at least million 
on october   the nyse notified us that we failed to meet an additional listing standard because the average closing share price of our common stock was below the nyse s minimum standard of per share during a consecutive trading day period 
on november   we submitted a plan for remediation of the deficiency related to the market capitalization and stockholders equity requirements to the nyse  which they accepted on january  the company will be required to provide the exchange staff with updates in connection with the initiatives of the plan of compliance at least quarterly or upon the exchange s request and the exchange staff will review the company periodically for compliance with the plan during the extension periods 
failure to make progress consistent with the plan of compliance or to regain compliance with the continued listing standards by the end of the applicable extension periods could result in the company being delisted from the exchange 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to make progress consistent with its plan to regain compliance with the exchange s continued listing standards in a timely manner  or at all 
we will need to achieve the minimum continued listing standards at the completion of the month plan period 
additionally  we are allowed a six month cure period to regain the minimum average closing share price of  unless a corporate action requiring shareholder approval is contemplated 
if the company determines to remedy the non compliance by taking action that will require shareholder approval  such as a reverse stock split  the nyse will continue to list the common stock pending shareholder approval by no later than its next annual meeting  and the implementation of such action promptly thereafter 
we face the risk that the average market capitalization and average closing share price may not rise to a level necessary to satisfy the nyse requirements 
notwithstanding this nyse rule s six month cure period for securities that trade below the minimum average closing price  if our common stock price falls below the threshold during the six month cure period to the point where the nyse considers the stock price to be abnormally low  the nyse has the discretion to begin delisting proceedings immediately with respect to our company 
the market capitalization requirements further provide that the nyse will promptly initiate suspension and delisting procedures with respect to our common stock if our global market capitalization for consecutive trading days is less than million  in which case we would not be eligible to utilize the cure procedures provided by the nyse in other circumstances 
a delisting of our common stock is likely to reduce the liquidity of our common stock and may inhibit or preclude our ability to raise additional financing and may also materially and adversely impact our credit terms with our vendors 
additionally  if our common stock is not listed on the nyse or another national exchange  holders of our senior convertible notes due december  will be entitled to require us to repurchase these notes 
except as provided in the forbearance and commitment letter with oaktree of march   we can give no assurance that we would be able to repay the senior convertible notes in fiscal  prior to the maturity date  or obtain any required replacement financing 
we are a party to various legal proceedings  claims and assessments that arise in the ordinary course of business  and may continue to incur significant costs in defending or settling legal matters 
the total amount and timing of the expected future payments related to these matters cannot be estimated due to the uncertainty of the duration of the legal proceedings and the ultimate scope of other claims 
however  an unfavorable outcome in a single matter or in multiple legal matters during the same reporting period could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results from operations and cash flows 
refer to note  commitments and contingencies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of certain legal proceedings 
our domestic defined benefit retirement plan has been subject to the pursuit of an alleged claim relating to the sale of our electrical segment in by the pension benefit guarantee corporation pbgc 
communications from the pbgc have indicated that the sale of electrical s north america operations may have resulted in a partial plan termination 
in february  we had preliminary discussions with the pbgc whereby we offered to make periodic payments through to fund the plan by million 
the potential additional funding would have no impact on the liability recorded as of december  there can be no assurance that the final terms of any agreement reached with the pbgc will reflect the terms offered by the company in these preliminary discussions 
we expect to contribute approximately million to our defined benefit plans in our retained earnings are free from legal or contractual restrictions as of december   with the exception of approximately million of subsidiary retained earnings primarily in china that are restricted in accordance with section of the prc foreign investment enterprises law 
the million includes approximately million of retained earnings of a majority owned subsidiary 
the amount restricted in accordance with the prc foreign investment enterprise law is applicable to all foreign investment enterprises doing business in china 
the restriction applies to of our net earnings in china  limited to of the total capital invested 

table of contents contractual obligations as of december   future payments related to contractual obligations were as follows in thousands amounts expected to be paid by period total less than year to years to years thereafter senior convertible notes oaktree term a loan oaktree term b loan interest on long term debt operating leases excludes other obligations under employment contracts that are generally only payable upon a change of control 
the oaktree term loans permit us during the first three years of the agreement  in lieu of cash payment  to pay interest in kind such that amounts due for interest are added to the outstanding balance of the facility 
this table assumes that interest will be paid in kind through the first three years of the facility 
with interest paid in kind  the million borrowed on november  would increase to million when the oaktree credit facility comes due in five years 
in the schedule of estimated future payments related to our contractual obligations  we excluded unrecognized tax benefits due to the uncertainty of the amount and the period of payment 
as of december   we had unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million 
refer to note  income taxes  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements  transactions  obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december   our oaktree term loans and convertible senior notes both have fixed interest rates  so consequently we are not exposed to cash flow risk from market interest rate changes on these notes 
foreign currency risk as of december   we had a substantial amount of assets denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we conduct business in various foreign currencies  including those of non hyperinflationary emerging market countries in asia as well as european countries 
we may utilize derivative financial instruments  such as forward exchange contracts in connection with fair value hedges  to manage foreign currency risks 
gains and losses related to fair value hedges are recognized in income along with adjustments of carrying amounts of the hedged items 
therefore  all of our forward exchange contracts are marked to market  and unrealized gains and losses are included in current period net income 
these contracts guarantee a predetermined rate of exchange at the time the contract is purchased 
this allows us to shift the majority of the risk of currency fluctuations from the date of the contract to a third party for a fee 
we believe there are two primary risks of holding these instruments 
the first is that the foreign currency being hedged could move in a direction which would create a better economic outcome than if the hedging instrument was not in place 
the second risk is that the counterparty to a currency hedge defaults on its obligations 
during the year ended december   we settled all previously outstanding forward contracts 
at december   we had six foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding to sell forward approximately million euro  or approximately million  to receive chinese renminbi 
the fair value of these forward contracts was a liability of million as determined through use of level inputs
