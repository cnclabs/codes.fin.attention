item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview political and economic environment the us government continues to face substantial fiscal and economic challenges that affect funding for its non discretionary and discretionary budgets 
part i of the budget control act of budget control act provided for a reduction in defense budgets by at least billion over a ten year period 
part ii provided the potential for substantial additional reductions  through a process known as sequestration 
the president proposed fiscal year fy budget represented a slight decline for defense from fy while congress has not passed a fy budget  it did pass a six month continuing resolution that funds the us government through march  this continuing resolution restricts new starts and provides for discretionary spending levels that represent a slight increase over the fy budget 
it is unclear whether annual appropriations bills will be passed during fy the us government may operate under a continuing resolution for all of fy  restricting new contract or program starts for that year 
the american taxpayer relief act of was enacted in january it addressed a number of tax code provisions and certain spending issues but left in place the sequester although delaying its implementation to march  and did not address other fiscal matters such as the debt ceiling 
the nation debt ceiling is currently expected to be reached during the first half of congress and the administration continue to debate these issues and the terms of a possible national fiscal approach 
the outcome of that debate could have a significant impact on future defense spending plans 
while the president proposed fy budget is scheduled for release in february  its delivery may be delayed given these unresolved broad fiscal matters 
the congressional budget process to finalize fy defense spending also has been marked by continued uncertainty and significant debate  increasing the possibility of sequestration occurring 
as noted above  the budget control act calls for additional substantial defense spending reductions through sequestration  if congress is unable to agree on a budget that conforms with the budget control act requirements 
should sequestration  as currently mandated  be implemented in march  absent any other changes  we expect it would have serious negative consequences for the security of our country  the defense industrial base  including northrop grumman  and the customers  employees  suppliers  investors  and communities that rely on the companies in the defense industrial base 
there continues to be much uncertainty also regarding how sequestration would be implemented  if it were to go into effect 
there are many variables in how the law could be applied that make it difficult to determine the specific impacts 
however  we expect that sequestration  as currently provided for under the budget control act  would result in lower revenues  profits and cash flows for our company 
members of congress are discussing various options to address sequestration automatic spending cuts 
while we cannot predict the outcome of these efforts  it is likely that budget decisions made in this environment will have long term consequences for our company and the entire defense industry 
in addition to fiscal and budgetary constraints  we expect defense spending to be affected by the drawdown of us force levels tied to current major overseas deployments and other shifts in defense missions and priorities 
as overall defense spending declines  the department of defense dod is continuing to re evaluate the role and structure of the us military 
in  the dod announced a new defense strategy intended to guide its priorities and budgeting decisions 
the guidance calls for the us military to project power globally and operate effectively in all domains  including cybersecurity  and it places particular emphasis on asia pacific as an area of strategic focus 
we believe that spending on recapitalization  modernization and maintenance of defense  intelligence  and homeland security assets will continue to be a national priority 
future defense spending is expected to include the development and procurement of new manned and unmanned military platforms and systems along with advanced electronics and software to enhance the capabilities of existing individual systems and provide real time integration of individual surveillance  information management  strike  and battle management platforms 
we expect significant new competitive opportunities to include long range strike  missile defense  command and control  network communications  enhanced situational awareness  satellite systems  restricted programs  cybersecurity  technical services and information technology contracts  as well as numerous international and homeland security programs

table of contents northrop grumman corporation operating performance assessment and reporting we manage and assess the performance of our business based on our performance on contracts and programs two or more closely related contracts  with consideration given to the critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments described later in this section 
revenue on our portfolio of long term contracts is generally recognized using the percentage of completion method  primarily the cost to cost method  but in some cases the units of delivery method of percentage of completion accounting 
as a result  sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs across our large portfolio of contracts 
due to federal acquisition regulations far rules that govern our business  most types of costs are allowable  and we do not focus on individual cost groupings such as manufacturing  engineering  and design labor costs  subcontractor costs  material costs  overhead costs  and general and administrative costs  as much as we do on total contract costs  which is the key driver of both sales and operating income 
our contract management process involves the use of contract estimates at completion eacs that are generally prepared and evaluated on a bottoms up basis at least annually and reviewed on a quarterly basis over the contract period of performance 
these eacs include an estimated contract operating margin based initially on the contract award amount  adjusted to reflect estimated risks related to contract performance 
these risks typically include technical risk  schedule risk and performance risk based on our evaluation of the contract effort 
similarly  the eacs include identified opportunities for operating margin rate improvement 
over the contract period of performance  our program management organizations perform evaluations of contract performance and adjust the contract revenue and cost estimates to reflect the latest reliable information available 
our business and program management organizations are comprised of skilled professional managers whose objective is to satisfy the customer expectations  deliver high quality products and services  and manage contract risks and opportunities to achieve an appropriate operating margin rate on the contract 
our comprehensive business and contract management process is a coordinated process involving personnel with expertise from various disciplines including production control  contracts  cost management  mission assurance and quality  finance and supply chain  among others 
as part of this overall contract management function  these personnel monitor compliance with our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting and compliance with us government regulations 
contract operating income and period to period contract operating margin rates are adjusted over the contract period of performance to reflect the latest estimated revenue and cost for the contract  including changes in the risks and opportunities affecting the contract 
such adjustments may have a favorable or unfavorable effect on operating income depending upon the specific conditions affecting each contract 
in evaluating our operating performance  we look primarily at changes in sales and operating income  including the effects of meaningful changes in operating income as a result of changes in contract estimates 
where applicable  significant fluctuations in operating performance attributable to individual contracts or programs  or changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts are described in our analysis 
based on this approach and the nature of our operations  the discussion of results of operations first focuses around our four segments before distinguishing between products and services 
changes in sales are generally described in terms of volume  deliveries or other indicators of sales activity  and contract mix 
for purposes of this discussion  volume generally refers to increases or decreases in cost or sales from production service activity levels or delivery rates 
performance refers to changes in contract margin rates for the period  primarily related to the changes in estimates referred to above 
consolidated operating results selected financial highlights  excluding the results of discontinued operations  are presented in the table below year ended december in millions  except per share amounts sales operating costs and expenses operating income operating margin rate interest expense federal and foreign income tax expense effective income tax rate diluted earnings per share cash provided by continuing operations

we charge the costs of these plans to our contracts in accordance with the far and the related cost accounting standards cas that govern such plans 
the net fas cas pension adjustment is pension expense determined in accordance with gaap less pension expense charged to contracts and included in segment operating income 
unallocated corporate expenses generally include the portion of corporate expenses  other than fas pension costs  not considered allowable or allocable under applicable cas and far rules  and therefore not allocated to the segments  such as a portion of management and administration  legal  environmental  certain compensation and retiree benefits  and other expenses

table of contents northrop grumman corporation operating costs and expenses operating costs and expenses are primarily comprised of labor  material  subcontractor  and overhead costs  and are generally allocated to contracts as they are incurred 
in accordance with industry practice and the regulations that govern cost accounting requirements for government contracts  most general management and corporate expenses incurred at the segment and corporate locations are considered allowable and allocable costs 
these general and administrative costs are generally allocated on a systematic basis to contracts in progress 
operating costs and expenses consist of the following year ended december in millions product and service costs general and administrative operating costs and expenses product and service costs for decreased billion  or percent  as compared to the primary driver of the reduction in product and service costs was reduced volume at electronic systems  information systems and technical services 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total sales increased to percent in  from percent in  the increase includes the impact of lower sales  higher indirect costs related to compensation accruals and cost classification changes to standardize cost accounting practices at one of our segments  as well as higher bid and proposal expenses 
product and service costs for decreased billion  or percent  as compared to the primary driver of the reduction in product and service costs is reduced volume at all four of our segments  with aerospace systems  information systems and technical services driving the majority of the decrease 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total sales was comparable at percent 
for the product and service costs detail  see the product and service analysis section that follows 
operating income we define operating income as sales less operating costs and expenses  which includes general and administrative expenses 
changes in estimated sales  operating costs and expenses  and the resulting operating income related to our contracts accounted for using the percentage of completion method are recorded using the cumulative catch up method of accounting 
the aggregate effects of these favorable and unfavorable changes in our estimated costs at completion  across our portfolio of contracts  can have a significant effect upon our reported sales and operating income in each of our reporting periods 
cumulative catch up operating income adjustments are presented in the table below year ended december in millions favorable adjustments unfavorable adjustments net operating income adjustments cost reduction initiatives to increase our competitiveness contributed to the net favorable operating income adjustments 
our cost management activities have led to overall improved contract performance  reflected in both increased favorable adjustments and lower unfavorable adjustments

segment operating results basis of presentation we are aligned in four reportable segments aerospace systems  electronic systems  information systems and technical services 
this section discusses sales  segment operating income and operating margin rates by segment 
the reconciliation of segment sales to total sales is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item  with the difference being intersegment sales eliminations 
the reconciliation of segment operating income to total operating income  as well as a discussion of the reconciling items  is included in the consolidated operating results section above 
for purposes of the discussion in this segment operating results section  references to operating income and operating income margin rate reflect segment operating income and segment operating margin rate 
on january   we transferred our missile business primarily the intercontinental ballistic missile icbm program from the aerospace systems segment to our technical services segment 
the segment sales and segment operating income for the years ended december  and  have been recast to reflect the missile business transfer 
sales of million and million  and segment operating income of million and million  were transferred from aerospace systems to technical services for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for a more complete description of each segment s products and services  see the business descriptions in part i  item aerospace systems year ended december in millions sales operating income operating margin rate aerospace systems sales for were comparable to the prior year 
sales of unmanned systems increased approximately million  primarily related to ramping up on the nato alliance ground surveillance ags and fire scout programs 
additionally  there was higher volume of approximately million on the f program due to deliveries on lrip  the first f contract accounted for under the units of delivery method 
these increases were offset by the termination of a weather satellite program  which reduced sales by approximately million  as well as lower sales on the joint surveillance target attack radar system jstars  f a and certain restricted space programs 
operating income and margin rate for were comparable to the prior year 
the operating income and margin rate reflect approximately million lower operating income from the f a program lower volume and transition from the multi year contract to the lower margin multi year contract  principally offset by performance improvements in space systems and higher margin rates and volume on sales of unmanned systems 
aerospace systems sales for decreased million  or percent  as compared with the decrease was primarily due to approximately million lower sales in space systems due to reduced funding for weather satellite programs and the james webb space telescope jwst  as well as lower volume for several other space programs 
military aircraft systems declined approximately million primarily due to lower volume on the f program  which transitioned to a units of delivery revenue recognition method beginning with low rate initial production lot  the completion of the aerial targets program and lower volume on ea g growler  offset by higher volume on long endurance multi intelligence vehicle lemv and jstars 
these decreases were partially offset by higher sales at advanced concepts and technology  primarily due to increased volume on restricted programs 

table of contents northrop grumman corporation operating income for was comparable with the prior year  and operating margin rate increased to percent from percent 
the increase is primarily due to improved performance across several programs at aerospace systems and lower amortization expense on purchased intangibles  partially offset by an unfavorable adjustment for performance incentives on a space program and overall lower sales volume discussed above 
electronic systems year ended december in millions sales operating income operating margin rate electronic systems sales for decreased million  or percent  as compared with the decrease was largely due to lower volume of approximately million on infrared countermeasures sales and approximately million lower postal automation sales  including approximately million from our decision to de emphasize our domestic postal automation business 
these declines  as well as declines due to troop draw down and reduced overseas contingency operations funding  were partially offset by approximately million higher volume on space programs 
operating income for increased million  or percent  and operating margin rate increased to percent from percent 
the higher operating income and operating margin rate reflect approximately million of additional performance improvements over  primarily on several combat avionics programs 
these performance improvements include the effect of unfavorable adjustments of approximately million on a domestic postal automation program in the prior year that did not recur in electronic systems sales for decreased million  or percent  as compared with the decrease was primarily due to fewer deliveries on the large aircraft infrared countermeasures and vehicular intercommunications systems vis programs  offset by increased volume on restricted programs 
operating income for increased million  or percent  and operating margin rate increased to percent from percent 
the higher operating income is primarily due to performance improvements on several contracts nearing completion in land self protection systems and intelligence  surveillance reconnaissance programs 
the improved program performance was partially offset by reserves established in for reductions in workforce and a reserve on a program related to outstanding contractual issues as the contract nears completion and the overall lower sales volume described above 
information systems year ended december in millions sales operating income operating margin rate information systems sales for decreased million  or percent  as compared with  with no single program driving a significant portion 
the decline in sales reflects the termination or wind down on a number of programs  including the joint tactical radio systems airborne  maritime and fixed jtrs amf  installation kits i kits  enterprise network management enm and f programs  partially offset by higher volume of approximately million on the encore ii information technology support program  as well as higher volume on the air and space operations center  enterprise system development  and ground combat vehicle programs 
further reducing sales was lower volume on restricted programs  as well as the sale of the county of san diego it outsourcing contract and the sale of park air norway  which together reduced sales by approximately million  as compared to operating income for decreased million  or percent  and operating margin rate increased to percent from percent 
the higher operating margin rate is primarily driven by performance improvements across a number of contracts  which largely offset the impact of lower volume on operating income 
information systems sales for decreased million  or percent  as compared with the largest driver was lower sales for defense programs of million  principally attributed to reduced volume on force 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation protection security system  saudi arabian american oil company  netcents dko  f and several other programs  partially offset by higher volume on encore ii and trailer mounted support system programs 
the lower civil sales volume is primarily due to the sale of the county of san diego contract  which reduced sales by million as compared to the same period in  lower volume on the enm program and completion of the treasury communications system program in operating income for increased million  or percent  and operating margin rate increased to percent from percent 
the increase is primarily driven by improved performance on several civil programs  including the virginia information technologies agency outsource contract and the effect of the sale of the county of san diego contract  partially offset by the lower sales volume in defense programs described above 
technical services year ended december in millions sales operating income operating margin rate technical services sales for decreased million  or percent  as compared with the decrease was primarily due to reduced volume from portfolio shaping of approximately million as we focus our operations into core areas  lower kc logistics activity of approximately million and lower icbm logistics and modernization activity of approximately million 
operating income for increased million  or percent  and operating margin rate increased to percent from percent 
the higher operating income and operating margin rate were primarily due to improved performance on the kc program  partially offset by lower sales volume as described above 
technical services sales for decreased million  or percent  as compared with the decrease is primarily due to million lower sales in defense and government systems  primarily due to the reduced participation in the nstec joint venture 
effective january   the company reduced its participation in this joint venture and deconsolidated it  resulting in no sales recorded for the joint venture for  compared with sales of million in the decrease was partially offset by increased activity on the kc program  which began in february operating income for increased million  or percent  and operating margin rate increased to percent from percent 
the increase in operating margin rate is primarily due to effects of the change in participation in the nstec joint venture and performance improvements on several logistics and modernization and defense programs  partially offset by unfavorable program performance on kc product and service analysis year ended december in millions product sales product costs of product sales service sales service costs of service sales product and service costs do not include an allocation of general and administrative expenses 
product costs as a percentage of product sales decreased basis points for the year ended december   compared to this improvement reflects higher margins on combat avionics at electronic systems 
service costs as a percentage of service sales decreased basis points for the year ended december   compared to this improvement reflects higher service margins in all four business segments 
the

product sales and product costs product sales in decreased by million  compared to  primarily due to lower product sales at electronic systems and technical services  partially offset by higher product sales at information systems 
the decrease at electronic systems primarily relates to lower volume of approximately million in combat avionics and approximately million in domestic and international postal automation programs 
the decline at technical services was due to the change in classification of the icbm program from product to service at the beginning of  as the program transitioned from modernization to predominantly sustainment services 
the increase at information systems was primarily driven by higher intercompany volume 
product costs in decreased by million  compared to  primarily due to lower sales volume and increased performance improvement adjustments at electronic systems and the change in classification of the icbm program at technical services  offset by higher product volume at information systems  as described above 
product sales in decreased billion  compared to  primarily due to lower sales volume on space and military aircraft programs at aerospace systems and lower sales volume in land and self protection systems at electronic systems

service costs in decreased million  due to lower sales at information systems  partially offset by the transitioning of the icbm program from product to service at technical services  as described above  and higher service volume at electronic systems 
the service activities at aerospace systems and electronic systems were at higher margin than the prior year  resulting in service costs decreasing more than service sales 
service sales in decreased million  compared to  primarily due to the reduced participation by technical services in the nstec joint venture  resulting in no sales recorded for the joint venture in  compared to million in  and lower sales volume on defense and civil programs at information systems 
service costs in decreased million  due to the overall decline in sales for the period and margin rate improvements at information systems  technical services and electronic systems  offset somewhat by an unfavorable margin rate change at aerospace systems 
contributing to the overall decline in revenues was the company reduced participation in the nstec joint venture  which resulted in the deconsolidation of this business in nstec contributed revenues of million and segment cost of sales of million in when it was included in technical service sales  thus driving a basis point improvement in margin rate for this segment 
more modest margin rate improvements at electronic systems and information systems effectively offset the decline in margin rate at the aerospace systems business

liquidity and capital resources we endeavor to ensure the most efficient conversion of operating earnings into cash for deployment in our business and to maximize shareholder value 
in addition to our cash position  we use various financial measures to assist in capital deployment decision making  including  but not limited to  net cash provided by operations  free cash flow  net debt to equity and debt to capital 
we believe these measures are useful to investors in assessing our financial performance and condition 
cash balances and cash generated from continuing operations  supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities and or in the capital markets  if needed  is expected to be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
as of december   the amount of cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities held outside of the us by foreign subsidiaries was million 
we do not anticipate repatriating these balances to fund domestic operations 
capital expenditure commitments at december   of approximately million are expected to be paid with cash on hand 
the table below summarizes key components of cash flow provided by operating activities from continuing operations year ended december in millions net earnings net earnings from discontinued operations charge on debt redemption non cash items retiree benefit funding in excess of expense trade working capital change cash provided by continuing operations includes depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation expense and deferred income taxes 
free cash flow from continuing operations free cash flow from continuing operations is defined as cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures 
we believe free cash flow from continuing operations is a useful measure for investors to consider as it represents the cash flow the company has available after capital spending to invest for future growth  strengthen the balance sheet and or return to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases 
free cash flow is a key factor in our planning for and consideration of strategic acquisitions  the payment of dividends and stock repurchases 
free cash flow from continuing operations is not a measure of financial performance under gaap  and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner 
this measure should not be considered in isolation  as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes  or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with gaap as indicators of performance

in september  the company entered into a new day revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of million  replacing the previous million day revolving credit facility 
the credit agreements contain covenants which restrict the company s ability to sell all or substantially all of its assets  merge or consolidate with another entity or undertake other fundamental changes and incur liens 
the company also cannot permit the ratio of its consolidated debt to capitalization as set forth in the credit agreements to exceed percent 
the company is in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreements

other sources and uses of capital additional capital we believe we can obtain additional capital  if necessary for long term liquidity  from such sources as the public or private capital markets  the sale of assets  sale and leaseback of operating assets  and leasing rather than purchasing new assets 
we have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the sec  which allows us to access capital in a timely manner 
financial arrangements in the ordinary course of business  the company uses standby letters of credit and guarantees issued by commercial banks and surety bonds issued principally by insurance companies to guarantee the performance on certain obligations

table of contents northrop grumman corporation contractual obligations the following table presents our contractual obligations as of december   and the estimated timing of future cash payments in millions total and beyond long term debt interest payments on long term debt operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum  or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
these amounts are primarily comprised of open purchase order commitments to vendors and subcontractors pertaining to funded contracts 
other long term liabilities primarily consist of total accrued environmental reserves  deferred compensation  and other miscellaneous liabilities  of which million is related to environmental reserves recorded in other current liabilities 
it excludes obligations for uncertain tax positions of million  as the timing of such payments  if any  cannot be reasonably estimated 
further details regarding long term debt and operating leases can be found in notes and  respectively  to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item critical accounting policies  estimates  and judgments revenue recognition overview we derive the majority of our business from long term contracts for development  production and support activities for the us government 
these contracts are accounted for in conformity with gaap for construction type and production type contracts and federal government contractors  generally using the percentage of completion method accounting 
we classify contract revenues as product or service depending on the predominant attributes of the contract 
we consider the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when determining the proper accounting method for a particular contract 
percentage of completion accounting the use of the percentage of completion method requires us to make reasonably dependable estimates for the design  manufacture  and delivery of our products and services 
we generally recognize revenues from our long term contracts under the cost to cost or the units of delivery measures of the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the percentage of completion method recognizes revenue as work on a contract progresses 
most of our contracts use the cost to cost method  where revenue is calculated based on the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs at completion of the contract 
the units of delivery measure recognizes revenues as deliveries are made to the customer  generally using unit sales values 
under both of these methods of percentage of completion accounting  we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract at completion  and recognize that profit as costs are incurred or as units are delivered 
certain contracts contain provisions for price redetermination or for cost and or performance incentives 
these amounts are included in sales when they are reasonably estimable 
amounts representing un priced change orders  claims  requests for equitable adjustment  or recovery of costs in excess of limitations in funding are included in estimated contract revenue only when they are reliably estimable and realization is probable 
changes in estimates of contract revenues  costs  or profits are recognized using the cumulative catch up method of accounting 
this method recognizes  in the current period  the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods 
revenue and profit on future periods of contract performance are recognized as if the revised estimate had been used since contract inception 
if it is determined that a loss will result from the performance of a contract  the entire amount of the estimable future loss is charged against income in the period the loss is identified 
loss provisions are first offset against costs that are included in unbilled accounts receivable or inventoried costs  and any remaining amount is reflected in liabilities 

table of contents northrop grumman corporation changes in contract estimates occur for a variety of reasons  including changes in contract scope  changes in estimated revenue  and changes in contract cost estimates 
these changes are often driven by events such as changes in estimated incentive fees  unanticipated risks affecting contract costs  the resolution of risk at lower or higher cost than anticipated  and changes in indirect cost allocations  such as overhead and general and administrative expenses 
we employ an extensive contract management process involving several functional organizations and numerous personnel who are skilled at managing contract activities 
changes in estimates are frequent  the company performs on a broad portfolio of long term contracts  many of which include complex and customized aerospace and electronic equipment and software  that often includes technology at the forefront of science 
significant changes in estimates on a single contract could have a material effect on the company consolidated financial position or annual results of operations  and where such changes occur  separate disclosure is made of the nature  underlying conditions and financial impact of the change 
for the impacts of changes in estimates on our consolidated statement of earnings  see the consolidating operating results section above and note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item cost estimation the cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge of our engineers  program managers and financial professionals  and draws on their significant experience and judgment 
such costs are typically incurred over a period of several years  and estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment 
factors that are considered in estimating the cost of the work to be completed include the availability  productivity and cost of labor  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the effect of change orders  the availability and cost of materials  the effect of any delays in performance  and the level of indirect cost allocations 
we update our contract estimates at least annually and more frequently as determined by the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances 
we generally review and reassess our cost and revenue estimates for each significant contract on a quarterly basis 
goodwill overview we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values  with the excess recorded as goodwill 
such fair value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time  which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates 
adjustments to the fair value of purchased assets and liabilities after the initial measurement period are recognized in net earnings 
impairment testing we perform an annual impairment test of our goodwill as of november th  or between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that suggest goodwill should be evaluated 
when testing goodwill  we compare the fair value of each of our four reporting units to their carrying values 
to determine the fair value of our reporting units  we primarily use the income approach based on the cash flows that the reporting unit expects to generate in the future  consistent with our operating plans 
this income valuation method requires management to project revenues  operating expenses  working capital  capital spending and cash flows for the reporting units over a multi year period  as well as determine the weighted average cost of capital wacc used as a discount rate and terminal value assumptions 
the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longer term contracts and barriers to market entry 
the terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model 
impairment assessment inherently involves management judgments as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions 
due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill  differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis 
we also corroborate the fair values determined under the income approach using the market valuation method to estimate the fair value of our reporting units  by utilizing industry multiples including relevant control premiums of operating earnings 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit s individual assets and liabilities and calculate the implied fair value of goodwill 
the results of our annual goodwill impairment test as of november   indicated that the estimated fair value of our reporting units exceed their carrying value 
there were no impairment charges recorded in the years ended december   and fair values for three of our four reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values as of our annual impairment testing on november  at our other reporting unit  information systems  fair value exceeds carrying value by approximately five percent 
information systems carrying value includes goodwill of 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation billion as of december  we face continued uncertainty in our business environment due to the substantial fiscal and economic challenges facing the us government  our primary customer 
unresolved issues arising from these challenges include potential sequestration and action on the national debt ceiling 
potential contract cancellations or terminations may arise from resolution of these issues and could cause our revenues  profits and cash flows to be lower than our current projections 
in addition  market based inputs to the calculations in the impairment test  such as weighted average cost of capital and terminal value based on market comparisons could also be negatively impacted 
such circumstances may result in an impairment of our goodwill 
further  the carrying values of our reporting units are significantly influenced by a number of factors including the discount rate used to determine our net pension liability 
therefore  an increase in the discount rate on our pension liability in or beyond could result in an impairment of goodwill absent any changes discussed above 
retirement benefits overview for financial statement purposes  we account for our employee pension and other post retirement plans in accordance with gaap under fas 
we charge the costs of these plans to our contracts with customers in accordance with the far and the related cas that govern such plans 
in measuring periodic pension cost  both fas and cas recognize a normal service cost component  but there are differences in the way the remaining components of annual pension costs are calculated under each method  including the assumptions and methods used for measuring the plan obligations 
as a result  retiree benefit plan expense amounts for fas are different from the amounts for cas 
further  differences result from dissimilar methodologies as to how estimated earnings on pension assets and interest expense on the pension obligations are measured  and the periods over which gains losses related to pension assets and actuarial changes are amortized 
cas pension expense is charged to contracts and included in segment operating income  and the difference between the cas and fas pension expense is recorded in operating income at the consolidated company level 
for fas purposes  we perform an annual review of the assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for our pension plans and other post retirement benefit plans in consultation with our outside actuaries 
in the event that we determine changes in the assumptions are warranted  or as a result of plan amendments  future fas pension and post retirement benefit expense could increase or decrease 
the principal assumptions that have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations are the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the health care cost trend rate and the estimated fair market value of plan assets 
discount rate the discount rate represents the interest rate that is used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and other post retirement benefit obligations 
the discount rate is generally based on the yield of high quality corporate fixed income investments 
at the end of each year  the discount rate is determined using a portfolio of high quality bonds matching the notional cash outflows related to benefit payments for each significant benefit plan 
taking into consideration the factors noted above  our weighted average pension composite discount rate was percent at december   and percent at december  the effects of hypothetical changes in the discount rate for a single year may not be representative and may be asymmetrical or nonlinear for future years because of the application of the accounting corridor 
the accounting corridor is a defined range within which amortization of net gains and losses is not required 
holding all other assumptions constant  and since net actuarial gains and losses were in excess of the percent accounting corridor in  an increase or decrease of basis points in the discount rate assumption for would have the following estimated effect to increase decrease in millions basis point decrease in discount rate basis point increase in discount rate pension expense post retirement benefit expense pension obligation post retirement benefit obligation expected long term rate of return the expected long term rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of earnings expected on funds invested 
for and  we assumed an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of percent and percent  respectively 
for pension and post retirement benefit plan purposes  we have assumed an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of percent and percent  
table of contents northrop grumman corporation respectively 
holding all other assumptions constant  an increase or decrease of basis points in the expected long term rate of return assumption for would have the following estimated effect to in millions basis point decrease basis point increase pension expense post retirement benefit expense health care cost trend rate the health care cost trend rate represents the annual rate of change in the cost of health care benefits based on external estimates of health care inflation  changes in health care utilization or delivery patterns  technological advances  and changes in the health status of the plan participants 
for the years ended december  and december   we used a combination of market expectations and economic projections  including the effect of health care reform  to select an expected initial health care cost trend rate of percent for and percent for  respectively 
additionally  we expect an ultimate health care cost trend rate of percent to be reached in for both and although our actual cost experience is much lower at this time  market conditions and the potential effects of health care reform are expected to increase medical cost trends in the next one to three years  thus our past experience may not reflect future conditions 
a one percentage point change in the initial through the ultimate health care cost trend rates within the range would have had the following estimated effect on post retirement benefit results in millions percentage point decrease percentage point increase post retirement benefit expense post retirement benefit liability estimated fair market value of plan assets for certain plan assets where the fair market value is not readily determinable  such as real estate  private equity and hedge funds  estimates of fair value are determined using the best information available 
litigation  commitments  and contingencies we are subject to a range of claims  investigations  lawsuits  environmental matters  income tax matters  and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment based upon the professional knowledge and experience of management and counsel 
we determine whether to record a charge to earnings and  if so  what amount based on consideration of the facts and circumstances of each matter as then known to us  including any settlement offers  and our assessment of the probability of the liabilities and whether the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
when we believe  based on the facts available to us  that a liability is probable and the loss is reasonably estimable  we record our best estimate of the amount of the ultimate loss 
when a range of costs is reasonably estimable  but no amount within that range is a better estimate than another  we record what we estimate as the lower end of the range 
determinations whether to record a charge and  if so  of what amount  reflect management assessment regarding what is likely to occur  they do not necessarily reflect what management believes should occur 
the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to us may vary materially from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances develop or become known to us 
for further information on the treatment of these contingencies  see note  note and note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item environmental accruals we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we conduct operations 
factors that could result in changes to the assessment of probability  range of estimated costs  and environmental accruals include modification of planned remedial actions  increase or decrease in the estimated time required to remediate  discovery of more or less extensive contamination than anticipated  results of efforts to involve other responsible parties  financial capabilities of other responsible parties  changes in laws and regulations or contractual obligations affecting remediation requirements or other obligations  and improvements in remediation technology
