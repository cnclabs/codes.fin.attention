item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management overview highlights of operating results edison international is the parent holding company of sce 
sce is an investor owned public utility primarily engaged in the business of supplying electricity 
edison international is also the parent company of subsidiaries that are engaged in competitive businesses related to the delivery or use of electricity 
such competitive business activities are currently not material to report as a separate business segment 
references to edison international refer to the consolidated group of edison international and its subsidiaries

management uses core earnings internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance 
core earnings losses are also used when communicating with investors and analysts regarding edison international earnings results to facilitate comparisons of the company performance from period to period 
core earnings losses are a non gaap financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies 
core earnings losses are defined as earnings attributable to edison international shareholders less income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings  such as exit activities  including lease terminations  sale of certain assets  early debt extinguishment costs and other activities that are no longer continuing  asset impairments and certain tax  regulatory or legal settlements or proceedings 
on december   eme and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of the us bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court for the northern district of illinois  eastern division 
edison international considers eme to be an abandoned asset under generally accepted accounting principles  and  as a result  the operations of eme prior to december  and for all prior years  are reflected as discontinued operations 
sce core earnings increased million for the year primarily due to rate base growth and lower income taxes which reflect the implementation of the cpuc general rate case grc decision 
sce also incurred incremental inspection and repair costs related to the outages at san onofre of million  net of sce share of amounts received from mitsubishi heavy industries  inc mhi  and million in severance costs 
severance costs are related to employee reductions at san onofre  as planned in the grc  and approved employee reductions for as sce works to optimize its cost structure and to minimize impacts on customer rates 
these costs were partially offset by other operations and maintenance cost reductions 
edison international parent and other core losses increased million as a result of income tax benefits in core losses in also reflect higher income taxes  a write down of an investment and higher operating expenses and interest costs 
consolidated non core items for and for edison international included an after tax earnings charge of billion during the fourth quarter of due to the full impairment of the investment in eme as a result of the deconsolidation of eme  recognition of losses previously deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income  a provision for losses from the eme bankruptcy and tax impacts related to the expected future tax deconsolidation and separation of eme from edison international

see results of operations for discussion of sce and edison international parent and other results of operations  including a comparison of results to cpuc general rate case in november  the cpuc approved a final decision in sce grc  authorizing a base rate revenue requirement of approximately billion 
the decision results in an increase of approximately million  excluding revenue related to nuclear refueling outages  over currently authorized revenue 
the decision approves san onofre costs subject to refund and reasonableness review and includes a requirement to track those costs in a memorandum account 
see san onofre outage  inspection and repair issues below for further information 
in addition  sce proposed ratemaking treatment of repair deductions for income taxes was reflected in the revenue requirement adopted in the decision 
see item notes to consolidated financial statements note income taxes for further discussion 
the decision allows a ratemaking methodology that escalates capital additions by for and for the decision also allows operations and maintenance expense to be escalated for and through the use of various annual escalation factors for labor  non labor and medical expenses 
the methodology adopted in the decision and the escalation factors results in a revenue requirement of approximately billion 
sce estimates that the revenue requirement would be approximately billion using the decision methodology  estimated escalation factors and the reduction in the cost of capital discussed below 
san onofre outage  inspection and repair issues two replacement steam generators were installed at san onofre in each of units and in and  respectively 
in the first quarter of  a water leak suddenly occurred in one of the heat transfer tubes in san onofre unit steam generators and the unit was safely taken off line 
at the time  unit was off line for a planned outage when areas of unexpected tube to support structure wear were found 
both units have remained off line for extensive inspections  testing and analysis of their steam generators 
each unit will be restarted only when and if sce determines that it is safe to do so and when start up has been approved by the nrc pursuant to the terms of a confirmatory action letter cal issued by the nrc in march tube leak and repairs the unit steam generator water leak was caused by unexpected excessive wear resulting from tube to tube contact in the area of the leak 
unit s steam generators were re inspected using a more sensitive inspection method than had previously been employed  and similar wear from tube to tube contact was found on two tubes in one of the steam generators at wear levels below the detection capability of initial inspections 
in contrast  unit experienced extensive tube to tube wear in a number of tubes 
both unit and unit also had tube to support structure wear 
as a result of these findings  sce has plugged and removed from service all tubes showing excessive wear in each of the steam generators 
in addition  sce preventively plugged all tubes in contact with retainer bars or in the area of the tube bundles where tube to tube contact occurred 
each steam generator has over  heat transfer tubes and is designed to include sufficient tubes to accommodate removal of some tubes from service for a variety of reasons  and the tubes that have been removed from service are within this margin 
a team of outside experts was assembled to assist sce and mhi  the manufacturer of the steam generators  to analyze the causes of the tube to tube wear and potential remedial actions 
as a result of their work  sce understands that the tube to tube contact arises from excessive vibration of the tubes in certain areas of the steam generators 
the excessive vibration that caused the tube to tube wear in unit resulted from a phenomenon called fluid elastic instability 
this phenomenon arises from a combination of thermal hydraulic conditions steam velocity and moisture content of the steam  and ineffectiveness of the tube supports in the areas where the vibration occurs 
unit is susceptible to the same thermal hydraulic conditions as unit  but the unit tube supports largely remained effective for the entire time that it operated as compared to unit sce unit restart plans and its response to the cal are based on work done by engineering groups of three independent firms with expertise in steam generator design and manufacturing 
restart plans were submitted only for unit because it did not experience the extensive tube to tube wear that unit did 
using different methodologies  each independent outside engineering group agreed that it would be safe to restart unit and operate at a reduced power level for approximately five months  followed by a mid cycle scheduled outage and inspection 
in addition to these requirements  the restart plan covers repairs  corrective actions and operating parameters and also includes additional monitoring  detection and response activities 
inasmuch as unit had much more tube to tube wear than unit  it remains unclear whether unit will be able to restart without additional repairs and corrective actions 
the ability to restart unit may also be affected by the operating experience of unit each unit will only be restarted when any necessary repairs and appropriate mitigation plans for that unit are completed in accordance with the cal  and the nrc and sce are satisfied that it is safe to do so 
sce has also been engaged in the analysis of what repairs  if any  could be undertaken to restore the steam generators on both units to their originally specified capabilities safely  and has been advised by mhi that a possible course of action would be replacement of significant portions of the steam generators  a process that could take more than five years 
nrc processes the cal requires nrc permission to restart unit and unit and outlines actions sce must complete before permission to restart either unit may be sought 
in october  sce submitted to the nrc a response to the cal and restart plans for unit the timing of restart of the units will be affected by the nature of and schedule for regulatory processes required by the nrc 
there is no set or predetermined time period for approval of unit s proposed restart  and  accordingly  there can be no assurance about the length of time the nrc may take to review sce request to restart or whether any such request will be granted in whole or in part 
it is also possible that one or more amendments to the nrc operating license for san onofre might be required whether or not as a prerequisite to return a unit to safe operation 
the nrc has been engaged in conducting a series of inspections  evaluations  reviews and public meetings about the causes of the steam generator malfunction and damage and to verify that sce has performed the actions described in the cal response and as otherwise required by its obligations as a nuclear operator 
this process has included inspections and review by an nrc appointed augmented inspection team 
sce has been advised that the nrc office of investigations has initiated an investigation into the accuracy and completeness of information sce has provided to the nrc regarding the san onofre steam generators 
should the nrc find a deficiency in sce performance or provision of information  sce could be subject to additional nrc actions  including the imposition of penalties  and the findings could be taken into consideration in the cpuc regulatory proceedings described below 
cpuc review under california public utilities code section  sce is required to notify the cpuc if either of the san onofre units has been out of service for nine consecutive months not including preplanned outages 
sce provided such notice to the cpuc on november  for unit and december  for unit the cpuc is required within days of sce notice for a particular unit to initiate an investigation to determine whether to remove from customer rates some or the entire revenue requirement associated with the portion of the facility that is out of service 
from the initiation date of the investigation  such rates are collected subject to refund 
under section  any determination to adjust rates is made after hearings are conducted in connection with the utility next general rate case 
if  after investigation and hearings  the costs associated with a unit are disallowed recovery because it is out of service and the unit is subsequently returned to service  rates may be readjusted to reflect that return to service after continuous hours of operation 
in october  in advance of sce required notification under section  the cpuc issued an order instituting investigation that consolidates all san onofre issues in related regulatory proceedings and considers appropriate cost recovery for all san onofre costs  including among other costs  the cost of the steam generator replacement project  substitute market power costs  capital expenditures  operations and maintenance costs  and seismic study costs 
the order requires that all san onofre related costs incurred on and after january  be tracked in a memorandum account and  to the extent included in rates  collected subject to refund 
the order also states that the cpuc will determine whether to order the immediate removal  effective as of the date of the order  of all costs related to san onofre from sce rates  with placement of those costs in a deferred debit account pending the return of one or both units to useful service  or other possible action 
it is currently expected that the investigation will be conducted in phases that will extend at least into in parallel with the order instituting investigation  the grc final decision requires sce to track san onofre related costs in a memorandum account subject to refund  beginning january  sce filed an application in january seeking a reasonableness determination regarding these costs 
that application has been consolidated with the order instituting investigation proceeding 
contractual matters the steam generators were designed and supplied by mhi and are warranted for an initial period of years from acceptance 
mhi is contractually obligated to repair or replace defective items and to pay specified damages for certain repairs 
sce purchase contract with mhi states that mhi liability under the purchase agreement is limited to million and excludes consequential damages  defined to include the cost of replacement power 
such limitations in the contract are subject to applicable exceptions both in the contract and under law 
sce has notified mhi that it believes one or more of such exceptions now apply and that mhi liability is not limited to million  and mhi has advised sce that it disagrees 
the disagreement may ultimately become subject to dispute resolution procedures set forth in the purchase agreement  including international arbitration 
sce  on behalf of itself and the other san onofre co owners  has submitted three invoices to mhi totaling million for steam generator repair costs incurred through october  mhi paid the first invoice of million  while reserving its right to challenge any of the charges in the invoice 
in january  mhi advised sce that it rejected a portion of the first invoice and required further documentation regarding the remainder of the invoice 
sce has recorded its share of the invoice paid as a reduction of repair and inspection costs 
san onofre carries both property damage and outage insurance issued by nuclear electric insurance limited neil and has placed neil on notice of potential claims for loss recovery 
the property damage policy including excess coverage provides insurance for certain costs and expenses resulting from accidental property damage with a million deductible and a billion limit of liability 
after a twelve week deductible period  the outage policy provides insurance for an outage caused by accidental property damage of up to million per week for each unit or million per unit per week if both units are out because of the same accident  with a million limit for each unit million each if both units are out because of the same accident 
the neil policies have a number of exclusions and limitations that may reduce or eliminate coverage 
in october  sce filed separate proofs of loss for unit and unit under the outage policy 
pursuant to these proofs of loss sce is seeking the weekly indemnity amounts provided under the policy for each unit 
because the outage is ongoing  sce will supplement these proofs of loss in the future 
no amounts have been recognized in sce financial statements  pending neil response 
to the extent any costs are recovered under the outage policy  sce expects to refund those amounts to ratepayers through the erra balancing account 
for further information  see item notes to consolidated financial statements note commitments and contingencies 
financial summary a summary of financial items related to songs is as follows the costs tracked in the memorandum account under the cpuc order instituting investigation include million of sce authorized revenue requirement associated with operating and maintenance expenses  and depreciation and return on sce investment in unit  unit and common plant 
this amount is subject to refund depending on the outcome of the investigation 
at december   sce rate base and net investment associated with san onofre are set forth in the following table in millions unit unit common plant total net investment net plant in service materials and supplies construction work in progress nuclear fuel net investment tax basis rate base net plant in service materials and supplies accumulated deferred income taxes amounts in rate base in addition  sce has contracted to purchase nuclear fuel 
see liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations and contingencies below 
in  the cpuc authorized expenditures of approximately million million based on sce estimate after adjustment for inflation using the handy whitman index for sce share of the costs to purchase and install the four new steam generators in units and and remove and dispose of their predecessors 
sce has spent million through december  on the steam generator replacement project 
these expenditures are included in the table above and remain subject to cpuc reasonableness review and approval 
as a result of outages associated with the steam generator inspection and repair  electric power and capacity normally provided by san onofre are being purchased in the market by sce commencing on february for unit and march for unit 
market power costs through december  were approximately million  net of avoided nuclear fuel costs  and are typically recoverable through the erra balancing account subject to cpuc reasonableness review  which will now take place as part of the cpuc order instituting investigation proceeding 
future market power costs cannot be estimated at this time due to uncertainties associated with when and at what output levels the units will or may be returned to service  however  such amounts may be material 
through december  sce share of incremental inspection and repair costs totaled million for both units not including payments made by mhi as described below  and repairs to restart unit at the reduced power levels described above were completed 
the costs for unit may increase following nrc review under the cal 
total incremental repair costs associated with returning unit to service  and returning both units to service at originally specified capabilities safely  remain uncertain 
sce recorded its share of payments made to date by mhi million as a reduction of incremental inspection and repair costs 
sce believes that the actions taken and costs incurred in connection with the san onofre replacement steam generators and outages have been prudent 
accordingly  sce considers its operating  capital  and market power costs  recoverable through base rates and the erra balancing account  as offset by third party recoveries where applicable 
sce cannot provide assurance that either or both units of san onofre will be returned to service  that the cpuc will not disallow costs incurred or order refunds to customers of amounts collected in rates  or that sce will be successful in recovering amounts from third parties 
a delay in the restart of san onofre unit beyond this summer may impact plans for future operations of both units 
disallowances of costs and or refund of amounts received from customers could be material and adversely affect sce financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
cost of capital application in june  the cpuc issued an order in the cost of capital proceeding consolidating sce application with the three other california investor owned utilities applications and splitting the proceeding into two phases 
the first phase addressed the ratemaking capital structure and cost of capital for the utilities 
the second phase considers whether the current cost of capital adjustment mechanism should be continued or modified 
in december  the cpuc issued a final decision in the ratemaking capital structure and cost of capital phase of sce cost of capital proceeding granting sce requested ratemaking capital structure of long term debt  preferred equity and common equity 
the decision adopted a return on common equity of and adopted long term debt and preferred stock costs of and  respectively 
sce has implemented the impacts of the decision in rates  effective january  in february  a proposed decision was issued in the second phase of the proceeding that provides for sce adjustment mechanism to continue for and the proposed decision also provides for the mechanism to automatically readjust sce s capital costs if certain thresholds are reached on an annual basis 
a final decision for the second phase is expected in march capital program total capital expenditures including accruals were billion in both and due to the delay in the grc decision  the level of capital expenditures in was lower than anticipated 
sce capital program for is focused primarily in the following areas maintaining reliability and expanding the capability of sce transmission and distribution system 
upgrading and constructing new transmission lines and substations for system reliability and increased access to renewable energy  including the tehachapi  devers colorado river  eldorado ivanpah  and red bluff transmission and substation projects 
maintaining performance of sce natural gas  nuclear and hydro electric generating plants 
sce forecasts capital expenditures in the range of billion to billion for actual capital spending will be affected by changes in regulatory  environmental and engineering design requirements  permitting and project delays  cost and availability of labor  equipment and materials  and other factors as discussed further under sce liquidity and capital resources capital investment plan 
sce continues to experience cost pressures on its tehachapi and devers colorado river transmission projects  primarily related to environmental monitoring and mitigation costs  scope changes and schedule delays 
the tehachapi transmission project has experienced further permitting and schedule delays 
the project may be further impacted by cpuc proceedings to reexamine construction options  including possibly undergrounding lines  for a portion of the project and by issues related to aviation marking and lighting and community opposition to portions of the line  as further discussed in sce liquidity and capital resources capital investment plan 
eme chapter bankruptcy filing during  eme continued to experience operating losses due to low realized energy and capacity prices  high fuel costs and low generation at the midwest generation plants 
forward market prices indicate that these trends are expected to continue for a number of years 
a continuation of these adverse trends coupled with pending debt maturities and the need to retrofit its midwest generation plants to comply with governmental regulations  ultimately caused eme and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries to file voluntary petitions on the petition date for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code in the bankruptcy court 
on december   edison international  eme and certain of eme senior unsecured noteholders entered into support agreement  that  subject to further documentation  bankruptcy court approval and certain other conditions  provides that edison international will cease to own eme when eme emerges from bankruptcy pursuant to a plan of reorganization 
the tax allocation agreements with respect to eme will be extended through the earlier of the effective date of a plan of reorganization or december   and eme will remain bound to perform its obligations under such agreements 
edison international and eme will continue to provide ongoing shared services to each other in the ordinary course  consistent with the same terms and conditions on which those services have been provided in the past 
upon effectiveness of eme plan of reorganization  edison international will assume certain of eme employee retirement related liabilities 
edison international  eme and the noteholders who have signed the support agreement will exchange releases of claims  and eme and edison international will cross indemnify one another against liabilities arising from the conduct of their separate businesses 
under the support agreement  within days following the petition date  eme will seek authority from the bankruptcy court to enter into the settlement transaction  which must be obtained within days following the petition date or the support agreement is subject to termination 
there can be no assurance that the bankruptcy court will approve the settlement transaction  and even if it is approved  there can be no assurance that the conditions to the effectiveness of the settlement transaction will be satisfied 
in addition  eme is entitled to terminate the support agreement and consider alternative transactions in accordance with its fiduciary duties 
in anticipation of eme chapter filing  edison international representatives  who previously served on the eme board of directors  resigned 
eme and those subsidiaries in chapter proceedings retain control of their assets and are authorized to operate their businesses as debtors in possession while being subject to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the bankruptcy code and orders of the bankruptcy court 
edison international no longer retains significant influence over the ongoing operations of eme 
edison international anticipates that the bankruptcy court will approve a plan of reorganization in which edison international ceases to have any ownership interest as provided in the support agreement 
as a result of the bankruptcy filing  edison international no longer consolidates the earnings and losses of eme or its subsidiaries effective december  and has reflected its ownership interest in eme utilizing the cost method of accounting prospectively  under which edison international investment in eme is reflected as a single amount on the consolidated balance sheet of edison international at december  furthermore  edison international has recorded a full impairment of the investment in eme as a result of the deconsolidation of eme  recognition of losses previously deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income  a provision for losses from the eme bankruptcy and estimated tax impacts related to the expected future tax deconsolidation and separation of eme from edison international 
the aggregate impact of these matters resulted in an after tax charge of billion during the fourth quarter of in addition  for the reasons described above  edison international considers eme to be an abandoned asset under generally accepted accounting principles  and  as a result  the operations of eme prior to december  and for all prior years  are reflected as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements 
see item notes to consolidated financial statements note discontinued operations for additional information related to these bankruptcy proceedings 
results of operations sce sce results of operations are derived mainly through two sources utility earning activities representing revenue authorized by the cpuc and ferc which is intended to provide sce a reasonable opportunity to recover its costs and earn a return on its net investment in generation  transmission and distribution assets 
the annual revenue requirements are comprised of authorized operation and maintenance costs  depreciation  taxes and a return consistent with the capital structure 
also  included in utility earnings activities are revenues or penalties related to incentive mechanisms  other operating revenue  and regulatory charges or disallowances  if any 
utility cost recovery activities representing cpuc and ferc authorized balancing accounts which allow for recovery of specific project or program costs  subject to reasonableness review or compliance with upfront standards 
utility cost recovery activities include rates which provide recovery  subject to reasonableness review of  among other things  fuel costs  purchased power costs  public purpose related program costs including energy efficiency and demand side management programs  certain operation and maintenance expenses and nuclear decommissioning expenses 
the following tables summarize sce results of operations for the periods indicated 
the presentation below separately identifies utility earning activities and utility cost recovery activities 
beginning in  sce classified revenues and costs related to programs that provide for recovery of actual costs plus a return on capital as utility earning activities 
previously  sce classified the recovery of actual costs incurred under these programs as utility cost recovery activities

utility earning activities vs utility earning activities were primarily affected by the following higher operating revenue was primarily due to the following million increase in revenue related to the implementation of the grc decision 
the decision authorized a revenue requirement increase of approximately million over the authorized revenue  excluding nuclear refueling outages million of which is reflected in utility cost recovery activities primarily related to employee benefits  and million increase in revenue related to authorized cpuc projects not included in sce grc authorized revenue  including the edisonsmartconnect project and the solar photovoltaic project 
higher operation and maintenance expense due to the following million in accrued severance costs from current and approved reductions in staffing  million in incremental inspection and repair costs related to the outages at san onofre  net of sce share of payments received from mhi  and million of lower costs related to information technology  transmission and distribution expenses  san onofre and benefits realized from edisonsmartconnect 
higher depreciation  decommissioning and amortization expense of million was primarily related to increased generation  transmission and distribution investments  including capitalized software costs 
million charge due to the grc decision disallowing capitalized costs incurred as part of sce implementation of sap enterprise resource planning system 
higher net interest expense and other of million was primarily due to higher outstanding balances on long term debt due to new issuances

utility cost recovery activities were primarily affected by the following higher purchased power expense of million primarily driven by the cost to replace cdwr contracts that expired in  which were not previously recorded as an sce cost but impacted customer bills see supplemental operating revenue information below  and higher costs associated with renewable contracts 
the increase was partially offset by increased purchased power in during the outages at san onofre and four corners 
higher operation and maintenance expense of million primarily due to an increase in spending for various public purpose programs 
supplemental operating revenue information sce retail billed and unbilled revenue excluding wholesale sales and balancing account over undercollections was billion for and billion for both and the revenue reflects a sales volume increase of billion  primarily due to sce providing power that was previously provided by cdwr contracts which expired in  partially offset by a rate decrease of million  resulting from rate adjustments in june and august  primarily reflecting lower natural gas prices and refunds to customers of over collected fuel and power procurement related costs

the loss reflects an earnings charge of billion due to the full impairment of the investment in eme during the fourth quarter of as a result of the deconsolidation of eme  recognition of losses previously deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income  a provision for losses from the eme bankruptcy and estimated tax impacts related to the expected future tax deconsolidation and separation of eme from edison international 
the loss also reflects a million earnings charge associated with the divestiture by homer city of substantially all of its remaining assets and certain specified liabilities 
the loss reflects an earnings charge of billion recorded in the fourth quarter of resulting primarily from the impairment of the homer city  fisk  crawford and waukegan power plants and wind related charges 
in addition to the charges recorded in and the increase in loss also reflects lower average realized energy and capacity prices and lower generation at the midwest generation plants and decreased earnings from natural gas fired projects

liquidity and capital resources sce sce ability to operate its business  fund capital expenditures  and implement its business strategy is dependent upon its cash flow and access to the capital markets 
sce overall cash flows fluctuate based on  among other things  its ability to recover its costs in a timely manner from its customers through regulated rates  changes in commodity prices and volumes  collateral requirements  interest and dividend payments to edison international  and the outcome of tax and regulatory matters 
sce expects to fund its obligations  capital expenditures and dividends through operating cash flows  tax benefits including bonus depreciation and capital market financings of debt and preferred equity  as needed 
sce also has availability under its credit facilities to fund requirements 
in january  sce issued  shares of series g preference stock cumulative   liquidation value to sce trust ii  a special purpose entity formed to issue trust securities as discussed in item notes to consolidated financial statements note variable interest entities 
the proceeds from the sale of these shares will be used to redeem all outstanding shares of series b and c preference stock 
available liquidity during  sce replaced its existing credit facilities scheduled to mature in early with a new billion five year revolving credit facility that matures may the following table summarizes the status of the sce credit facility at december  in millions commitment outstanding borrowings supported by credit facilities outstanding letters of credit amount available debt covenant the debt covenant in sce credit facility limits its debt to total capitalization ratio to less than or equal to to at december   sce debt to total capitalization ratio was to capital investment plan sce forecasted capital expenditures for include a capital forecast in the range of billion to billion based on the average variability experienced in  and of between annual forecast capital expenditures and actual spending 
the completion of projects  the timing of expenditures  and the associated cost recovery may be affected by permitting requirements and delays  construction schedules  availability of labor  equipment and materials  financing  legal and regulatory approvals and developments  weather and other unforeseen conditions 
sce capital expenditures and the capital expenditures forecast are set forth in the table below in millions actual total transmission distribution generation total estimated capital expenditures total estimated capital expenditures for using variability discussed above included in sce capital expenditures plan are projected environmental capital expenditures of million and million in and  respectively 
the projected environmental capital expenditures are to comply with laws  regulations  and other nondiscretionary requirements 
transmission projects a summary of sce large transmission and substation projects during the next two years is presented below project name description project lifecycle phase scheduled in service date direct expenditures in millions of spend complete forecast in millions tehachapi transmission lines and substation in construction devers colorado river transmission line and upgraded substation in construction eldorado ivanpah substation and upgraded transmission line in construction direct expenditures include direct labor  land and contract costs incurred for the respective projects and exclude overhead costs that are included in the capital expenditures forecasted for in november  sce filed with the cpuc its revised cost estimates for the devers colorado transmission project 
in january  sce revised its cost estimates for eldorado ivanpah from million to million based on the current number of executed generator interconnection agreements 
as of the date of this report  sce has deferred its cost update filing with the cpuc for the tehachapi transmission project until it has more clarity on projected cost and schedule impacts  including in october  the cpuc staff notified sce that the constructed portions of the project should be marked and lighted as required  but instructed sce to defer completion of remaining project components that may require aviation marking or lighting pending cpuc review of the petition to modify 
sce has filed a petition to modify seeking authorization to install aviation marking and lighting in accordance with faa standards 
community opposition to portions of the project continues and requests for reconsideration of the cpuc decision approving the project remain pending 
in response to this opposition  cpuc proceedings to reexamine construction options  including undergrounding lines  for a portion of the project may further impact the project cost and schedule 
in november  the cpuc assigned commissioner issued a ruling expediting its efforts to reconsider identified undergrounding options for a portion of the project 
the ruling states that the construction of the affected portion of the project shall remain deferred until the cpuc makes a final determination regarding the options 
in december  sce provided information to the cpuc on potential new options for a portion of the project  including possibly undergrounding lines 
sce anticipates a final decision in these proceedings by the third quarter of adoption of an undergrounding option or other significant modification to the original route or construction plan could create additional costs and could delay the completion of the project 
as with all transmission investments  cost recovery will be subject to future rate proceedings 
distribution projects distribution expenditures include projects and programs to meet customer load growth requirements  reliability and infrastructure replacement needs  information and other technology and related facility requirements sometimes referred to as general plant 
generation projects generation expenditures include nuclear related capital expenditures necessary to maintain safe and reliable plant operation  meet nrc and other regulatory requirements  and optimize plant performance and cost effectiveness have been included in the forecast 
nuclear related capital expenditures will be limited to safety and compliance items only until the future operations of the units are known 
hydro related capital expenditures associated with infrastructure and equipment replacement and renewal of ferc operating licenses 
infrastructure expenditures include dam improvements  flowline and substation refurbishments  and powerline replacements 
equipment replacement expenditures include transformers  automation  switchgear  hydro turbine repowers  generator rewinds  and small generator replacements 
regulatory proceedings energy efficiency incentive mechanism in december  the cpuc adopted an energy efficiency incentive mechanism for the energy efficiency program performance period and awarded sce million in shareholder earnings for the management of its energy efficiency portfolio during the portion of the program performance period 
for the and performance period incentives  sce will file its shareholder earnings claims after the cpuc releases its financial and management audit reports  expected in the third quarter of and  respectively 
sce estimates it could be awarded an additional million and million for and periods  respectively  pending the completion of the cpuc financial and management audits for each of these program periods 
there is no assurance that the cpuc will make an award for any given year 
ferc formula rates in august  the ferc accepted  subject to refund and settlement procedures  sce request to implement a formula rate effective january  to determine sce ferc transmission revenue requirement  including its construction work in progress cwip revenue requirement that was previously recovered through a separate mechanism 
sce request would result in a total ferc weighted average roe of including a base roe of and the previously authorized basis point incentive for caiso participation and individual authorized project incentives 
the formula rate mechanism  including the base roe  is subject to final resolution as part of the settlement process or  if a settlement is not achieved  to determination by ferc in a litigated process 
sce and the other parties to the proceeding continue to engage in settlement negotiations 
in september  sce filed its first formula rate update with the ferc  which included a transmission revenue requirement of million  an increase of million or over the transmission revenue requirement 
sce began billing customers  subject to refund  the higher rates on october  several parties have protested the filing and ferc action remains pending 
income taxes the american taxpayer relief act of extended bonus depreciation for qualifying property through and through for certain long production period property 
this extension is expected to provide sce with additional cash flow benefits  but as a result of existing net operating loss carryforwards  such cash flow benefits are not expected until the impact on cash flow represents an acceleration of tax benefits that would have otherwise been deductible over the life of the qualifying assets 
dividend restrictions the cpuc regulates sce capital structure which limits the dividends it may pay edison international 
sce may make distributions to edison international as long as the common equity component of sce capital structure remains at or above the on a month weighted average basis 
at december   sce month weighted average common equity component of total capitalization was resulting in a restriction on net assets of billion 
at december   the maximum additional dividend that sce could pay to edison international under this limitation was approximately million 
during  sce made million in dividend payments to its parent  edison international 
future dividend amounts and timing of distributions are dependent upon several factors including the level of capital expenditures  operating cash flows and earnings 
margin and collateral deposits certain derivative instruments  power procurement contracts and other contractual arrangements contain collateral requirements 
future collateral requirements may differ from the requirements at december   due to the addition of incremental power and energy procurement contracts with collateral requirements  if any  and the impact of changes in wholesale power and natural gas prices on sce contractual obligations 
some of the power procurement contracts contain provisions that require sce to maintain an investment grade credit rating from the major credit rating agencies 
if sce credit rating were to fall below investment grade  sce may be required to pay the liability or post additional collateral 
the table below provides the amount of collateral posted by sce to its counterparties as well as the potential collateral that would be required as of december  in millions collateral posted as of december  incremental collateral requirements for power procurement contracts resulting from a potential downgrade of sce credit rating to below investment grade posted and potential collateral requirements collateral provided to counterparties and other brokers consisted of million of cash which was offset against net derivative liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets  million of cash reflected in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets and million in letters of credit and surety bonds 
total posted and potential collateral requirements may increase by million based on sce forward positions as of december  due to adverse market price movements over the remaining lives of the existing power procurement contracts using a confidence level 
workers compensation self insurance fund sce is self insured for workers compensation claims 
sce assesses workers compensation claims that have been asserted and those that have been incurred but not reported to determine the probable amount of losses that should be recorded 
the department of industrial relations for the state of california requires companies that are self insured for workers compensation to post collateral in the form of cash and or letters of credits based on the estimated workers compensation liability if a company bond rating were to fall below b 
as of december   if sce bond rating were to fall below a b rating  sce would be required to post million for its workers compensation self insurance plan 
regulatory balancing accounts sce cash flows are affected by regulatory balancing accounts over or under collections 
over and under collections represent differences between cash collected in current rates for specified forecasted costs and the costs actually incurred 
with some exceptions  sce seeks to adjust rates on an annual basis or at other designated times to recover or refund the balances recorded in its balancing account 
under or over collections in these balancing accounts impact cash flows and can change rapidly 
over and under collections accrue interest based on a three month commercial paper rate published by the federal reserve 
as of december   balancing accounts net over collections were billion primarily related to public purpose related program costs as well as fuel and power procurement related costs 
over collections for public purpose related programs are expected to decrease as costs are incurred to fund programs established by the cpuc 
the fuel and power procurement related over collections of million are expected to be refunded through a rate adjustment in ferc formula rates beginning in  sce implemented  subject to refund  a formula rate for its ferc jurisdiction base transmission revenue requirement 
under operation of the formula rate  transmission revenue will be trued up to actual cost of service annually 
at december   revenue collected in excess of recognized revenue under the proposed formula rate was million 
edison international parent and other edison international parent and other expects to fund its obligations and dividends to common shareholders through dividends received from sce and access to banks and capital markets 
during the second quarter of  edison international parent replaced its credit facilities with a new billion five year revolving credit facility that matures may which is all available at december  the debt covenant in edison international credit facility requires a consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio of less than or equal to to the ratio is defined in the credit agreement and generally excluded the consolidated debt and total capital of eme during the periods it was consolidated for financial reporting purposes

net cash from operating activities decreased million in compared to primarily due to the following million decrease from refunding to customers over collections of revenue which resulted from actual electricity sales exceeding forecasted electricity sales 
sce began refunding this balance through a rate adjustment effective june   million decrease resulting from higher balancing account over collections for fuel and power procurement related costs in when compared to over collections of approximately million in compared to approximately million in 
the over collections was primarily due to lower realized gas and power prices compared to the amounts forecasted for setting customer rates 
sce began refunding the over collections through a rate adjustments beginning on june  the balancing account was over collected by million at december   million at december   million at december and under collected by million at december   and million increase resulting from higher income before depreciation and income taxes primarily driven by higher customer revenue

see item notes to consolidated financial statements note compensation and benefit plans for further information 
at december   edison international and sce had a total net liability recorded for uncertain tax positions of million and million  respectively  which is excluded from the table 
edison international and sce cannot make reliable estimates of the cash flows by period due to uncertainty surrounding the timing of resolving these open tax issues with the irs 
the contractual obligations table does not include derivative obligations and asset retirement obligations  which are discussed in item notes to consolidated financial statements note derivative instruments and hedging activities  and note property  plant and equipment  respectively 
contingencies edison international has a contingency related to the eme chapter bankruptcy filing and sce has contingencies related to the san onofre outage  inspection and repair issues  sed investigations  four corners new source review litigation  nuclear insurance  wildfire insurance and spent nuclear fuel which are discussed in item notes to consolidated financial statements note commitments and contingencies 
environmental remediation sce records its environmental remediation liabilities when site assessments and or remedial actions are probable and a range of reasonably likely cleanup costs can be estimated 
sce reviews its sites and measures the liability quarterly  by assessing a range of reasonably likely costs for each identified site using currently available information  including existing technology  presently enacted laws and regulations  experience gained at similar sites  and the probable level of involvement and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties 
these estimates include costs for site investigations  remediation  operations and maintenance  monitoring and site closure 
unless there is a probable amount  sce records the lower end of this reasonably likely range of costs classified as other long term liabilities at undiscounted amounts as timing of cash flows is uncertain 
as of december   sce had identified material sites for remediation and recorded an estimated minimum liability of million 
sce expects to recover of its remediation costs at certain sites

market risk exposures edison international and sce primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates  commodity prices and volumes  and counterparty credit 
fluctuations in interest rates can affect earnings and cash flows 
fluctuations in commodity prices and volumes and counterparty credit losses may temporarily affect cash flows  but are not expected to affect earnings due to expected recovery through regulatory mechanisms 
derivative instruments are used  as appropriate  to manage market risks including market risks of sce customers 
for a further discussion of market risk exposures  including commodity price risk  credit risk and interest rate risk  see item notes to consolidated financial statements note derivative instruments and hedging activities and note fair value measurements 
interest rate risk edison international and sce are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its financing and short term investing activities used for liquidity purposes  to fund business operations and to fund capital investments 
the nature and amount of edison international and sce long term and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
changes in interest rate may impact sce authorized rate of return for the period beyond  see item business overview of ratemaking process cpuc for further discussion 
the following table summarizes the increase or decrease to the fair value of long term debt including the current portion as of december   if the market interest rates were changed while leaving all other assumptions the same in millions carrying value fair value increase decrease sce edison international commodity price risk sce and its customers are exposed to the risk of a change in the market price of natural gas  electric power and transmission congestion 
sce hedging program reduces exposure to variability in market prices related to sce purchases and sales of electric power and natural gas 
sce expects recovery of its related hedging costs through the erra balancing account or cpuc approved procurement plans  and as a result  exposure to commodity price is not expected to impact earnings  but may impact timing of cash flows 
to the extent san onofre unit and unit are not operating  sce may be exposed to market prices associated with replacement power costs 
sce hedging program reduces customer exposure to variability in market prices 
as part of this program  sce enters into energy options  swaps  forward arrangements  tolling arrangements  and congestion revenue rights crrs 
the transactions are pre approved by the cpuc or executed in compliance with cpuc approved procurement plans 
fair value of derivative instruments with some exceptions  derivative instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
realized gains and losses from derivative instruments are expected to be recovered from or refunded to customers through regulatory mechanisms and  therefore  sce fair value changes have no impact on earnings 
sce does not use hedge accounting for these transactions due to this regulatory accounting treatment 
for further discussion on fair value measurements and the fair value hierarchy  see item notes to consolidated financial statements note fair value measurements 
the fair value of outstanding derivative instruments used to mitigate exposure to commodity price risk was a net liability of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the following table summarizes the increase or decrease to the fair values of outstanding derivative instruments as of december   if the electricity prices or gas prices were changed while leaving all other assumptions constant in millions december  increase in electricity prices by decrease in electricity prices by increase in gas prices by decrease in gas prices by credit risk for information related to credit risks  see item notes to consolidated financial statements note derivative instruments and hedging activities 
credit risk exposure from counterparties for power and gas trading activities is measured as the sum of net accounts receivable accounts receivable less accounts payable and the current fair value of net derivative assets derivative assets less derivative liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheets 
sce enters into master agreements which typically provide for a right of setoff 
accordingly  sce credit risk exposure from counterparties is based on a net exposure under these arrangements 
sce manages the credit risk on the portfolio for both rated and non rated counterparties based on credit ratings using published ratings of counterparties and other publicly disclosed information  such as financial statements  regulatory filings  and press releases  to guide it in the process of setting credit levels  risk limits and contractual arrangements  including master netting agreements 
as of december   the amount of balance sheet exposure as described above broken down by the credit ratings of sce counterparties  was as follows december  in millions exposure collateral net exposure s p credit rating a or higher bbb not rated total sce assigns a credit rating based on the lower of a counterparty s p or moody rating 
for ease of reference  the above table uses the s p classifications to summarize risk  but reflects the lower of the two credit ratings 
exposure excludes amounts related to contracts classified as normal purchases and sales and non derivative contractual commitments that are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets  except for any related net accounts receivable 
the exposure in this category relates to long term power purchase agreements 
sce exposure is mitigated by regulatory treatment 
critical accounting estimates and policies the accounting policies described below are considered critical to obtaining an understanding of edison international and sce consolidated financial statements because their application requires the use of significant estimates and judgments by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
management estimates and judgments are inherently uncertain and may differ significantly from actual results achieved 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires significant assumptions and changes in the estimate or  the use of alternative estimates  that could have a material impact on edison international results of operations or financial position 
for more information on edison international accounting policies  see item notes to consolidated financial statements note summary of significant accounting policies 
rate regulated enterprises nature of estimate required 
sce follows the accounting principles for rate regulated enterprises which are required for entities whose rates are set by regulators at levels intended to recover the estimated costs of providing service  plus a return on net investment  or rate base 
regulators may also impose certain penalties or grant certain incentives 
due to timing and other differences in the collection of revenue  these principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged as an expense by an unregulated entity to be capitalized as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates  conversely the principles allow creation of a regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred 
key assumptions and approach used 
sce management assesses at the end of each reporting period whether regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as the current regulatory environment  the issuance of rate orders on recovery of the specific or a similar incurred cost to sce or other rate regulated entities in california  and other factors that would indicate that the regulator will treat an incurred cost as allowable for ratemaking purposes 
using these factors  management has determined that existing regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or settlement 
this determination reflects the current regulatory climate in california and is subject to change in the future 
effect if different assumptions used 
significant management judgment is required to evaluate the anticipated recovery of regulatory assets  the recognition of incentives and revenue subject to refund  as well as the anticipated cost of regulatory liabilities or penalties 
if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable  all or part of the regulatory assets and liabilities would have to be written off against current period earnings 
at december   the consolidated balance sheets included regulatory assets of billion and regulatory liabilities of billion 
if different judgments were reached on recovery of costs and timing of income recognition  sce earnings may vary from the amounts reported 
application to the san onofre outage  inspection and repair issues as described in management overview  san onofre unit and unit have been taken off line for extensive inspections  testing and analysis of their steam generators 
in october  the cpuc issued an order instituting investigation that consolidates all san onofre issues in related regulatory proceedings and considers appropriate cost recovery for all san onofre costs  including among other costs  the costs of the steam generator replacement project  substitute market power costs  capital and operations and maintenance costs  and seismic study costs 
in parallel with the oii  the grc final decision requires sce to track san onofre related costs in a memorandum account subject to refund  beginning january  in connection with the preparation of its year end financial statements  sce believes that actions taken and costs incurred in connection with the san onofre replacement steam generators and outages have been prudent 
accordingly  sce considers its operating  capital  and market power costs  recoverable through base rates and the erra balancing account  as offset by third party recoveries where applicable 
sce cannot provide assurance that either or both units of san onofre will be returned to service  that the cpuc will not disallow costs incurred or order refunds to customers of amounts collected in rates  or that sce will be successful in recovering amounts from third parties 
a delay in the restart of san onofre unit beyond this summer may impact plans for future operations 
disallowances of costs and or refund of amounts received from customers could be material and adversely affect sce financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
impairment of long lived assets nature of estimates required 
long lived assets  including intangible assets  are evaluated for impairment in accordance with applicable authoritative guidance 
authoritative guidance requires that if the undiscounted expected future cash flow from a company assets or group of assets without interest charges is less than its carrying value  asset impairment must be recognized on the financial statements 
the impairment charges  if applicable  are calculated as the excess of the asset carrying value over its fair value  which represents the discounted expected future cash flows attributable to the asset or  in the case of assets expected to be sold  at fair value less costs to sell 
long lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever indicators exist or when there is a commitment to sell or dispose of the asset 
these evaluations may result from significant decreases in the market price of an asset  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset  as well as economic or operational analyses 
key assumptions and approach used 
the assessment of impairment requires significant management judgment to determine if an indicator of impairment has occurred  how assets should be grouped  the forecast of undiscounted expected future cash flow over the asset estimated useful life to determine if an impairment exists  and if an impairment exists  the fair value of the asset or asset group 
factors that are considered important  which could trigger an impairment  include operating losses from a project  projected future operating losses  the financial condition of counterparties  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
the determination of fair value requires management to apply judgment in estimating future prices of energy and capacity in wholesale energy markets and fuel prices that are susceptible to significant change  environmental and maintenance expenditures  and the time period due to the length of the estimated remaining useful lives 
effect if different assumptions used 
the estimates and assumptions used to determine whether an impairment exists are subject to a high degree of uncertainty 
the estimated fair value of an asset would change materially if different estimates and assumptions were used to determine the amounts or timing of future revenues  environmental compliance costs or operating expenditures 
accounting for contingencies  guarantees and indemnities nature of estimates required 
edison international and sce record loss contingencies when management determines that the outcome of future events is probable of occurring and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
when a guarantee or indemnification subject to authoritative guidance is entered into  edison international and sce record a liability for the estimated fair value of the underlying guarantee or indemnification 
gain contingencies are recognized in the financial statements when they are realized 
key assumptions and approach used 
the determination of a reserve for a loss contingency is based on management judgment and estimates with respect to the likely outcome of the matter  including the analysis of different scenarios 
liabilities are recorded or adjusted when events or circumstances cause these judgments or estimates to change 
in assessing whether a loss is a reasonable possibility  edison international and sce may consider the following factors  among others the nature of the litigation  claim or assessment  available information  opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisors  and the experience gained from similar cases 
edison international and sce provide disclosures for material contingencies when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may be incurred 
some guarantees and indemnifications could have a significant financial impact under certain circumstances  and management also considers the probability of such circumstances occurring when estimating the fair value 
effect if different assumptions used 
actual amounts realized upon settlement of contingencies may be different than amounts recorded and disclosed and could have a significant impact on the liabilities  revenue and expenses recorded on the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  for guarantees and indemnities actual results may differ from the amounts recorded and disclosed and could have a significant impact on edison international and sce consolidated financial statements 
for a discussion of contingencies  guarantees and indemnities  see item notes to consolidated financial statements note commitments and contingencies 
application to joint liabilities with eme and its bankruptcy proceeding on december   eme and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
as a result of the bankruptcy filing and beginning on the petition date  edison international determined that it no longer retains significant influence over eme and accordingly  the assets and liabilities of eme are no longer consolidated with those of edison international 
edison international parent has not guaranteed the obligations of eme  however  under the internal revenue code and applicable state statutes  edison international parent is jointly liable for qualified retirement plans and federal and specific state tax liabilities 
as a result of the deconsolidation and the existence of joint liabilities  edison international has recorded liabilities at december  of million for qualified retirement plans related to plan participants of eme and million of liabilities related to joint tax liabilities 
under the qualified plan documents and tax allocation agreements  eme is obligated for such liabilities and  accordingly  edison international has recorded receivables of million from eme net of amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income of million related to actuarial losses under the qualified retirement plans 
on december   edison international  eme and certain of eme senior unsecured noteholders entered into a support agreement as described in
