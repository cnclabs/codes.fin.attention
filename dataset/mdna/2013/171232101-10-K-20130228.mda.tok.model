chubb assumes no obligation to update any forward looking information set forth in this document  which speak as of the date hereof 
critical accounting estimates and judgments the consolidated financial statements include amounts based on informed estimates and judgments of management for transactions that are not yet complete 
such estimates and judgments affect the reported amounts in the financial statements 
those estimates and judgments that were most critical to the preparation of the financial statements involved the determination of loss reserves and the recoverability of related reinsurance recoverables and the evaluation of whether a decline in value of any investment is temporary or other than temporary 
these estimates and judgments  which are discussed within the following analysis of our results of operations  require the use of assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and therefore are subject to change as facts and circumstances develop 
if different estimates and judgments had been applied  materially different amounts might have been reported in the financial statements 

table of contents overview the following highlights do not address all of the matters covered in the other sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or contain all of the information that may be important to chubb s shareholders or the investing public 
this overview should be read in conjunction with the other sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
net income was billion in  billion in and billion in the decrease in net income in compared with was due to both lower operating income and lower net realized investment gains 
the decrease in net income in compared with was due primarily to lower operating income and  to a lesser extent  lower net realized investment gains 
we define operating income as net income excluding realized investment gains and losses after tax 
operating income was billion in  billion in and billion in the modestly lower operating income in compared with that in was due primarily to lower property and casualty investment income 
the underwriting income of our property and casualty insurance business was similar in both years 
the lower operating income in compared with that in was due to substantially lower underwriting income  attributable in large part to a higher impact of catastrophes 
property and casualty investment income was flat in compared with that in management uses operating income  a non gaap financial measure  among other measures  to evaluate its performance because the realization of investment gains and losses in any period could be discretionary as to timing and can fluctuate significantly  which could distort the analysis of operating trends 
underwriting results in were adversely affected by costs of million before tax related to storm sandy  including estimated net losses of million and reinsurance reinstatement premium costs of million 
the total costs of catastrophes before tax were  million in   million in and million in underwriting results were profitable in and  compared with highly profitable results in our combined loss and expense ratio was in and and in the less profitable underwriting results in and compared to were primarily due to a substantially higher impact of catastrophes 
the impact of catastrophes accounted for percentage points of the combined ratio in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in during  and  we experienced overall favorable development of million  million and million  respectively  on loss reserves established as of the previous year end 
the favorable development in each year was due primarily to favorable loss experience in certain commercial liability  professional liability and personal insurance classes 
total net premiums written increased by in and in the effect of foreign currency translation on total net premium growth was slightly negative in compared to a slightly positive impact in net premiums written in the united states increased by in both and net premiums written outside the united states decreased by in and increased by in when measured in local currencies  such premiums grew slightly in and grew significantly in in both years  premium growth both inside and outside the united states was limited by our emphasis on underwriting discipline in a highly competitive market and our focus on rate adequacy and profitability for both renewal and new business 
property and casualty investment income after tax decreased by in and was flat in in what continued to be a low yield investment environment 
management uses property and casualty investment income after tax  a non gaap financial measure  to evaluate its investment results because it reflects the impact of any change in the proportion of tax exempt investment income to total investment income and is therefore more meaningful for analysis purposes than investment income before income tax 

table of contents net realized investment gains before tax were million million after tax in compared with million million after tax in and million million after tax in the net realized gains in were primarily related to fixed maturities and investments in limited partnerships 
the net realized gains in and were primarily related to investments in limited partnerships 
a summary of our consolidated net income is as follows years ended december in millions property and casualty insurance corporate and other consolidated operating income before income tax federal and foreign income tax consolidated operating income realized investment gains after income tax consolidated net income property and casualty insurance a summary of the results of operations of our property and casualty insurance business is as follows years ended december in millions underwriting net premiums written increase in unearned premiums premiums earned losses and loss expenses operating costs and expenses increase in deferred policy acquisition costs dividends to policyholders underwriting income investments investment income before expenses investment expenses investment income other income property and casualty income before tax property and casualty investment income after tax property and casualty income before tax was modestly lower in than in  which in turn was significantly lower than in the modestly lower income in compared with was due primarily to a decrease in investment income 
underwriting income was similar in both years 
the lower level of property and casualty income before tax in compared with was due to a substantial decrease in underwriting income that was primarily the result of a higher impact of catastrophes during and a decrease in current accident year underwriting profitability excluding the impact of catastrophes 
investment income was flat in compared with that in the profitability of our property and casualty insurance business depends on the results of both our underwriting and investment operations 
we view these as two distinct operations since the underwriting functions are managed separately from the investment function 
accordingly  in assessing our performance  we evaluate underwriting results separately from investment results 

table of contents underwriting operations underwriting results we evaluate the underwriting results of our property and casualty insurance business in the aggregate and also for each of our separate business units 
net premiums written net premiums written were billion in  billion in and billion in net premiums written by business unit were as follows years ended december increase decrease vs 
increase vs 
dollars in millions personal insurance commercial insurance specialty insurance total insurance reinsurance assumed total the change in net premiums written is not presented since this business is in runoff 
net premiums written increased by in compared with and in compared with net premiums written in the united states  which in represented of our total net premiums  increased by in both and compared with the respective prior year 
net premiums written outside the united states  expressed in us dollars  decreased by in and increased by in in  foreign currency translation had a negative impact on growth of net premiums written outside the united states  reflecting the impact of the stronger us dollar relative to several currencies in which we wrote business in compared to conversely  in  foreign currency translation had a positive impact on growth of net premiums written outside the united states reflecting the impact of the weaker us dollar relative to several currencies in which we wrote business in compared to measured in local currencies  net premiums written outside the united states grew slightly in and grew significantly in the countries outside the united states which were significant contributors to net premiums written in recent years were the united kingdom  canada  brazil  australia and germany 
we classify business as written in the united states or outside the united states based on the location of the risk associated with the underlying policies 
the method of determining location of risk varies by class of business 
location of risk for property classes is typically based on the physical location of the covered property  while location of risk for liability classes may be based on the main location of the insured  or in the case of the workers compensation class  the primary work location of the covered employee 
net premiums written in the united states increased in as a result of growth in our personal and commercial insurance segments 
net premiums written in the united states for our specialty insurance segment  of which the predominant component is our professional liability insurance business  decreased in growth in our personal insurance business was attributable to new business  strong retention of existing business as well as higher rates and insured exposures upon renewal 
while the pricing environment was positive during in the commercial and professional liability classes  continuing a trend that began during  the positive trend had a more significant impact on growth in our commercial insurance business 
premium growth in our professional liability business remained constrained in by the continuing effects of the economic downturn and our focus on rate adequacy and profitability in what remains a highly competitive marketplace 

table of contents in  overall growth in net premiums written in the united states was due to growth in our commercial insurance segment  which reflected general improvement in the rate environment for this business 
net premiums written in the united states for our personal insurance segment were flat in compared to net premiums written in the united states for our specialty insurance segment decreased modestly in  due to overall slightly lower renewal rates and a decrease in new business compared to average renewal rates for our personal insurance business in the united states were up slightly in  driven by our homeowners business 
in  average renewal rates for our personal insurance business in the united states were close to flat compared with overall  average renewal rates in in the united states were up significantly in both our commercial and professional liability business in comparison to expiring rates 
average renewal rates in were up modestly in our commercial business but were down slightly in our professional liability business 
the amounts of coverage purchased or the insured exposures  both of which are bases upon which we calculate the premiums we charge  remained generally flat in both years compared to the respective prior year 
we continued to retain a high percentage of our existing business in our commercial and professional liability classes in both years  but renewal retention levels in were lower than those in  as we continued to seek renewal rate increases in most of these classes  and take underwriting actions to improve profitability  particularly in some of the professional liability classes 
in both years  the overall level of new business was down for these components of our business  reflecting the competitive market as well as our underwriting discipline 
net premiums written outside the united states decreased modestly in  as slight growth in our personal insurance segment was more than offset by decreases in our commercial and specialty insurance segments 
the lack of growth in our business outside the united states was primarily due to a lower level of new business in a weak rate environment for commercial and specialty insurance products and  to a lesser extent  the negative impact of foreign currency translation 
in  net premiums written outside the united states grew in all segments of the business  due in part to the positive impact of foreign currency translation 
particularly strong growth occurred in our personal insurance business outside the united states in average renewal rates for our personal insurance business outside the united states were close to flat in and we continued to retain a high percentage of our customers and new business was also positive in both years  but more so in overall  average renewal rates outside the united states were up slightly in in both the commercial and professional liability components of our business in comparison to expiring rates 
rates were down slightly in in both components 
the amounts of coverage purchased or the insured exposures remained flat in our commercial business in and were up slightly in compared to the respective prior year 
for our professional liability business  the amounts of coverage purchased were down slightly in both years 
we continued to retain a high percentage of our existing commercial and professional liability business in both years  but renewal retention levels in were lower than those in the overall level of new business was down in compared to for both our commercial and professional liability business 
in  the overall level of new business was up in our commercial insurance business and flat in the professional liability business compared to the highly competitive market conditions worldwide are likely to continue in we expect that the positive pricing environment in the united states  which began in and continued throughout  will continue into outside the united states  we expect that the slightly positive pricing environment will continue in in addition  while there have been signs over the last two years that areas of the global economy have been improving  the improvement has been inconsistent across geographies and industries 
if there is sustained improvement in the economy  it should result in a positive impact on premiums  although there is typically a lag between the recovery and any resulting growth in premiums 
we expect our net written premiums will be modestly higher in compared with  assuming average foreign currency to us dollar exchange rates in remain similar to year end levels 

table of contents the reinsurance assumed business has been in runoff since the sale of our ongoing reinsurance assumed business in december reinsurance ceded our premiums written are net of amounts ceded to reinsurers who assume a portion of the risk under the insurance policies we write that are subject to reinsurance 
most of our ceded reinsurance arrangements consist of excess of loss and catastrophe contracts that protect against a specified part or all of certain types of losses over stipulated amounts arising from any one occurrence or event 
therefore  unless we incur losses that exceed our initial retention under these contracts  we do not receive any loss recoveries 
as a result  in some years  we cede premiums to reinsurance companies and receive few  if any  loss recoveries 
however  in a year in which there is a significant catastrophic event  such as storm sandy in  or a series of large individual losses  we may receive substantial loss recoveries 
the impact of ceded reinsurance on net premiums written and net premiums earned and on net losses and loss expenses incurred for the three years ended december  is presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the most significant component of our ceded reinsurance program is property reinsurance 
we purchase two main types of property reinsurance catastrophe and property per risk 
for property risks in the united states and canada  we purchase traditional catastrophe reinsurance  including our primary treaty which we refer to as our north american catastrophe treaty  as well as supplemental catastrophe reinsurance that provides additional coverage for our exposures in the northeastern united states 
for certain exposures in the united states  we have also arranged for the purchase of multi year  collateralized reinsurance funded through the issuance of collateralized risk linked securities  known as catastrophe bonds 
for events outside the united states  we also purchase traditional catastrophe reinsurance 
the north american catastrophe treaty has an initial retention of million and provides coverage for exposures in the united states and canada of approximately of losses net of recoveries from other available reinsurance between million and million and approximately of losses net of recoveries between million and billion 
for certain catastrophic events in the northeastern part of the united states or along the southern us coastline  the combination of the north american catastrophe treaty  supplemental catastrophe reinsurance and or the catastrophe bond arrangements provide additional coverages as discussed below 
the catastrophe bond arrangements provide reinsurance coverage for specific types of losses in specific geographic locations 
they are generally designed to supplement coverage provided under the north american catastrophe treaty 
we currently have two catastrophe bond arrangements in effect 
we have a million reinsurance arrangement  a portion of which expires in march and the remainder in march  that provides coverage for our exposure to homeowners and commercial losses related to certain hurricane  earthquake  severe thunderstorm and winter storm loss events in twelve states in the northeastern united states and the district of columbia 
we also have a million reinsurance arrangement that expires in march that provides coverage for homeowners related hurricane and severe thunderstorm losses in eight states along the southern us coastline 
for the indicated catastrophic events in the northeastern united states  the combination of the north american catastrophe treaty  the supplemental catastrophe reinsurance and the million catastrophe bond arrangement provides additional coverage of approximately of losses net of recoveries from other available reinsurance between billion and billion 
for hurricane and severe thunderstorm events along the southern us coastline  the million catastrophe bond arrangement provides additional coverage of approximately of homeowners related hurricane and severe thunderstorm losses net of recoveries from other available reinsurance between million and billion 

table of contents for hurricane events in florida  in addition to the coverage provided by the north american catastrophe treaty and the million catastrophe bond arrangement discussed above  we have reinsurance from the florida hurricane catastrophe fund fhcf  which is a state mandated fund designed to reimburse insurers for a portion of their residential catastrophic hurricane losses 
our participation in this mandatory program limits our initial retention in florida for homeowners related losses to approximately million and provides coverage of of covered losses between approximately million and million 
our primary property catastrophe treaty for events outside the united states  including canada  provides coverage of approximately of losses net of recoveries from other available reinsurance between million and million 
for catastrophic events in australia and canada  additional reinsurance provides coverage of of losses net of recoveries from other available reinsurance between million and million 
in addition to catastrophe treaties  we also have a commercial property per risk treaty 
this treaty provides coverage per risk of approximately million to million depending upon the currency in which the insurance policy was issued in excess of our initial retention 
our initial retention is generally between million and million 
in addition to our major property catastrophe and property per risk treaties  we purchase several smaller property treaties that only cover specific classes of business or locations having concentrations of risk 
recoveries under our property reinsurance treaties are subject to certain coinsurance requirements that affect the interaction of some elements of our reinsurance program 
our property reinsurance treaties generally contain terrorism exclusions for acts perpetrated by foreign terrorists  and for nuclear  biological  chemical and radiological loss causes whether such acts are perpetrated by foreign or domestic terrorists 
after stabilizing in  reinsurance rates for property risks increased in due in large part to the significant catastrophe losses incurred worldwide by the insurance industry in nevertheless  based on changes in coverage we made upon renewal of the major components of our program  the overall cost of our property reinsurance program was modestly lower in than in  excluding the reinstatement premium costs associated with storm sandy 
we do not expect the changes we made to our property reinsurance program during to have a material effect on the corporation s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
our major  traditional property reinsurance treaties expire on april  although the industry incurred significant catastrophe losses in  particularly in the united states  we expect that reinsurance rates for property risks will vary somewhat in depending on individual insurers and reinsurers exposure to storm sandy related losses 
the final structure of our reinsurance program and amount of coverage purchased  including the mixture of traditional catastrophe reinsurance and collateralized reinsurance coverage funded through the issuance of collateralized risk linked securities  is still being determined and will affect our total reinsurance costs in profitability the combined loss and expense ratio or combined ratio  expressed as a percentage  is the key measure of underwriting profitability traditionally used in the property and casualty insurance business 
management evaluates the performance of our underwriting operations and of each of our business units using  among other measures  the combined ratio calculated in accordance with statutory accounting principles 
it is the sum of the ratio of losses and loss expenses to premiums earned loss ratio plus the ratio of statutory underwriting expenses to premiums written expense ratio after reducing both premium amounts by dividends to policyholders 
when the combined ratio is under  underwriting results are generally considered profitable  when the combined ratio is over  underwriting results are generally considered unprofitable 

table of contents statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies differ in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
under statutory accounting principles  policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses are recognized immediately  not at the time premiums are earned 
management uses underwriting results determined in accordance with gaap  among other measures  to assess the overall performance of our underwriting operations 
to convert statutory underwriting results to a gaap basis  certain policy acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
underwriting income determined in accordance with gaap is defined as premiums earned less losses and loss expenses incurred and gaap underwriting expenses incurred 
an accident year is the calendar year in which a loss is incurred or  in the case of claims made policies  the calendar year in which a loss is reported 
the total losses and loss expenses incurred for a particular calendar year include current accident year losses and loss expenses as well as any increases or decreases to our estimates of losses and loss expenses that occurred in all prior accident years  which we refer to as prior year loss development 
underwriting results were profitable in and and highly profitable in the combined loss and expense ratio for our overall property and casualty business was as follows years ended december loss ratio expense ratio combined loss and expense ratio while the loss ratio in each of the last three years included the negative impact of significant catastrophes  it also reflected favorable loss experience excluding catastrophes that we believe resulted from our disciplined underwriting in recent years  as well as moderate loss trends  particularly in our personal and commercial insurance segments 
results in our specialty insurance business  while profitable  have been adversely affected by the lingering effects of the weak economy in recent years 
results in all three years benefited from favorable prior year loss development 
for more information on prior year loss development  see property and casualty insurance loss reserves  prior year loss development 
the loss ratio in was similar to  as a lower amount of favorable prior year loss development and a slightly higher impact of catastrophes in were offset by a decrease in the current accident year loss ratio excluding catastrophes 
the loss ratio was higher in compared with due to a higher impact of catastrophes and a modest increase in the current accident year loss ratio excluding catastrophes 
our estimated net losses from storm sandy were million and we incurred million of reinsurance reinstatement premium costs related to the storm 
our estimated gross losses from storm sandy were about billion  with almost all of the losses from property claims  both commercial and homeowners  and only a modest impact from automobile and other claims 
our net losses of million were lower than the gross amount due primarily to our traditional property catastrophe treaty and  to a much lesser extent  per risk and quota share reinsurance treaties as well as facultative reinsurance placed on an individual risk basis 
while it is possible that our estimate of ultimate gross losses related to storm sandy could change in the future  we do not expect that any such change would have a material effect on the corporation s consolidated financial condition or liquidity  due to the substantial amount of remaining reinsurance available for this event under a combination of the catastrophe treaty and other components of our property reinsurance program 
in  the net impact of all catastrophes was billion  which represented percentage points of the combined ratio 
we incurred just under billion of catastrophe losses and million of related reinsurance reinstatement premium costs 
the impact of catastrophes was billion in and million in  which represented percentage points and percentage points  
table of contents respectively  of the combined ratio 
in  most of the impact of catastrophes was due to storm sandy  but there were also catastrophe losses related to other events  including several severe hail and wind storms in the united states 
a significant portion of the catastrophe losses in related to flooding in australia as well as tornadoes and other storms in the united states  including losses of about million related to hurricane irene 
a significant portion of the catastrophe losses in related to numerous storms in the united states and  to a lesser extent  an earthquake in chile 
the only reinsurance recoverable we had from our primary catastrophe reinsurance treaties during the three year period ended december  was that related to storm sandy because there was no other individual catastrophe event for which our losses exceeded our initial retention under the treaties 
under a region specific property catastrophe reinsurance treaty  we had recoveries of about million of our gross losses related to the earthquake in chile in our expense ratio increased only slightly in and compared with the respective prior year 
the increase in the expense ratio from to was due primarily to an increase in commissions on business written outside the united states partially offset by overhead expenses increasing at a lower rate than the rate of growth of premiums written 
the increase in commissions outside the united states was due primarily to premium growth in classes of business with higher commission rates 
review of underwriting results by business unit personal insurance net premiums written from personal insurance  which represented of our premiums written in  increased by in both and compared with the respective prior year 
net premiums written for the classes of business within the personal insurance segment were as follows years ended december increase vs 
increase vs 
dollars in millions automobile homeowners other total personal growth in net premiums written in our personal insurance business in occurred both inside and outside the united states  due in large part to new business  strong retention of existing business as well as higher rates and higher insured exposures upon renewal 
in  growth was more significant in the united states than growth outside the united states  which reflected the negative impact of foreign currency translation 
overall growth in net premiums written in our personal insurance business in was driven by growth outside the united states across all components of this business  due in large part to new business and  to a lesser extent  the positive impact of foreign currency translation 
personal automobile premiums increased slightly in and substantially in compared to the respective preceding year 
premium growth for personal automobile business in the united states  which remained a highly competitive marketplace  was modest in both years 
growth for personal automobile business written outside the united states was near flat in  as the negative impact of foreign currency translation offset the new business growth in select locations  compared with strong growth in premiums written outside the united states represented approximately of our net premiums written in for the automobile class worldwide  with a substantial portion written in brazil 
premiums from our homeowners business increased modestly in both years  with growth occurring both inside and outside the united states 
growth both inside and outside the united states in reflected higher renewal rates as well as increases in coverage on existing policies 
in  growth both inside and outside the united states was due primarily to new business and  to a lesser extent  increases in coverage on existing policies 
premiums from our other personal business  which includes accident and health  excess liability and yacht coverages  increased significantly in after increasing slightly in in 
table of contents  growth occurred in our excess liability business  which is predominantly written in the united states  and in our accident and health business  both inside and outside the united states 
growth in was attributable primarily to an increase in premiums in our excess liability business 
premiums for our accident and health business were flat in as growth outside the united states  attributable to new business initiatives and  to a lesser extent  the positive effect of foreign currency translation was offset by a significant decrease in premiums written inside the united states  due to our decision to exit and run off the employer health care stop loss component of this business 
our personal insurance business produced profitable underwriting results in and and highly profitable results in results were more profitable in due in part to a lower impact of catastrophe losses 
the impact of catastrophes accounted for percentage points of the combined loss and expense ratio for our personal business in  compared with percentage points in and percentage points in most of the catastrophe losses in related to storms in the united states  particularly storm sandy 
a significant portion of the catastrophe losses in and also related to storms in the united states  including hurricane irene in results were more profitable in compared with due to better results in our homeowners business  driven mainly by improvement in the current accident year loss ratio excluding catastrophes 
in addition to the higher impact of catastrophes  results were less profitable in compared to due to a higher expense ratio  a higher current accident year loss ratio excluding catastrophes and a lower amount of favorable prior year loss development 
the combined loss and expense ratios for the classes of business within the personal insurance segment were as follows years ended december automobile homeowners other total personal our personal automobile results were profitable in and and highly profitable in results in all three years benefited from moderate claim frequency and favorable prior year loss development 
homeowners results were profitable in  breakeven in and highly profitable in the more profitable results in compared with were due to a lower current accident year loss ratio excluding catastrophes  due in part to lower non catastrophe weather related losses 
the less profitable results in compared with were due in large part to a higher impact of catastrophes  as well as a higher impact of non catastrophe weather related losses 
the impact of catastrophes accounted for percentage points of the combined loss and expense ratio for this class in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in our other personal business produced profitable results in each of the past three years  but more so in the less profitable results in and compared to reflected reduced profitability in the accident and health and excess liability components of this business 
results for our excess liability business  however  were highly profitable in all three years and benefited from favorable prior year loss development  particularly in  as a result of better than expected loss trends 
our yacht business was also highly profitable in each of the past three years 
our accident and health business produced slightly profitable results in compared with breakeven results in and profitable results in

property and marine total commercial in  premium growth in our commercial insurance business was driven by an increase in business written in the united states 
net premiums written outside the united states decreased modestly in compared with  due in part to the negative impact of foreign currency translation 
overall  premium growth for our commercial insurance business reflected improved pricing 
premium growth was limited in several classes of business  however  by a market that remained highly competitive and offered only limited attractive new business opportunities 
the positive overall rate environment  which began in  continued throughout  particularly in the united states 
improvement in the rate environment outside the united states has generally been slower and continued to lag the united states 
average renewal rates in the united states were up significantly in  with increases occurring in all major classes of our business 
average renewal rates outside the united states increased only slightly in retention levels of our existing policyholders remained strong in  but were down from those in  both inside and outside the united states 
the decline in retention was largely due to both our effort to increase rates and our non renewal of some underperforming accounts and some property business in catastrophe exposed areas 
the average renewal exposure change was close to flat in  both inside and outside the united states 
the amount of new business was down in compared with  both inside and outside the united states  as we continued to maintain our underwriting discipline and our focus on obtaining adequate rates in the competitive market 
in  premium growth occurred in all classes of our commercial insurance business 
growth occurred both inside and outside the united states 
premium growth outside the united states benefited modestly from the impact of foreign currency translation 
overall premium growth reflected higher rates  new business opportunities and slightly higher amounts of audit and endorsement premiums in a market that was highly competitive 
in  there was improvement in the overall rate environment  particularly in the united states  throughout the year 
average renewal rates in the united states increased over those in for all major classes of our commercial business 
in  the average renewal exposure change was flat in the united states and up slightly outside the united states 
retention levels of our existing policyholders remained strong and new business volume was up modestly in compared with  driven by activity outside the united states 
our commercial insurance business produced near breakeven underwriting results in and compared to profitable results in results in all three years benefited from favorable loss experience  disciplined risk selection and appropriate terms and conditions in recent years 
the results benefited from a lower current accident year loss ratio excluding catastrophes compared with  but this was largely offset by a reduced amount of favorable prior year reserve development 
the less profitable results in and compared to were mainly due to a higher impact of catastrophes 
the impact of catastrophes accounted for percentage points of the combined loss and expense ratio for our commercial insurance business in  compared with percentage points in and percentage points in the less profitable results in compared with were also due to a higher current accident year loss ratio excluding catastrophes

net premiums written in the united states decreased modestly in both years 
net premiums written outside the united states also decreased in but increased in premium growth in our professional liability business remained constrained in both years by the continuing effects of the economic downturn in recent years and our focus on profitability rather than premium volume in what remains a highly competitive marketplace 
nevertheless  there was improvement in the overall rate environment  particularly in the united states  that began in late and continued throughout during this period  we pursued rate increases on our professional liability business to address margin compression experienced in these classes of business in recent years 
retention levels for this business remained strong  but declined modestly in compared to those in recent years as a result of our rate increase initiative  particularly in the united states 
new business declined in both years in the united states 
new business also declined outside the united states in but was flat in the decline in retention levels and new business volume in is consistent with our desire to selectively reduce our exposure in some customer segments where current rate levels are not attractive  as well as our commitment to maintaining underwriting discipline in this environment 
average renewal rates for our professional liability business were up significantly in the united states in  after declining slightly in the average rate of increase grew throughout the most significant increases in occurred in the directors and officers liability and employment practices liability lines of business 
average renewal rates outside the united states were up slightly in after a modest decline in net premiums written in our surety business declined significantly in and increased only slightly in compared to the respective prior year 
in both years  net premiums written in the united states decreased  due to the effects of the weak economic conditions that resulted in fewer contracts requiring a surety bond being awarded to our existing customers that operate in the construction industry

results for the employment practices liability class were highly unprofitable in compared with near breakeven results in and highly profitable results in the less profitable results in and in this class were due to deterioration in the current accident year loss ratio relative to the respective prior year 
results in also reflected unfavorable prior year loss development  while results in benefited from favorable prior year loss development 
employment practices liability claims have been more numerous and protracted in recent years due primarily to the effect of the economic downturn and higher unemployment levels during that time 
our errors and omissions liability business produced highly unprofitable results in each of the past three years  reflecting unfavorable prior year loss development and generally elevated claim frequency levels in recent years  particularly outside the united states 
collectively  the results for the professional liability classes benefited from favorable prior year loss development in the past three years  but less so in each successive year  driven mainly by positive loss experience related to accident years and prior 
the current accident year combined ratio in our professional liability business was slightly above breakeven in and near breakeven in and the higher current accident year combined ratio in was attributable to adverse loss trends in certain classes within this component of our business 
our surety business produced highly profitable results in each of the past three years due to favorable loss experience 
our surety business tends to be characterized by losses that are infrequent but have the potential to be highly severe 
when losses occur  they are sometimes mitigated by recovery rights to the customer s assets  contract payments  collateral and bankruptcy recoveries 
the majority of our surety obligations are intended to be performance based guarantees 
we manage our exposure by individual account and by specific bond type 
we have substantial commercial and construction surety exposure for current and prior customers  including exposures related to surety bonds issued on behalf of companies that have experienced deterioration in creditworthiness since we issued bonds to them 
we therefore may experience an increase in filed claims and may incur high severity losses  especially in light of ongoing economic conditions 
such losses would be recognized if and when claims are filed and determined to be valid  and could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s results of operations 
reinsurance assumed in  we transferred our ongoing reinsurance assumed business and certain related assets  including renewal rights  to a reinsurance company 
the reinsurer generally did not assume our reinsurance liabilities relating to reinsurance contracts incepting prior to december  we retained those liabilities and the related assets 
for a transition period of about two years  the same reinsurer underwrote specific reinsurance business on our behalf 
we retained a portion of this business and ceded the balance to the reinsurer 
as this business is in runoff  net premiums written from our reinsurance assumed business were not significant during the past three years 
reinsurance assumed results were profitable in each of the past three years 
results in each year benefited from favorable prior year loss development 
catastrophe risk management our property and casualty subsidiaries have exposure to losses caused by natural perils such as hurricanes and other windstorms  earthquakes  severe winter weather and brush fires as well as from man made catastrophic events such as terrorism 
the frequency and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable 

table of contents natural catastrophes the extent of losses from a natural catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in an area affected by the event and the severity of the event 
we regularly assess our concentrations of risk in natural catastrophe exposed areas globally and have strategies and underwriting standards to manage these exposures through individual risk selection  subject to regulatory constraints  and through the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance coverage 
we use catastrophe modeling and a risk concentration management tool to monitor and control our accumulations of potential losses in natural catastrophe exposed areas in the united states  such as california and the gulf and east coasts  as well as in natural catastrophe exposed areas in other countries 
the information provided by the catastrophe modeling and the risk concentration management tool has resulted in our non renewing some accounts and refraining from writing others 
catastrophe modeling generally relies on multiple inputs based on experience  science  engineering and history  and the selection of those inputs requires a significant amount of judgment 
the modeling results may also fail to account for risks that are outside the range of normal probability or are otherwise unforeseen 
because of this  actual results may differ materially from those derived from our modeling exercises 
we also continue to actively explore and analyze credible scientific evidence  including the potential impact of global climate change  that may affect our ability to manage our exposure under the insurance policies we issue as well as the impact that laws and regulations intended to combat climate change may have on us 
despite our efforts to manage our catastrophe exposure  the occurrence of one or more severe natural catastrophic events could have a material effect on the corporation s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
terrorism risk and legislation the september  attack changed the way the property and casualty insurance industry views catastrophic risk 
that tragic event demonstrated that numerous classes of business we write are subject to terrorism related catastrophic risks in addition to the catastrophic risks related to natural occurrences 
this  together with the limited availability of terrorism reinsurance  required us to change how we identify and evaluate risk accumulations 
we have licensed a terrorism model that provides loss estimates under numerous event scenarios 
actual results may differ materially from those suggested by the model 
the risk concentration management tool referred to above also enables us to identify locations and geographic areas that are exposed to risk accumulations 
the information provided by the terrorism model and the risk concentration management tool has resulted in our non renewing some accounts  subject to regulatory constraints  and refraining from writing others 
the terrorism risk insurance act of and more recently  the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of collectively tria  are limited duration programs under which the us federal government has agreed to share the risk of loss arising from certain acts of terrorism with the insurance industry 
the current program  which will terminate on december   is applicable to many lines of commercial business but excludes  among others  commercial automobile  surety and professional liability insurance  other than directors and officers liability 
the current program provides protection from all foreign and domestic acts of terrorism 

table of contents as a precondition to recovery under tria  insurance companies with direct commercial insurance exposure in the united states for tria lines of business are required to make insurance for covered acts of terrorism available under their policies 
in the event of an act of terrorism  each insurer has a separate deductible that it must meet before federal assistance becomes available 
the deductible is based on a percentage of direct us earned premiums for the covered lines of business in the previous calendar year 
for  that deductible is of direct premiums earned in for these lines of business 
for losses above the deductible  the federal government will pay for of covered losses  while the insurer retains 
there is a combined annual aggregate limit for the federal government and all insurers of billion 
if acts of terrorism result in covered losses exceeding the billion annual limit  insurers are not liable for additional losses 
while we expect the provisions of tria will mitigate our exposure in the event of a large scale terrorist attack  our deductible is substantial  approximating billion in for certain classes of business  such as workers compensation  terrorism coverage is mandatory 
for those classes of business where it is not mandatory  policyholders may choose not to purchase terrorism coverage  which would  subject to other statutory or regulatory restrictions  reduce our exposure 
we also have exposure outside the united states to risk of loss from acts of terrorism 
in some jurisdictions  we have access to government mechanisms that would mitigate our exposure 
we will continue to manage this type of catastrophic risk by monitoring terrorism risk aggregations 
nevertheless  given the unpredictability of the targets  frequency and severity of potential terrorist events as well as the very limited terrorism reinsurance coverage available in the market and the limitations of existing government programs and uncertainty regarding their availability in the future  the occurrence of a terrorist event could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
loss reserves unpaid losses and loss expenses  also referred to as loss reserves  are the largest liability of our property and casualty subsidiaries 
our loss reserves include case estimates for claims that have been reported and estimates for claims that have been incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date as well as estimates of the expenses associated with processing and settling all reported and unreported claims  less estimates of anticipated salvage and subrogation recoveries 
estimates are based upon past loss experience modified for current trends as well as prevailing economic  legal and social conditions 
our loss reserves are not discounted to present value 
we regularly review our loss reserves using a variety of actuarial techniques 
we update the reserve estimates as historical loss experience develops  additional claims are reported and or settled and new information becomes available 
any changes in estimates are reflected in operating results in the period in which the estimates are changed 
incurred but not reported ibnr reserve estimates are generally calculated by first projecting the ultimate cost of all claims that have occurred and then subtracting reported losses and loss expenses 
reported losses include cumulative paid losses and loss expenses plus case reserves 
the ibnr reserve includes a provision for claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported to us  some of which are not yet known to the insured  as well as a provision for future development on reported claims 
a relatively large proportion of our net loss reserves  particularly for long tail liability classes  are reserves for ibnr losses 
in fact  about of our aggregate net loss reserves at december  were for ibnr losses 

table of contents our gross case and ibnr loss reserves and related reinsurance recoverable by class of business were as follows gross loss reserves reinsurance recoverable net loss reserves december  case ibnr total in millions personal insurance automobile homeowners other total personal commercial insurance multiple peril casualty workers compensation property and marine total commercial specialty insurance professional liability surety total specialty total insurance reinsurance assumed total gross loss reserves reinsurance recoverable net loss reserves december  case ibnr total in millions personal insurance automobile homeowners other total personal commercial insurance multiple peril casualty workers compensation property and marine total commercial specialty insurance professional liability surety total specialty total insurance reinsurance assumed total 
table of contents loss reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable  increased by million or in the effect of catastrophes increased loss reserves by million 
loss reserves related to our insurance business increased by million 
loss reserves related to our reinsurance assumed business  which is in runoff  decreased by million 
total gross loss reserves related to our insurance business increased by billion in  almost all of which was an increase in ibnr reserves 
the largest increases in gross ibnr reserves were in the homeowners and property and marine classes driven primarily by higher catastrophe related loss reserves attributable to storm sandy 
gross ibnr reserves also increased in the casualty and workers compensation classes  where case reserves increased as well  partly due to increased exposures 
reinsurance recoverable related to our insurance business increased by million in  driven by significant increases in expected recoveries in the homeowners and property and marine classes related to gross losses from storm sandy 
in establishing the loss reserves of our property and casualty subsidiaries  we consider facts currently known and the present state of the law and coverage litigation 
based on all information currently available  we believe that the aggregate loss reserves at december  were adequate to cover claims for losses that had occurred as of that date  including both those known to us and those yet to be reported 
however  as described below  there are significant uncertainties inherent in the loss reserving process 
it is therefore possible that management s estimate of the ultimate liability for losses that had occurred as of december  may change  which could have a material effect on the corporation s results of operations and financial condition 
estimates and uncertainties the process of establishing loss reserves is complex and imprecise as it must take into consideration many variables that are subject to the outcome of future events 
as a result  informed subjective estimates and judgments as to our ultimate exposure to losses are an integral component of our loss reserving process 
given the inherent complexity of the loss reserving process and the potential variability of the assumptions used  the actual emergence of losses could vary  perhaps substantially  from the estimate of losses included in our financial statements  particularly in those instances where settlements do not occur until well into the future 
our net loss reserves at december  were billion 
therefore  a relatively small percentage change in the estimate of net loss reserves would have a material effect on the corporation s results of operations 
reserves other than those relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
our loss reserves include amounts related to short tail and long tail classes of business 
tail refers to the time period between the occurrence of a loss and the settlement of the claim 
the longer the time span between the incidence of a loss and the settlement of the claim  the more the ultimate settlement amount can vary 
short tail classes consist principally of homeowners  commercial property and marine business 
for these classes  claims are generally reported and settled shortly after the loss occurs and the claims usually relate to tangible property 
consequently  the estimation of loss reserves for these classes is less complex 
most of our loss reserves relate to long tail liability classes of business 
long tail classes include directors and officers liability  errors and omissions liability and other professional liability coverages  commercial primary and excess liability  workers compensation and other liability coverages 
for many liability claims significant periods of time  ranging up to several years or more  may elapse between the occurrence of the loss  the reporting of the loss to us and the settlement of the claim 
as a result  loss experience in the more recent accident years for the long tail liability classes has limited statistical credibility because a relatively small proportion of losses in these accident years are reported claims and an even smaller proportion are paid losses 
an accident year is the calendar year in which a loss is incurred or  in the case of claims made policies  the calendar year in which a loss is reported 
liability claims are also more susceptible to 
table of contents litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations and the legal and economic environment 
consequently  the estimation of loss reserves for these classes is more complex and typically subject to a higher degree of variability than for short tail classes 
as a result  the role of judgment is much greater for these reserve estimates 
most of our reinsurance assumed business is long tail casualty reinsurance 
reserve estimates for this business are therefore subject to the variability caused by extended loss emergence periods 
the estimation of loss reserves for this business is further complicated by delays between the time the claim is reported to the ceding insurer and when it is reported by the ceding insurer to us and by our dependence on the quality and consistency of the loss reporting by the ceding company 
our actuaries perform a comprehensive review of loss reserves for each of the numerous classes of business we write at least once a year 
the timing of such review varies by class of business and  for some classes  the jurisdiction in which the policy was written 
the review process takes into consideration the variety of trends that impact the ultimate settlement of claims in each particular class of business 
additionally  each quarter our actuaries review the emergence of paid and reported losses relative to expectations and  as necessary  conduct reserve reviews for particular classes of business 
the loss reserve estimation process relies on the basic assumption that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and likely trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes 
as part of that process  our actuaries use a variety of actuarial methods that analyze experience  trends and other relevant factors 
the principal standard actuarial methods used by our actuaries in the loss reserve reviews include loss development factor methods  expected loss ratio methods  bornheutter ferguson methods and frequency severity methods 
loss development factor methods generally assume that the losses yet to emerge for an accident year are proportional to the paid or reported loss amounts observed so far 
historical patterns of the development of paid and reported losses by accident year can be predictive of the expected future patterns that are applied to current paid and reported losses to generate estimated ultimate losses by accident year 
expected loss ratio methods use loss ratios for prior accident years  adjusted to reflect our evaluation of recent loss trends  the current risk environment  changes in our book of business and changes in our pricing and underwriting  to determine the appropriate expected loss ratio for a given accident year 
the expected loss ratio for each accident year is multiplied by the earned premiums for that year to calculate estimated ultimate losses 
bornheutter ferguson methods are combinations of an expected loss ratio method and a loss development factor method  where the loss development factor method is given more weight as an accident year matures 
frequency severity methods first project ultimate claim counts using one or more of the other methods described above and then multiply those counts by an estimated average claim cost to calculate estimated ultimate losses 
the average claim costs are often estimated through a regression analysis of historical severity data 
generally  these methods work best for high frequency  low severity classes of business 
in completing their loss reserve analysis  our actuaries are required to determine the most appropriate actuarial methods to employ for each class of business 
within each class  the business is further segregated by accident year and  where appropriate  by jurisdiction 
each estimation method has its own pattern  parameter and or judgmental dependencies  with no estimation method being better than the others in all situations 
the relative strengths and weaknesses of the various estimation methods when applied to a particular class of business can also change over time  depending on the underlying circumstances 
in many cases  multiple estimation methods will be valid for the particular facts and circumstances of the relevant class of business 
the manner of application and the degree of reliance on a given method will vary by class of business  by accident year and by jurisdiction based on our actuaries evaluation of the above dependencies and the potential volatility of the loss frequency and severity patterns 
the estimation methods selected or given weight by our actuaries at a particular 
table of contents valuation date are those that are believed to produce the most reliable indication for the loss reserves being evaluated 
these selections incorporate input from claims personnel  pricing actuaries and underwriting management on loss cost trends and other factors that could affect the reserve estimates 
for short tail classes  the emergence of paid and incurred losses generally exhibits a reasonably stable pattern of loss development from one accident year to the next 
thus  for these classes  the loss development factor method is generally relatively straightforward to apply and usually requires only modest extrapolation 
for long tail classes  applying the loss development factor method often requires more judgment in selecting development factors as well as more significant extrapolation 
for those long tail classes with high frequency and relatively low per loss severity eg  workers compensation  volatility will often be sufficiently modest for the loss development factor method to be given significant weight  except in the most recent accident years 
for certain long tail classes of business  however  anticipated loss experience is less predictable because of the small number of claims and erratic claim severity patterns 
these classes include directors and officers liability  errors and omissions liability and commercial excess liability  among others 
for these classes  the loss development factor methods may not produce a reliable estimate of ultimate losses in the most recent accident years since many claims either have not yet been reported to us or are only in the early stages of the settlement process 
therefore  the actuarial estimates for these accident years are based on less extrapolatory methods  such as expected loss ratio and bornheutter ferguson methods 
over time  as a greater number of claims are reported and the statistical credibility of loss experience increases  loss development factor methods are given increasingly more weight 
using all the available data  our actuaries select an indicated loss reserve amount for each class of business based on the various assumptions  projections and methods 
the total indicated reserve amount determined by our actuaries is an aggregate of the indicated reserve amounts for the individual classes of business 
the ultimate outcome is likely to fall within a range of potential outcomes around this indicated amount  but the indicated amount is not expected to be precisely the ultimate liability 
senior management meets with our actuaries at the end of each quarter to review the results of the latest loss reserve analysis 
based on this review  management determines the carried reserve for each class of business 
in making the determination  management considers numerous factors  such as changes in actuarial indications in the period  the maturity of the accident year  trends observed over the recent past and the level of volatility within a particular class of business 
in doing so  management must evaluate whether a change in the data represents credible actionable information or an anomaly 
such an assessment requires considerable judgment 
even if a change is determined to be permanent  it is not always possible to determine the extent of the change until sometime later 
as a result  there can be a time lag between the emergence of a change and a determination that the change should be reflected in the carried loss reserves 
in general  changes are made more quickly to more mature accident years and less volatile classes of business 
among the numerous factors that contribute to the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing loss reserves are the following changes in the inflation rate for goods and services related to covered damages such as medical care and home repair costs  changes in the judicial interpretation of policy provisions relating to the determination of coverage  changes in the general attitude of juries in the determination of liability and damages  legislative actions  changes in the medical condition of claimants  changes in our estimates of the number and or severity of claims that have been incurred but not reported as of the date of the financial statements  
table of contents changes in our book of business  changes in our underwriting standards  and changes in our claim handling procedures 
in addition  we must consider the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as legal  judicial and social conditions change 
these issues have had  and may continue to have  a negative effect on our loss reserves by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims 
examples of such issues include professional liability claims arising out of the recent crisis in the financial markets  directors and officers liability and errors and omissions liability claims arising out of accounting and other corporate malfeasance  and exposure to claims asserted for bodily injury as a result of long term exposure to harmful products or substances 
as a result of issues such as these  the uncertainties inherent in estimating ultimate claim costs on the basis of past experience have grown  further complicating the already complex loss reserving process 
as part of our loss reserving analysis  we take into consideration the various factors that contribute to the uncertainty in the loss reserving process 
those factors that could materially affect our loss reserve estimates include loss development patterns and loss cost trends  rate and exposure level changes  the effects of changes in coverage and policy limits  business mix shifts  the effects of regulatory and legislative developments  the effects of changes in judicial interpretations  the effects of emerging claims and coverage issues and the effects of changes in claim handling practices 
in making estimates of reserves  however  we do not necessarily make an explicit assumption for each of these factors 
moreover  all estimation methods do not utilize the same assumptions and typically no single method is determinative in the reserve analysis for a class of business 
consequently  changes in our loss reserve estimates generally are not the result of changes in any one assumption 
instead  the variability will be affected by the interplay of changes in numerous assumptions  many of which are implicit to the approaches used 
for each class of business  we regularly adjust the assumptions and actuarial methods used in the estimation of loss reserves in response to our actual loss experience as well as our judgments regarding changes in trends and or emerging patterns 
in those instances where we primarily utilize analyses of historical patterns of the development of paid and reported losses  this may be reflected  for example  in the selection of revised loss development factors 
in those long tail classes of business that comprise a majority of our loss reserves and for which loss experience is less predictable due to potential changes in judicial interpretations  potential legislative actions and potential claims issues  this may be reflected in a judgmental change in our estimate of ultimate losses for particular accident years 
the future impact of the various factors that contribute to the uncertainty in the loss reserving process is extremely difficult to predict 
there is potential for significant variation in the development of loss reserves  particularly for long tail classes of business 
we do not derive statistical loss distributions or outcome confidence levels around our loss reserve estimate 
actuarial ranges of reasonable estimates are not a true reflection of the potential volatility between carried loss reserves and the ultimate settlement amount of losses incurred prior to the balance sheet date 
this is due  among other reasons  to the fact that actuarial ranges are developed based on known events as of the valuation date whereas the ultimate disposition of losses is subject to the outcome of events and circumstances that were unknown as of the valuation date 
the following discussion includes disclosure of possible variation from current estimates of loss reserves due to a change in certain key assumptions for particular classes of business 
these impacts are estimated individually  without consideration for any correlation among such assumptions or among lines of business 
therefore  it would be inappropriate to take the amounts and add them together in an attempt to estimate volatility for our loss reserves in total 
we believe that the estimated variation in reserves detailed below is a reasonable estimate of the possible variation that may occur in the future 
however  if such variation did occur  it would likely occur over a period of several years and therefore 
table of contents its impact on the corporation s results of operations would be spread over the same period 
it is important to note  however  that there is the potential for future variation greater than the amounts discussed below 
two of the larger components of our loss reserves relate to the professional liability classes other than fidelity and to commercial excess liability 
the respective reported loss development patterns are key assumptions in estimating loss reserves for these classes of business  both as applied directly to more mature accident years and as applied indirectly eg  via bornheutter ferguson methods to less mature accident years 
reserves for the professional liability classes other than fidelity were billion  net of reinsurance  at december  based on a review of our loss experience  if the loss development factor for each accident year changed such that the cumulative loss development factor for the most recent accident year changed by  we estimate that the net reserves for professional liability classes other than fidelity would change by approximately million  in either direction 
this degree of change in the reported loss development pattern is within the historical variation around the averages in our data 
reserves for commercial excess liability excluding asbestos and toxic waste claims were billion  net of reinsurance  at december  these reserves are included within commercial casualty 
based on a review of our loss experience  if the loss development factor for each accident year changed such that the cumulative loss development factor for the most recent accident year changed by  we estimate that the net reserves for commercial excess liability would change by approximately million  in either direction 
this degree of change in the reported loss development pattern is within the historical variation around the averages in our data 
reserves relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
the estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability 
the insurance industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation over coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures 
reserves for asbestos and toxic waste claims cannot be estimated with traditional actuarial loss reserving techniques that rely on historical accident year loss development factors 
instead  we rely on an exposure based analysis that involves a detailed review of individual policy terms and exposures 
because each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues  we generally evaluate our exposure on a policyholder by policyholder basis  considering a variety of factors that are unique to each policyholder 
quantitative techniques have to be supplemented by subjective considerations including management s judgment 
we establish case reserves and expense reserves for costs of related litigation where sufficient information has been developed to indicate the involvement of a specific insurance policy 
in addition  ibnr reserves are established to cover additional exposures on both known and unasserted claims 
we believe that the loss reserves carried at december  for asbestos and toxic waste claims were adequate 
however  given the judicial decisions and legislative actions that have broadened the scope of coverage and expanded theories of liability in the past and the possibilities of similar interpretations in the future  it is possible that our estimate of loss reserves relating to these exposures may increase in future periods as new information becomes available and as claims develop 
asbestos reserves 
asbestos remains the most significant and difficult mass tort for the insurance industry in terms of claims volume and dollar exposure 
asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injuries asserted by those who came in contact with asbestos or products containing asbestos 
tort theory affecting asbestos litigation has evolved over the years 
early court cases established the continuous trigger theory with respect to insurance coverage 
under this theory  insurance coverage is deemed to be triggered from the time a claimant is first exposed to asbestos until the manifestation of 
table of contents any disease 
this interpretation of a policy trigger can involve insurance policies over many years and increases insurance companies exposure to liability 
until recently  judicial interpretations and legislative actions attempted to maximize insurance availability from both a coverage and liability standpoint 
new asbestos claims and new exposures on existing claims have continued despite the fact that usage of asbestos has declined since the mid s 
many claimants were exposed to multiple asbestos products over an extended period of time 
as a result  claim filings typically name dozens of defendants 
the plaintiffs bar has solicited new claimants through extensive advertising and through asbestos medical screenings 
a vast majority of asbestos bodily injury claims have been filed by claimants who do not show any signs of asbestos related disease 
new asbestos cases are often filed in those jurisdictions with a reputation for judges and juries that are extremely sympathetic to plaintiffs 
approximately manufacturers and distributors of asbestos products have filed for bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos related liabilities 
a bankruptcy sometimes involves an agreement to a plan between the debtor and its creditors  including the creation of a trust to pay current and future asbestos claimants for their injuries 
although the debtor is negotiating in part with its insurers money  insurers are generally given only limited opportunity to be heard 
in addition to contributing to the overall number of claims  bankruptcy proceedings not only result in increased settlement demands against remaining solvent defendants  but also create the potential for recoveries from multiple trusts by the same claimant for the same alleged injuries 
there have been some positive legislative and judicial developments in the asbestos environment over the past several years various challenges to the mass screening of claimants have been mounted  which have led to higher medical evidentiary standards 
for example  several asbestos injury settlement trusts have suspended their acceptance of claims that were based on the diagnosis of specific physicians or screening companies 
further investigations of the medical screening process for asbestos claims are underway 
a number of states have implemented legislative and judicial reforms that focus the courts resources on the claims of the most seriously injured 
those who allege serious injury and can present credible evidence of their injuries are receiving priority trial settings in the courts  while those who have not shown any credible disease manifestation are having their hearing dates delayed or placed on an inactive docket  which preserves the right to pursue litigation in the future 
a number of key jurisdictions have adopted venue reform that requires plaintiffs to have a connection to the jurisdiction in order to file a complaint 
in recognition that many aspects of bankruptcy plans are unfair to certain classes of claimants and to the insurance industry  these plans are being more closely scrutinized by the courts and rejected when appropriate 
a number of jurisdictions have passed or are considering legislation that will require fuller disclosure by plaintiffs of amounts received from asbestos bankruptcy trusts 
our most significant individual asbestos exposures involve products liability on the part of traditional defendants who were engaged in the manufacture  distribution or installation of asbestos products 
we wrote excess liability and or general liability coverages for these insureds 
while these insureds are relatively few in number  their exposure has become substantial due to the increased volume of claims  the erosion of the underlying limits and the bankruptcies of target defendants 
our other asbestos exposures involve products and non products liability on the part of peripheral defendants  including a mix of manufacturers  distributors and installers of certain products that contain asbestos in small quantities and owners or operators of properties where asbestos was present 
generally  these insureds are named defendants on a regional rather than a nationwide basis 
as the 
table of contents financial resources of traditional asbestos defendants have been depleted  plaintiffs are targeting these viable peripheral parties with greater frequency and  in many cases  for large awards 
asbestos claims against the major manufacturers  distributors or installers of asbestos products were typically presented under the products liability section of primary general liability policies as well as under excess liability policies  both of which typically had aggregate limits that capped an insurer s exposure 
in recent years  a number of asbestos claims by insureds are being presented as non products claims  such as those by installers of asbestos products and by property owners or operators who allegedly had asbestos on their property  under the premises or operations section of primary general liability policies 
unlike products exposures  these non products exposures typically had no aggregate limits on coverage  creating potentially greater exposure 
further  in an effort to seek additional insurance coverage  some insureds with installation activities who have substantially eroded their products coverage are presenting new asbestos claims as non products operations claims or attempting to reclassify previously settled products claims as non products claims to restore a portion of previously exhausted products aggregate limits 
it is difficult to predict whether insureds will be successful in asserting claims under non products coverage or whether insurers will be successful in asserting additional defenses 
accordingly  the ultimate cost to insurers of the claims for coverage not subject to aggregate limits is uncertain 
in establishing our asbestos reserves  we evaluate the exposure presented by each insured 
as part of this evaluation  we consider a variety of factors including the available insurance coverage  limits and deductibles  the jurisdictions involved  the number of claimants  the disease mix exhibited by the claimants  the past settlement values of similar claims  the potential role of other insurance  particularly underlying coverage below our excess liability policies  potential bankruptcy impact  relevant judicial interpretations  and applicable coverage defenses  including asbestos exclusions 
various us federal proposals to solve the ongoing asbestos litigation crisis have been considered by the us congress over the years  but none have yet been enacted 
the prospect of federal asbestos reform legislation remains uncertain 
as a result  we have assumed a continuation of the current legal environment with no benefit from any federal asbestos reform legislation 
our actuaries and claim personnel perform periodic analyses of our asbestos related exposures 
the analyses during and noted modest adverse developments related to a small number of accounts 
based on these developments  we increased our net asbestos loss reserves by million in and million in the analyses during noted no significant developments that required a change in our estimate of ultimate liabilities related to asbestos claims 
the following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending loss reserves related to asbestos claims 
years ended december in millions gross loss reserves  beginning of year reinsurance recoverable  beginning of year net loss reserves  beginning of year net incurred losses net losses paid net loss reserves  end of year reinsurance recoverable  end of year gross loss reserves  end of year at december   million of the net asbestos loss reserves were ibnr reserves 

table of contents the following table presents the number of policyholders for whom we have open asbestos case reserves and the related net loss reserves at december  as well as the net losses paid during by component 
number of policyholders net loss reserves net losses paid in millions traditional defendants peripheral defendants and all other future claims from unknown policyholders significant uncertainty remains as to our ultimate liability related to asbestos related claims 
this uncertainty is due to several factors including the long latency period between asbestos exposure and disease manifestation and the resulting potential for involvement of multiple policy periods for individual claims  plaintiffs expanding theories of liability and increased focus on peripheral defendants  the volume of claims by unimpaired plaintiffs and the extent to which they can be precluded from making claims  the volume of claims by severely impaired plaintiffs  such as those with mesothelioma  and the size of settlements and judgments received by those plaintiffs  the efforts by insureds to claim the right to non products coverage not subject to aggregate limits  the number of insureds seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos related liabilities  the ability of claimants to bring a claim in a state in which they have no residency or exposure  the impact of the exhaustion of primary limits and the resulting increase in claims on excess liability policies we have issued  inconsistent court decisions and diverging legal interpretations  and the possibility  however remote  of federal legislation that would address the asbestos problem 
these significant uncertainties are not likely to be resolved in the near future 
toxic waste reserves 
toxic waste claims relate primarily to pollution and related cleanup costs 
our insureds have two potential areas of exposure hazardous waste dump sites and pollution at the insured site primarily from underground storage tanks and manufacturing processes 
the us federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of superfund has been interpreted to impose strict  retroactive and joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties prps for the cost of remediating hazardous waste sites 
most sites have multiple prps 
most prps named to date are parties who have been generators  transporters  past or present landowners or past or present site operators 
these prps had proper government authorization in many instances 
however  relative fault has not been a factor in establishing liability 
while the volume of new claims is significantly reduced from the activity in the s  prps continue to tender claims to insurers on newly identified hazardous waste sites 
insurance policies issued to prps were not intended to cover claims arising from gradual pollution 
since  most policies have specifically excluded such exposures 
environmental remediation claims tendered by prps and others to insurers have frequently resulted in disputes over insurers contractual obligations with respect to pollution claims 
the resulting litigation against insurers extends to issues of liability  coverage and other policy provisions 

table of contents there is substantial uncertainty involved in estimating our liabilities related to these claims 
first  the liabilities of the claimants are extremely difficult to estimate 
at any given waste site  the allocation of remediation costs among governmental authorities and the prps varies greatly depending on a variety of factors 
second  different courts have addressed liability and coverage issues regarding pollution claims and have reached inconsistent conclusions in their interpretation of several issues 
these significant uncertainties are not likely to be resolved definitively in the near future 
uncertainties also remain as to the superfund law itself 
superfund s taxing authority expired on december  and has not been re enacted 
federal legislation appears to be at a standstill 
at this time  it is not possible to predict the direction that any reforms may take  when they may occur or the effect that any changes may have on the insurance industry 
without federal movement on superfund reform  the enforcement of superfund liability has occasionally shifted to the states 
states are being forced to reconsider state level cleanup statutes and regulations 
as individual states move forward  the potential for conflicting state regulation becomes greater 
in a few states  we have seen cases brought against insureds or directly against insurance companies for environmental pollution and natural resources damages 
to date  only a few natural resource claims have been filed and they are being vigorously defended 
significant uncertainty remains as to the cost of remediating the state sites 
because of the large number of state sites  such sites could prove even more costly in the aggregate than superfund sites 
in establishing our toxic waste reserves  we evaluate the exposure presented by each insured 
as part of this evaluation  we consider a variety of factors including the probable liability  available insurance coverage  past settlement values of similar claims  relevant judicial interpretations  applicable coverage defenses as well as facts that are unique to each insured 
in each of the past three years  the analysis of our toxic waste exposures indicated that some of our insureds had become responsible for the remediation of additional polluted sites and that  as clean up standards continue to evolve as a result of technology advances  the estimated cost of remediation of certain sites had increased 
defense costs associated with some of these cases have also increased 
based on these developments  we increased our net toxic waste loss reserves by million in  million in and million in the following table presents a reconciliation of our beginning and ending loss reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable  related to toxic waste claims 
the reinsurance recoverable related to these claims is minimal 
years ended december in millions reserves  beginning of year incurred losses losses paid reserves  end of year at december   million of the net toxic waste loss reserves were ibnr reserves 
reinsurance recoverable 
reinsurance recoverable is the estimated amount recoverable from reinsurers related to the losses we have incurred 
at december   reinsurance recoverable included million recoverable with respect to paid losses and loss expenses  which is included in other assets  and billion recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses  including reinsurance losses incurred but not reported 
approximately million of reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses at december  related to losses associated with storm sandy 
none of the reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses is currently due for collection 

table of contents reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses represents an estimate of the portion of our gross loss reserves that will be recovered from reinsurers 
such reinsurance recoverable is estimated as part of our loss reserving process using assumptions that are consistent with the assumptions used in estimating the gross loss reserves 
consequently  the estimation of reinsurance recoverable is subject to similar judgments and uncertainties as the estimation of gross loss reserves 
ceded reinsurance contracts do not relieve us of our primary obligation to our policyholders 
consequently  an exposure exists with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations or disputes the liabilities we believe it has assumed under the reinsurance contracts 
we are selective in regard to our reinsurers  placing reinsurance with only those reinsurers that we believe have strong balance sheets and superior underwriting ability 
we monitor the financial strength of our reinsurers and our concentration of risk with reinsurers on an ongoing basis 
we obtain collateral from certain of our reinsurers in the form of letters of credit  trust agreements and cash advances  in order to mitigate potential collectibility exposure 
the total amount of collateral held at december  related to reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid losses and loss expenses was million 
as of december   the largest amount of reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid losses and loss expenses from any individual reinsurer represented less than of shareholders equity 
nevertheless  in recent years  certain of our reinsurers have experienced financial difficulties or exited the reinsurance business 
in addition  we may become involved in coverage disputes with our reinsurers 
a provision for estimated uncollectible reinsurance is recorded based on periodic evaluations of balances due from reinsurers  the financial condition of the reinsurers  coverage disputes and other relevant factors  including collateral held 
prior year loss development changes in loss reserve estimates are unavoidable because such estimates are subject to the outcome of future events 
loss trends vary and time is required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed 
reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening 
reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development or reserve releases 
a reconciliation of our beginning and ending loss reserves  net of reinsurance  for the three years ended december  is as follows years ended december in millions net loss reserves  beginning of year net incurred losses and loss expenses related to current year prior years net payments for losses and loss expenses related to current year prior years foreign currency translation effect net loss reserves  end of year 
table of contents during  we experienced overall favorable prior year development of million  which represented of the net loss reserves as of december  this compares with favorable prior year development of million during  which represented of the net loss reserves at december   and favorable prior year development of million during  which represented of the net loss reserves at december  such favorable development was reflected in operating results in these respective years 
the following table presents the overall prior year loss development for the three years ended december  by accident year 
calendar year favorable unfavorable development accident year in millions and prior the net favorable development of million in was due to various factors the most significant factors were we experienced favorable development of about million in the aggregate in the personal and commercial liability classes 
the most significant favorable development occurred in accident years to  which more than offset adverse development in accident years and prior  which included million of incurred losses related to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
the overall frequency and severity of prior period liability claims were lower than expected and the effects of underwriting changes that affected these years have been more positive than expected  especially in the commercial excess liability class 
these factors were reflected in the determination of the carried loss reserves for these classes at december  we experienced overall favorable development of about million in the professional liability classes other than fidelity 
this favorable development was driven by the directors and officers liability and fiduciary liability classes  partially offset by adverse development in the errors and omissions liability and employment practices liability classes 
overall  the reported loss activity was less than expected  with aggregate favorable emergence from accident years and prior partly offset by some adverse emergence in the more recent accident years 
this development was recognized as one among many factors in the determination of loss reserves at december  among other important factors were the continued uncertainty from the crisis in the financial markets and its aftermath  the effects of the ensuing economic downturn and other recent industry litigation dynamics  as well as the reversal in of the previous general downward trend in prices 
we experienced favorable development of about million in the aggregate in the personal and commercial property classes  mostly related to the through accident years 
the severity and frequency of late developing property claims that emerged during were lower than expected  including those related to catastrophes  and the development of existing case reserves was more favorable than expected 
because the incidence of large property losses is subject to a considerable element of fortuity  reserve estimates for these claims are based on an 
table of contents analysis of past loss experience on average over a period of years 
as a result  this factor had a relatively modest effect on our determination of carried property loss reserves at december  we experienced unfavorable development of about million in the fidelity class due to higher than expected reported loss emergence  related mostly to accident years through loss reserve estimates at the end of included an expectation of less prior year loss activity than actually occurred in this activity was driven by case developments on a relatively small number of claims related to the recent economic and financial environment 
this continued adverse development was reflected in the determination of carried fidelity loss reserves at december  we experienced favorable development of about million in the runoff of our reinsurance assumed business due primarily to better than expected reported loss activity from cedants 
we experienced favorable development of about million in the personal automobile business due primarily to lower than expected frequency of prior period claims 
this factor was reflected in our determination of carried loss reserves for this business at december  we experienced favorable development of about million in the surety business due to lower than expected loss emergence in recent accident years 
loss reserve estimates at the end of included an expectation of more late reported losses than actually occurred in however  since the experience in this business is volatile and we would still expect such losses to occur over time  the favorable development in was given only modest weight in our determination of carried surety loss reserves at december  the net favorable development of million in was also due to various factors

in item of this report  we present an analysis of our consolidated loss reserve development on a calendar year basis for each of the ten years prior to the variability in reserve development over the ten year period illustrates the uncertainty of the loss reserving process 
conditions and trends that have affected reserve development in the past will not necessarily recur in the future 
it is not appropriate to extrapolate future favorable or unfavorable reserve development based on amounts experienced in prior years 
our us property and casualty subsidiaries are required to file annual statements with insurance regulatory authorities prepared on an accounting basis prescribed or permitted by such authorities 
these annual statements include an analysis of loss reserves  referred to as schedule p  that presents accident year loss development information by line of business for the nine years prior to it is our intention to post the schedule p for our combined us property and casualty subsidiaries on our website as soon as it becomes available 
investment results property and casualty investment income before taxes decreased by in compared with and was flat in compared with in  the decrease was primarily due to a modest decline in average yields on our investment portfolio 
in  the slightly positive impact of currency fluctuation 
table of contents on income from our investments denominated in currencies other than the us dollar was offset by the impact of lower average yields on our investment portfolio 
in and  the decrease in the average yield of our investment portfolio primarily resulted from lower reinvestment yields on fixed maturity securities that matured  were redeemed by the issuer or were sold during the year 
growth in property and casualty investment income before taxes was limited as a result of our property and casualty subsidiaries holding a similar amount of average invested assets in  and despite the substantial operating cash generated during each of the past three years  average invested assets were similar in the three years as a result of substantial dividends distributed by the property and casualty subsidiaries to chubb during the period 
the effective tax rate on our investment income was in compared with in and in the effective tax rate fluctuates as the proportion of tax exempt investment income relative to total investment income changes from period to period 
on an after tax basis  property and casualty investment income decreased by compared to and was flat in compared to the after tax annualized yield on the investment portfolio that supports our property and casualty insurance business was in compared with in and in if both investment yields and average foreign currency to us dollar exchange rates are similar in to year end levels  property and casualty investment income after taxes for is expected to decline 
this expected decline results from the effect of investing funds from securities that matured in in securities with yields lower than the yields of the maturing securities  and the expectation that this pattern will continue in the expected decline includes the positive impact of a slightly higher amount of average invested assets estimated to be held during  based on expectations of cash flows during the year 
other income and charges other income and charges  which includes miscellaneous income and expenses of the property and casualty subsidiaries  was income of million in compared with income of million and million in and  respectively 
the income in and primarily included income from several small property and casualty insurance companies in which we have an interest 
corporate and other corporate and other comprises investment income earned on corporate invested assets  interest expense and other expenses not allocated to our operating subsidiaries and the results of our non insurance subsidiaries 
corporate and other produced a loss before taxes of million in compared with losses of million and million in and  respectively 
the lower loss in compared to was primarily due to lower interest expense resulting from the repayment of million of outstanding notes upon maturity in november the higher loss in compared to was primarily due to lower investment income in investment income in included a million special dividend received on an equity security investment 
chubb financial solutions chubb financial solutions cfs  a wholly owned subsidiary of chubb  participated in derivative financial instruments and has been in runoff since since that date  cfs has terminated early or run off nearly all of its contractual obligations under its derivative contracts 
at december   cfs s remaining derivative contracts were insignificant 
a derivative contract linked to an equity market index terminated in  as expected 
cfs s aggregate exposure  or retained risk  from its remaining derivative contracts is referred to as notional amount 
notional amounts are used to calculate the exchange of contractual cash flows and are not necessarily representative of the potential for gain or loss 
notional amounts are not recorded on the balance sheet 

table of contents the notional amount under the remaining contracts was about million and we estimate the fair value of our future obligations was about million at december  realized investment gains and losses net realized investment gains and losses were as follows years ended december in millions net realized gains losses fixed maturities equity securities other invested assets other than temporary impairment losses fixed maturities equity securities realized investment gains before tax realized investment gains after tax decisions to sell equity securities and fixed maturities are governed principally by considerations of investment opportunities and tax consequences 
as a result  realized gains and losses on the sale of these investments may vary significantly from period to period 
however  such gains and losses generally have little  if any  impact on shareholders equity as all of these investments are carried at fair value  with the unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the net realized gains and losses of other invested assets represent primarily the aggregate of realized gain distributions to us from the limited partnerships in which we have an interest and changes in our equity in the net assets of those partnerships based on valuations provided to us by the manager of each partnership 
due to the timing of our receipt of valuation data from the investment managers  the value of these investments and any related realized gains and losses are generally reported on a one quarter lag 
the net realized gains of the limited partnerships reported in primarily reflected the strong performance of the us equity and high yield investment markets in the first and third quarters of  partially offset by the negative performance of several non us equity markets  particularly in asia  in the fourth quarter of and the global equity markets in the second quarter of the net realized gains of the limited partnerships reported in reflected the strong performance of the equity and high yield investment markets in the fourth quarter of and in the first quarter of we regularly review invested assets that have a fair value less than cost to determine if an other than temporary decline in value has occurred 
we have a monitoring process overseen by a committee of investment and accounting professionals that is responsible for identifying those securities to be specifically evaluated for a potential other than temporary impairment 
the determination of whether a decline in value of any investment is temporary or other than temporary requires the judgment of management 
the assessment of other than temporary impairment of fixed maturities and equity securities is based on both quantitative criteria and qualitative information 
a number of factors are considered including  but not limited to  the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  whether the issuer is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments  general market conditions and industry or sector specific factors 
the decision to recognize a decline in the value of a security carried at fair value as other than temporary rather than temporary has no impact on shareholders equity 

table of contents in determining whether fixed maturities are other than temporarily impaired  we are required to recognize an other than temporary impairment loss when we conclude that we have the intent to sell or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell an impaired fixed maturity before the security recovers to its amortized cost value or it is likely we will not recover the entire amortized cost value of an impaired security 
if we have the intent to sell or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell an impaired fixed maturity before the security recovers to its amortized cost value  the security is written down to fair value and the entire amount of the writedown is included in net income as a realized investment loss 
for all other impaired fixed maturities  when the impairment is determined to be other than temporary  the impairment loss is separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount representing the loss related to all other factors 
the amount of the impairment loss that represents the credit loss is included in net income as a realized investment loss and the amount of the impairment loss that relates to all other factors is included in other comprehensive income 
in determining whether equity securities are other than temporarily impaired  we consider our intent and ability to hold a security for a period of time sufficient to allow us to recover our cost 
if a decline in the fair value of an equity security is deemed to be other than temporary  the security is written down to fair value and the amount of the writedown is included in net income as a realized investment loss 
during each of the last three years  the fair value of some of our investments were at a level below our cost 
some of these investments were deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 
in  about of the other than temporary impairment losses recognized for equity securities related to issuers in the financial services industry 
the remainder of the other than temporary impairment losses in and the other than temporary impairment losses in and related to issuers that were not concentrated within any individual industry or sector

capital resources and liquidity capital resources and liquidity represent a company s overall financial strength and its ability to generate cash flows  borrow funds at competitive rates and raise new capital to meet operating and growth needs 
capital resources capital resources provide protection for policyholders  furnish the financial strength to support the business of underwriting insurance risks and facilitate continued business growth 
at december   the corporation had shareholders equity of billion and total debt of billion 
chubb has outstanding million of notes due in  million of notes and million of debentures due in  million of debentures due in  million of notes due in and million of notes due in  all of which are unsecured 
chubb also has outstanding billion of unsecured junior subordinated capital securities that will become due on april   the scheduled maturity date  but only to the extent that chubb has received sufficient net proceeds from the sale of certain qualifying capital securities 
chubb must use its commercially reasonable efforts  subject to certain market disruption events  to sell enough qualifying capital securities to permit repayment of the capital securities on the scheduled maturity date or as soon thereafter as possible 
any remaining outstanding principal amount will be due on march   the final maturity date 
the capital securities bear interest at a fixed rate of through april  thereafter  the capital securities will bear interest at a rate equal to the three month libor rate plus 
subject to certain conditions  chubb has the right to defer the payment of interest on the capital securities for a period not exceeding ten consecutive years 
during any such period  interest will continue to accrue and chubb generally may not declare or pay any dividends on or purchase any shares of its capital stock 

table of contents in connection with the issuance of the capital securities  chubb entered into a replacement capital covenant in which it agreed that it will not repay  redeem or purchase the capital securities before march   unless  subject to certain limitations  it has received proceeds from the sale of specified replacement capital securities 
subject to the replacement capital covenant  the capital securities may be redeemed  in whole or in part  at any time on or after april  at a redemption price equal to the principal amount plus any accrued interest on or prior to april  at a redemption price equal to the greater of i the principal amount or ii a make whole amount  in each case plus any accrued interest 
management regularly monitors the corporation s capital resources 
in connection with our long term capital strategy  chubb from time to time contributes capital to its property and casualty subsidiaries 
in addition  in order to satisfy capital needs as a result of any rating agency capital adequacy or other future rating issues  or in the event we were to need additional capital to make strategic investments in light of market opportunities  we may take a variety of actions  which could include the issuance of additional debt and or equity securities 
we believe that our strong financial position and current debt level provide us with the flexibility and capacity to obtain funds externally through debt or equity financings on both a short term and long term basis 
in  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares  of chubb s common stock 
in june  the board of directors authorized an increase of  shares of common stock to the authorization approved in in december  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional  shares of common stock 
in january  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to billion of chubb s common stock 
in  we repurchased  shares of chubb s common stock in open market transactions at a cost of  million 
in  we repurchased  shares of chubb s common stock in open market transactions at a cost of  million 
in  we repurchased  shares of chubb s common stock in open market transactions at a cost of million 
as of december   million remained under the january share repurchase authorization 
in january  we repurchased  shares under the january authorization at a cost of million 
on january   the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to billion of chubb s common stock which replaced the january authorization 
the authorization has no expiration date 
we expect to complete the repurchase of shares under this authorization by the end of january  subject to market conditions and other factors 
ratings chubb and its property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are rated by major rating agencies 
these ratings reflect the rating agency s opinion of our financial strength  operating performance  strategic position and ability to meet our obligations to policyholders 
credit ratings assess a company s ability to make timely payments of interest and principal on its debt 
financial strength ratings assess an insurer s ability to meet its financial obligations to policyholders 
ratings are an important factor in establishing our competitive position in the insurance markets 
there can be no assurance that our ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be changed 
it is possible that one or more of the rating agencies may raise or lower our existing ratings in the future 
if our credit ratings were downgraded  we might incur higher borrowing costs and might have more limited means to access capital 
a downgrade in our financial strength ratings could adversely affect the competitive position of our insurance operations  including a possible reduction in demand for our products in certain markets 

table of contents liquidity liquidity is a measure of a company s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short and long term cash requirements of its business operations 
the corporation s liquidity requirements in the past have generally been met by funds from operations and we expect that in the future funds from operations will continue to be sufficient to meet such requirements 
liquidity requirements could also be met by funds received upon the maturity or sale of marketable securities in our investment portfolio 
the corporation also has the ability to borrow under its million credit facility and we believe we could issue debt or equity securities 
our property and casualty operations provide liquidity in that insurance premiums are generally received months or even years before losses are paid under the policies purchased by such premiums 
cash receipts from operations  consisting of insurance premiums and investment income  provide funds to pay losses  operating expenses and dividends to chubb 
after satisfying our cash requirements  excess cash flows are used to build the investment portfolio with the expectation of generating increased future investment income 
our strong underwriting and investment results generated substantial operating cash flows in in  cash provided by the property and casualty subsidiaries operating activities increased approximately million compared to primarily as a result of higher premium collections and lower loss payments 
in  cash provided by the property and casualty subsidiaries operating activities exceeded the cash used for financing activities primarily the payment of dividends to chubb by approximately million 
in  dividends paid to chubb by the property and casualty subsidiaries decreased by million compared to in and  our underwriting and investment results also generated substantial operating cash flows 
in  cash provided by the property and casualty subsidiaries operating activities declined compared to primarily as a result of higher loss payments partially offset by higher premium collections 
in  the cash used by the property and casualty subsidiaries for financing activities primarily the payment of dividends to chubb exceeded the cash provided by operating activities by approximately million 
in  dividends paid to chubb by the property and casualty subsidiaries increased by million compared to in  the cash provided by the property and casualty subsidiaries operating activities exceeded the cash used for financing activities primarily the payment of dividends to chubb by approximately million 
our property and casualty subsidiaries maintain substantial investments in highly liquid  short term marketable securities 
accordingly  we do not anticipate selling long term fixed maturity investments to meet any liquidity needs 
chubb s liquidity requirements primarily include the payment of dividends to shareholders and interest and principal on debt obligations 
the declaration and payment of future dividends to chubb s shareholders will be at the discretion of chubb s board of directors and will depend upon many factors  including our operating results  financial condition  capital requirements and any regulatory constraints 
as a holding company  chubb s ability to continue to pay dividends to shareholders and to satisfy its debt obligations relies on the availability of liquid assets  which is dependent in large part on the dividend paying ability of its property and casualty subsidiaries 
the timing and amount of dividends paid by the property and casualty subsidiaries to chubb may vary from year to year 
our property and casualty subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate that restrict the amount and timing of dividends they may pay within twelve consecutive months without the prior approval of regulatory authorities 
the restrictions are generally based on net income and on certain levels of policyholders surplus as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices 
dividends in excess of such thresholds are considered extraordinary and require prior regulatory approval 

table of contents the maximum dividend distributions that the property and casualty subsidiaries could have paid to chubb during  and without prior approval were approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively 
during  and these subsidiaries paid dividends to chubb of billion  billion and billion  respectively 
included in the dividends paid in  and were million  billion and billion  respectively  of dividends deemed to be extraordinary under applicable insurance regulations due to the limitation on the amount of dividends that may be paid within twelve consecutive months 
regulatory approval was required and obtained for the payment of these dividends 
whether any dividends the property and casualty subsidiaries may pay in require regulatory approval will depend on the amount and timing of the dividend payments 
the maximum aggregate dividend distribution that may be made by the subsidiaries to chubb during without prior regulatory approval is approximately billion 
in september  chubb entered into a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that provides for up to million of unsecured borrowings 
the revolving credit facility is available for general corporate purposes 
the agreement has a maturity date of september  various interest rate options are available to chubb  all of which are based on market interest rates 
the agreement contains customary restrictive covenants  including a covenant to maintain a minimum adjusted consolidated shareholders equity 
at december   chubb was in compliance with all such covenants 
chubb is permitted to request an increase in the credit available under the agreement  no more than two times per year  up to a maximum facility amount of million 
chubb is permitted to request on two occasions  at any time during the term of the agreement  an extension of the maturity date for an additional one year period 
there have been no borrowings under this agreement 
on the maturity date of the agreement  any borrowings then outstanding become payable 
a previous five year million revolving credit agreement that would have expired in october was terminated in september in connection with the new revolving credit agreement 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following table provides our future payments due by period under contractual obligations as of december   aggregated by type of obligation 
and and thereafter total in millions principal due under long term debt interest payments on long term debt a purchase obligations b future minimum rental payments under operating leases loss and loss expense reserves c total a junior subordinated capital securities of billion bear interest at a fixed rate of through april  and at a rate equal to the three month libor rate plus thereafter 
for purposes of the above table  interest after april  was calculated using the three month libor rate as of december  the table includes future interest payments through the scheduled maturity date  april  interest payments for the period from the scheduled maturity date through the final maturity date  march   would increase the contractual obligation by million 
it is our expectation that the capital securities will be redeemed at the end of the fixed interest rate period 
b includes agreements with vendors to purchase various goods and services such as information technology  human resources and administrative services 

table of contents c there is typically no stated contractual commitment associated with property and casualty insurance loss reserves 
the obligation to pay a claim arises only when a covered loss event occurs and a settlement is reached 
the vast majority of our loss reserves relate to claims for which settlements have not yet been reached 
our loss reserves therefore represent estimates of future payments 
these estimates are dependent on the outcome of claim settlements that will occur over many years 
accordingly  the payment of the loss reserves is not fixed as to either amount or timing 
the estimate of the timing of future payments is based on our historical loss payment patterns 
the ultimate amount and timing of loss payments will likely differ from our estimate and the differences could be material 
we expect that these loss payments will be funded  in large part  by future cash receipts from operations 
the above table excludes certain commitments totaling approximately million at december  to fund limited partnership investments 
these commitments can be called by the partnerships generally over a period of five years or less  if and when needed by the partnerships to fund certain partnership expenses or the purchase of investments 
it is uncertain whether and  if so  when we will be required to fund these commitments 
there is no predetermined payment schedule 
the corporation does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the corporation s financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or capital resources  other than as disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
invested assets the main objectives in managing our investment portfolios are to maximize after tax investment income and total investment return while managing credit risk and interest rate risk in order to ensure that funds will be available to meet our insurance obligations 
investment strategies are developed based on many factors including underwriting results and our resulting tax position  regulatory requirements  fluctuations in interest rates and consideration of other market risks 
investment decisions are centrally managed by investment professionals based on guidelines established by management and approved by the boards of directors of chubb and its respective operating companies 
our investment portfolio primarily comprises high quality bonds  principally tax exempt securities  corporate bonds  mortgage backed securities and us treasury securities  as well as foreign government and corporate bonds that support our operations outside the united states 
the portfolio also includes equity securities  primarily publicly traded common stocks  and other invested assets  primarily private equity limited partnerships  all of which are held with the primary objective of capital appreciation 
limited partnership investments by their nature are less liquid and may involve more risk than other investments 
we actively manage our risk through type of asset class and domestic and international diversification 
at december   we had investments in about separate partnerships 
we review the performance of these investments on a quarterly basis and we obtain audited financial statements annually 
during  we increased our holdings of corporate bonds and we reduced our holdings of tax exempt fixed maturities and mortgage backed securities 
during  cash used for financing activities exceeded cash provided by operating activities 
as a result  our holdings of tax exempt fixed maturities and mortgage backed securities both decreased slightly during the year  partly offset by a slight increase in our holdings of corporate bonds 
in  we increased our holdings of tax exempt fixed maturities and we reduced our holdings of mortgage backed securities 
our objective is to achieve the appropriate mix of taxable and tax exempt securities in our portfolio to balance both investment and tax strategies 
at december   of our us fixed maturity portfolio was invested in tax exempt securities compared with and at december  and december   respectively 
we classify our fixed maturity securities  which may be sold prior to maturity to support our investment strategies  such as in response to changes in interest rates and the yield curve or to maximize after tax returns  as available for sale 
fixed maturities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value 

table of contents changes in the general interest rate environment affect the returns available on new fixed maturity investments 
while a rising interest rate environment enhances the returns available on new investments  it reduces the fair value of existing fixed maturity investments and thus the availability of gains on disposition 
a decline in interest rates reduces the returns available on new investments but increases the fair value of existing investments  creating the opportunity for realized investment gains on disposition 
the net unrealized appreciation before tax of our fixed maturities and equity securities carried at fair value was billion at december   billion at december  and billion at december  such unrealized appreciation is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of applicable deferred income taxes 
in and  market yields on fixed maturity investments declined  resulting in an increase in the fair value of many of our fixed maturity investments 
fair values of financial instruments fair values of financial instruments are determined by management using valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
fair values are generally measured using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities or other inputs  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities that are observable  either directly or indirectly 
in those instances where observable inputs are not available  fair values are measured using unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
unobservable inputs reflect our own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
fair value estimates derived from unobservable inputs are affected by the assumptions used  including the discount rates and the estimated amounts and timing of future cash flows 
the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would be realized in a current market exchange 
the fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels as follows level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments 
level other inputs that are observable for the financial instrument  either directly or indirectly 
level significant unobservable inputs 
the methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values of financial instruments are as follows fair values for fixed maturities are determined by management  utilizing prices obtained from a third party  nationally recognized pricing service or  in the case of securities for which prices are not provided by a pricing service  from third party brokers 
for fixed maturities that have quoted prices in active markets  market quotations are provided 
for fixed maturities that do not trade on a daily basis  the pricing service and brokers provide fair value estimates using a variety of inputs including  but not limited to  benchmark yields  reported trades  broker dealer quotes  issuer spreads  bids  offers  reference data  prepayment rates and measures of volatility 
management reviews on an ongoing basis the reasonableness of the methodologies used by the relevant pricing service and brokers 
in addition  management  using the prices received for the securities from the pricing service and brokers  determines the aggregate portfolio price performance and reviews it against applicable indices 
if management believes that significant discrepancies exist  it will discuss these with the relevant pricing service or broker to resolve the discrepancies 
fair values of equity securities are determined by management  utilizing quoted market prices 
fair values of warrants are determined by management  utilizing an option pricing model 
the carrying value of short term investments approximates fair value due to the short maturities of these investments 

table of contents fair values of long term debt issued by chubb are determined by management  utilizing prices obtained from a third party  nationally recognized pricing service 
a pricing service provides fair value amounts for approximately of our fixed maturities 
the prices we obtain from a pricing service and brokers generally are non binding  but are reflective of current market transactions in the applicable financial instruments 
at december  and december   we held an insignificant amount of financial instruments in our investment portfolio for which a lack of market liquidity impacted our determination of fair value 
the methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the corporation s pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan assets  other than assets invested in pooled funds  are similar to the methods and assumptions used for our other financial instruments 
the fair value of pooled funds is based on the net asset value of the funds 
at december  and december   approximately of the pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan assets are categorized as level or level in the fair value hierarchy 
pension and other postretirement benefits in  the liability related to our pension and other postretirement plans increased  primarily as a result of actuarial losses attributable to the decline in the discount rates used to value our pension and other postretirement obligations  partially offset by an increase in the fair value of the assets held by our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in excess of the expected return on plan assets 
postretirement benefits costs not recognized in net income increased by million  which was reflected in other comprehensive income  net of applicable deferred income taxes 
the liability related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans increased in  primarily as a result of actuarial losses attributable to a decline in the discount rates used to value our pension and other postretirement obligations  and lower than expected return on plan assets 
in  the liability related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans decreased 
postretirement benefit costs not recognized in net income increased by million in and decreased by million in  which were reflected in other comprehensive income  net of applicable deferred income taxes 
employee benefits are discussed further in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
change in accounting principle effective january   the corporation adopted new guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board related to the accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts 
the guidance identifies those costs relating to the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts that should be capitalized 
the corporation elected retrospective application of this guidance under which deferred policy acquisition costs and related deferred income tax liabilities were reduced as of the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements  offset by a cumulative effect adjustment that reduced retained earnings 
the adoption of this guidance decreased deferred policy acquisition costs by million  decreased deferred income tax liabilities by million and decreased shareholders equity by million as of january  the effect of the adoption of the new guidance on net income for the years ended december   and was not material 
the change in accounting is discussed further in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
our primary exposure to market risks relates to our investment portfolio  which is sensitive to changes in interest rates and  to a lesser extent  credit quality  prepayment  foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 
we also have exposure to market risks through our debt obligations 
analytical tools and monitoring systems are in place to assess each of these elements of market risk 

table of contents investment portfolio interest rate risk interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of a security that promises a fixed return to changes in interest rates 
when market interest rates rise  the fair value of our fixed income securities decreases 
we view the potential changes in price of our fixed income investments within the overall context of asset and liability management 
our actuaries estimate the payout pattern of our liabilities  primarily our property and casualty loss reserves  to determine their duration 
expressed in years  duration is the weighted average payment period of cash flows  where the weighting is based on the present value of the cash flows 
we set duration targets for our fixed income investment portfolios after consideration of the estimated duration of these liabilities and other factors  which allows us to prudently manage the overall effect of interest rate risk for the corporation 
the following table provides information about our fixed maturity securities  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents cash flows of principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates at december  and consideration is given to the call dates of securities trading above par value and the expected prepayment patterns of mortgage backed securities 
actual cash flows could differ from the expected amounts  primarily due to future changes in interest rates

average interest rate mortgage backed securities average interest rate total at december  total thereafter amortized cost fair value in millions tax exempt average interest rate taxable other than mortgage backed securities 
average interest rate mortgage backed securities average interest rate total at december   our tax exempt fixed maturity portfolio had an average expected maturity of about five years 
our taxable fixed maturity portfolio had an average expected maturity of about four years 

table of contents credit risk credit risk is the potential loss resulting from adverse changes in an issuer s ability to repay its debt obligations 
we have consistently invested in high quality marketable securities 
at december   less than of our fixed maturity portfolio was below investment grade 
our investment portfolio did not have any direct exposure to either sub prime mortgages or collateralized debt obligations 
our decisions to acquire and hold specific tax exempt fixed maturities and taxable fixed maturities are primarily based on an initial and ongoing evaluation of the underlying characteristics  including credit quality  sector  structure and liquidity of the issuer  performed by our internal investment professionals 
third party credit ratings are also used by our investment professionals to help assess the relative credit quality of the issuer and manage the overall credit risk of our fixed maturity portfolio 
about of the third party credit ratings of our fixed maturity portfolio are obtained from moody s investors service 
our tax exempt fixed maturities comprise bonds issued by states  municipalities and political subdivisions within the united states 
our holdings consist of special revenue bonds issued by state and local government agencies  state  municipal and political subdivision general obligation bonds  and pre refunded bonds for which an irrevocable trust containing us government or government agency obligations has been established to fund the remaining payment of principal and interest 
our evaluation of a special revenue bond includes analyzing key credit factors such as the structure of the revenue pledge  the rate covenant  debt service reserve fund  margin of debt service coverage and the issuer s historic financial performance 
our evaluation of a general obligation bond issued by a state  municipality or political subdivision includes analyzing key credit factors such as the economic and financial condition of the issuer and its ability and commitment to service its debt 
at december   about of our tax exempt securities were rated aa or better with about rated aaa 
the average rating of our tax exempt securities was aa 
while about of our tax exempt securities were insured  the effect of insurance on the average credit rating of these securities was insignificant 
the insured tax exempt securities in our portfolio have been selected based on the quality of the underlying credit and not the value of the credit insurance enhancement 
at december   of our taxable fixed maturity portfolio was invested in us government and government agency and authority obligations other than mortgage backed securities and had an average rating of aa 
about of the us government and government agency and authority obligations other than mortgage backed securities were us treasury securities with an average rating of aaa and the remainder were taxable bonds issued by states  municipalities and political subdivisions within the united states with an average rating of aa 
at december   of our taxable fixed maturity portfolio consisted of corporate bonds other than mortgage backed securities  which were issued by a diverse group of us and foreign issuers and had an average rating of a 
about of our corporate bonds other than mortgage backed securities were issued by us companies and about were issued by foreign companies 
our foreign corporate bonds included million  million and million issued by companies  including banks  in italy  ireland and spain  respectively 
we held no bonds issued by companies in greece or portugal 
at december   of our taxable fixed maturity portfolio was invested in foreign government and government agency obligations  which had an average rating of aa 
the foreign government and government agency obligations consisted of high quality securities  primarily issued by national governments and  to a lesser extent  government agencies  regional governments and supranational organizations 
the five largest sovereign issuers within our portfolio were canada  germany  the united kingdom  australia and brazil  which collectively accounted for about of our total foreign government and government agency obligations 
another of our total foreign government and government agency obligations were issued by supranational organizations 
we held no sovereign securities issued by greece  portugal  ireland or italy and held only million of sovereign securities issued by spain 
we do not hold any foreign government or government agency fixed maturities that have third party guarantees 

table of contents at december   about of our taxable fixed maturity portfolio was invested in mortgage backed securities 
about of the mortgage backed securities were rated aaa 
about half of the remaining were below investment grade 
of the aaa rated securities  were residential mortgage backed securities  consisting of government agency pass through securities guaranteed by a government agency or a government sponsored enterprise gse  gse collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and other cmos  all backed by single family home mortgages 
the majority of our cmos are actively traded in liquid markets 
the other of the aaa rated securities were call protected  commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs 
about of our cmbs were senior securities with the highest level of subordination and the remainder were seasoned securities 
prepayment risk refers to the changes in prepayment patterns related to decreases and increases in interest rates that can either shorten or lengthen the expected timing of the principal repayments and thus the average life of a security  potentially reducing or increasing its effective yield 
such risk exists primarily within our portfolio of residential mortgage backed securities 
we monitor such risk regularly 
foreign currency risk foreign currency risk is the sensitivity to foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the fair value and investment income related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments 
the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the currency of the local operating environment since business is primarily transacted in such local currency 
we seek to mitigate the risks relating to currency fluctuations by generally maintaining investments in those foreign currencies in which our property and casualty subsidiaries have loss reserves and other liabilities  thereby limiting exchange rate risk to the net assets denominated in foreign currencies 
at december   the property and casualty subsidiaries held foreign currency denominated investments of billion supporting our international operations 
the principal currencies creating foreign exchange rate risk for the property and casualty subsidiaries were the canadian dollar  the british pound sterling  the euro and the australian dollar 
the following table provides information about those fixed maturity securities that are denominated in these currencies 
the table presents cash flows of principal amounts in us dollar equivalents by expected maturity dates at december  actual cash flows could differ from the expected amounts 
at december  total thereafter amortized cost fair value in millions canadian dollar british pound sterling euro australian dollar equity price risk equity price risk is the potential loss in fair value of our equity securities resulting from adverse changes in stock prices 
in general  equities have more year to year price variability than intermediate term high grade bonds 
however  returns over longer time frames have generally been higher 
our publicly traded equity securities are high quality  diversified across industries and readily marketable 
a hypothetical decrease of in the market price of each of the equity securities held at december  and would have resulted in a decrease of million and million  respectively  in the fair value of the equity securities portfolio 
all of the above risks are monitored on an ongoing basis 
a combination of in house systems and proprietary models and externally licensed software are used to analyze individual securities as well as each portfolio 
these tools provide the portfolio managers with information to assist them in the evaluation of the market risks of the portfolio
