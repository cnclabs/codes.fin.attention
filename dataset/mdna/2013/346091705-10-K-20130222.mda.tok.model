table of contents on june   forest completed the initial public offering of approximately of the common stock of its then wholly owned subsidiary  lone pine resources inc  which held forest s ownership interests in its canadian operations 
on september   forest distributed  or spun off  the remaining of lone pine by means of a special stock dividend to forest s shareholders 
lone pine s results are reported as discontinued operations throughout this annual report on form k 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued authoritative accounting guidance that addressed whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and  therefore  need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share under the two class method 
this guidance was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those years 
accordingly  forest adopted this guidance as of january  all prior period earnings per share data presented has been adjusted retrospectively to conform to the provisions of this guidance 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
all expectations  forecasts  assumptions  and beliefs about our future financial results  condition  operations  strategic plans  and performance are forward looking statements  as described in more detail in part i  item under the heading forward looking statements 
our actual results may differ materially because of a number of risks and uncertainties 
some of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in part i  item a risk factors  and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
historical statements made herein are accurate only as of the date of filing of this annual report on form k with the sec  and may be relied upon only as of that date 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with forest s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
forest is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition  exploration  development  and production of oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids primarily in north america 
forest was incorporated in new york in  as the successor to a company formed in  and has been a publicly held company since our total estimated proved reserves as of december  were approximately  bcfe  all of which are located in our one reportable geographical segment the united states 
our core operational areas are in the texas panhandle area  the eagle ford shale in south texas  and the east texas north louisiana area 
see item business for a discussion of our business strategy and core operational areas of focus 
on june   we completed an initial public offering of approximately of the common stock of our then wholly owned subsidiary  lone pine resources inc lone pine  which held our ownership interests in our canadian operations 
on september   we spun off our remaining shares of lone pine to our shareholders by means of a special stock dividend of lone pine common shares 
as a result of the spin off  lone pine s results of operations are reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods in which we held a controlling financial interest in lone pine 
highlights forest s highlights were as follows increased total oil and ngl sales volumes to of total equivalent sales volumes compared to in and in increased the percentage of oil reserves to of total estimated proved reserves as of december  from as of december   pro forma for the sales of oil and gas properties in received cash proceeds of million from the non core property divestiture program we initiated in in addition  on february   we received million from the sale of certain south texas properties as a continuing part of the divestiture program 
continued the development in the central fairway of our eagle ford shale acreage position in gonzales county  where we have experienced the most consistent results 
we drilled wells in the central fairway of the eagle ford shale during that had a day average gross production rate of boe d oil and of the wells had a day average gross production rate of boe d oil 

table of contents the most productive well completed during began producing in july and had cumulative production of approximately  barrels of oil in its first days 
drilled eight missourian wash hogshooter wells during that had a day average gross production rate of  boe d oil and a day average gross production rate of  boe d oil 
the most productive well completed during began producing in january and had cumulative equivalent production of approximately  barrels of oil in its first year of sales

results of operations forest recorded a net loss in of billion as compared to net earnings from continuing operations of million in the net loss in was primarily due to ceiling test write downs and other non cash property impairments during totaling billion as well as a million valuation allowance placed against prior year s net deferred tax assets primarily as a result of the ceiling test write downs and property impairments recognized in see critical accounting policies  estimates  judgments and assumptions valuation of deferred tax assets for further discussion of our valuation allowance 
adjusted ebidta  which is a non generally accepted accounting principles gaap performance measure commonly used by management  securities analysts  and investors that excludes non cash items such as depletion expense  deferred income tax expense  ceiling test write downs  and impairments  was million in as compared to million in the decrease of million was primarily attributable to changes in oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids ngls production and prices as well as changes in realized commodity derivative gains between the two periods 
see reconciliation of non gaap measure at the end of this item for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids volumes and revenues oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids sales volumes  revenues  and average sales prices from continuing operations for the years ended december    and  are set forth in the table below 
year ended december  sales volumes oil mbbls natural gas mmcf ngls mbbls totals mmcfe revenues in thousands oil natural gas ngls totals average sales price per unit oil bbl natural gas mcf ngls bbl totals mcfe 
table of contents equivalent sales volumes from continuing operations decreased in as compared to  with the decrease in natural gas volumes being nearly offset by a increase in oil volumes and an increase in ngl volumes 
this change in the relative weighting of production by product was the result of our continued focus on the development of liquids rich prospects in total oil and ngl sales volumes increased to of total equivalent sales volumes compared to in and in revenues from oil  natural gas  and ngls were million in as compared to million in the million decrease was primarily the result of the decline in the market price for natural gas and ngls  partially offset by the increase in oil sales volumes of mbbls  which increased oil revenues in by million compared to the previous year based on the average sales price realization of per barrel in our equivalent sales volumes from continuing operations decreased in compared to  primarily due to a decrease in natural gas production 
total oil  natural gas  and ngl revenues were essentially flat between and  primarily with increases in oil and ngl prices being offset by a decrease in natural gas production as well as prices 
the revenues and average sales prices reflected in the table above exclude the effects of commodity derivative instruments because we have elected not to designate our derivative instruments as cash flow hedges 
the table below shows the average realized price per unit from continuing operations including the effects of commodity derivative instruments we had in place for the periods presented

table of contents production expense the table below sets forth the detail of production expense from continuing operations for the periods indicated 
year ended december  in thousands  except per mcfe data production expense lease operating expenses production and property taxes transportation and processing costs production expense production expense per mcfe lease operating expenses production and property taxes transportation and processing costs production expense per mcfe lease operating expenses lease operating expenses in were million  or 
per mcfe  compared to million  or 
per mcfe  in the 
per mcfe increase in compared to was primarily due to increases in water disposal costs and workovers as well as an increase in oil production 
based on the energy equivalent ratio of six mcf of natural gas to one barrel of oil  oil production typically has higher per unit lease operating costs than does natural gas production 
however  because the market price of oil relative to natural gas is currently well in excess of the six to one ratio  the increase in lease operating expense associated with an increase in oil production is more than offset by the additional revenues realized from oil sales 
lease operating expenses were million  or 
per mcfe  in compared to million  or 
per mcfe  in the increase in total and per unit lease operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in water disposal costs 
production and property taxes production and property taxes  consisting primarily of severance taxes paid on the value of the oil  natural gas  and ngls sold  were   and of oil  natural gas  and ngl sales for the years ended december    and  respectively 
normal fluctuations occur in this percentage between periods based upon the timing of approval of incentive tax credits in texas  changes in tax rates  and changes in the assessed values of oil and gas properties and equipment for purposes of ad valorem taxes 
transportation and processing costs transportation and processing costs were million  or

table of contents general and administrative expense the following table summarizes the components of general and administrative expense from continuing operations for the periods indicated 
year ended december  in thousands  except per mcfe data stock based compensation costs stock based compensation costs capitalized other general and administrative costs other general and administrative costs capitalized general and administrative expense general and administrative expense per mcfe general and administrative expense was million in compared to million in both and the primary reason for the decrease was due to a decrease in stock based compensation costs in compared to stock based compensation costs decreased primarily due to the decrease in our stock price 
additionally  million in stock based compensation costs million of expense  net of capitalized amounts were recognized in related to the spin off of lone pine  which caused the forfeiture restrictions to lapse on a portion of each outstanding restricted stock award  thus requiring the immediate recognition of compensation cost 
this decrease in stock based compensation costs was partially offset by million in accelerated stock based compensation costs million of expense  net of capitalized amounts related to the termination of our former chief executive officer  which was recognized during the second quarter of the percentage of general and administrative costs capitalized remained consistent between the three years presented  ranging between and 
depreciation  depletion  and amortization the following table summarizes depreciation  depletion  and amortization expense from continuing operations for the periods indicated 
year ended december  in thousands  except per mcfe data depreciation  depletion  and amortization expense depreciation  depletion  and amortization expense per mcfe depreciation  depletion  and amortization expense dd a increased 
per mcfe to per mcfe in compared to per mcfe in the increase in dd a from to is due primarily to the increase in oil reserve additions since  which typically have higher per unit development costs than natural gas reserves 
in addition  in  a significant portion of our proved undeveloped natural gas reserves  which have lower associated development costs than do proved undeveloped oil reserves  were reclassified from proved to probable status in conjunction with the decrease in the natural gas prices used to determine our proved reserves 
this reclassification also contributed to the increase in our dd a rate 

table of contents ceiling test write down of oil and natural gas properties in  we recorded ceiling test write downs of our united states cost center totaling million  pursuant to the ceiling test limitation prescribed by the sec for companies using the full cost method of accounting 
these ceiling test write downs were primarily a result of the decline in the twelve month arithmetic average prices of natural gas and ngls that were used to calculate the present value of future net revenues from our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves throughout additional write downs of our oil and natural gas properties may be required in subsequent periods if  among other things  the unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month oil  natural gas  or ngl prices used in the calculation of the present value of future net revenues from estimated production of proved oil and natural gas reserves declines compared to prices used as of december   unproved property values decrease  estimated proved reserve volumes are revised downward  or costs incurred in exploration  development  or acquisition activities exceed the discounted future net cash flows from the additional reserves  if any  attributable to the cost center 
see critical accounting policies  estimates  judgments and assumptions full cost method of accounting for more information regarding ceiling test write downs 
in april  an italian regional regulatory body denied approval of an environmental impact assessment associated with our proposal to commence natural gas production from wells that we drilled and completed in we are currently appealing the region s denial  however  until the region s denial is reversed or overturned  we determined that we could no longer conclude with reasonable certainty that our italian natural gas reserves are producible 
accordingly  we reclassified the italian reserves from proved to probable effective in the first quarter of and recorded a ceiling test write down of our italian cost center of million 
impairment of properties during the third quarter of  we recorded a million impairment of our unproved properties in south africa based on several unsuccessful attempts to sell the properties for an amount that would allow us to recover the carrying amount of our investment in these properties 
because we have no proved reserves in south africa  the impairment was reported as a period expense rather than being added to the costs to be amortized and is included in the consolidated statement of operations within the impairment of properties line item 
in december  we entered into agreements to sell our south african subsidiaries and abandon a certain exploration right in south africa 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding this planned divestiture 
in august  we entered into an agreement to sell the majority of our east texas natural gas gathering assets for million in cash and the transaction closed in october during the third quarter of  these assets were written down to their estimated fair value less cost to sell  with a million impairment charge included in the consolidated statement of operations within the impairment of properties line item 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding this divestiture 
interest expense the following table summarizes interest expense from continuing operations for the periods indicated 
year ended december  in thousands interest costs interest costs capitalized interest expense interest expense in totaled million compared to million in the million decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to the redemption of million of senior notes in december and the redemption of million of senior notes in october  partially offset by an increase in interest 
table of contents costs incurred on borrowings under our bank credit facility in  interest costs on the senior notes issued in september  and lower capitalized interest in interest costs capitalized relate to our investments in significant unproved acreage positions that are under development 
interest expense totaled million in both and in order to reduce our concentration of fixed rate debt  we have entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps under which we have swapped  as of december   million in notional amount at an fixed rate for an equal notional amount at a weighted average interest rate equal to the month libor plus approximately 
we recognized realized gains under these interest rate swaps of million during each of the years ended december    and these gains are recorded as realized gains on derivatives rather than as a reduction to interest expense since we have not elected to use hedge accounting 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our interest rate derivatives

the significant difference between our blended federal and state statutory income tax rate of and our effective income tax rate of in was primarily due to a million valuation allowance placed against our deferred tax assets in without this valuation allowance  our effective income tax rate would have been in the current income tax credit provision in of million primarily relates to income tax refunds filed during associated with tax loss carrybacks to recover income taxes paid in our effective income tax rate was in due to the canadian dividend tax of million that was incurred on a stock dividend declared and paid by our former canadian subsidiary  lone pine resources canada ltd

table of contents discontinued operations the results of operations of lone pine are presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for and due to the spin off of lone pine on september  see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the components of earnings from discontinued operations 
liquidity and capital resources our exploration  development  and acquisition activities require us to make significant operating and capital expenditures 
historically  we have used cash flow from operations and our bank credit facility as our primary sources of liquidity 
to fund large transactions  such as acquisitions and debt refinancing transactions  we have looked to the private and public capital markets as another source of financing and  as market conditions have permitted  we have engaged in asset monetization transactions 
changes in the market prices for oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids directly impact our level of cash flow generated from operations 
natural gas accounted for approximately of our total production in and  as a result  our operations and cash flow are more sensitive to fluctuations in the market price for natural gas than to fluctuations in the market prices for oil and natural gas liquids 
we employ a commodity hedging strategy as an attempt to moderate the effects of wide fluctuations in commodity prices on our cash flow 
as of february   we had hedged  via commodity swaps  approximately bcfe of our total projected production and approximately bcf of our total projected production  excluding outstanding commodity swaptions 
this level of hedging will provide a measure of certainty with respect to the cash flow that we will receive for a portion of our future production 
however  these hedging activities may result in reduced income or even financial losses to us 
see part i  item a risk factors our use of hedging transactions could reduce our cash flow and or result in reported losses  for further details of the risks associated with our hedging activities 
in the future  we may determine to increase or decrease our hedging positions 
as of february   all but one of our derivative instrument counterparties are lenders  or affiliates of lenders  under our credit facility 
see part ii  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk  below for more information on our derivative contracts 
as noted above  the other primary source of liquidity is our credit facility  which had a borrowing base of billion as of december  in connection with the closing of our south texas divestiture  the borrowing base was reduced to million effective february  this facility is used to fund daily operations and to fund acquisitions and refinance debt  as needed and if available 
the credit facility is secured by a portion of our assets  with the facility maturing in june see bank credit facility below for further details 
we had million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility as of december  and had no borrowings outstanding at february  as noted below under bank credit facility  our credit facility contains a covenant that we will not permit our ratio of total debt outstanding to ebitda as adjusted for non cash charges for a trailing twelve month period to be greater than to at any time 
depending on our overall level of indebtedness  this covenant may limit our ability to borrow funds as needed under our credit facility 
see part i  item a risk factors our debt agreements contain restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or pursue business opportunities  for the risks associated with the restrictive covenants in our debt agreements  including the credit agreement 
the public and private capital markets have served as our primary source of financing to fund large acquisitions and other exceptional transactions  such as debt refinancings 
in the past  we have issued debt and equity in both the public and private capital markets 
for example  we completed a private offering of million of senior notes due in september  using some of the proceeds to redeem million of our senior notes due our ability to access the debt and equity capital markets on economic terms is affected by general economic conditions  the domestic and global financial markets  the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies  our operational and financial performance  the value and performance of our equity and debt securities  prevailing commodity prices  and other macroeconomic factors outside of our control 

table of contents see note and note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our debt and equity  respectively 
we also have engaged in asset dispositions as a means of generating additional cash to fund expenditures and enhance our financial flexibility 
for example  during   and  we sold various non core assets for approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
in february  we sold all of our oil and natural gas properties located in south texas  excluding our eagle ford shale oil properties  for net proceeds of million  which we plan to use in march to redeem the remaining million of our outstanding senior notes due we believe that our cash flows provided by operating activities and the funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our normal recurring operating needs  anticipated capital expenditures  and our contractual obligations 
however  if our revenue and cash flow decrease in the future as a result of a deterioration in domestic and global economic conditions  a significant decline in commodity prices  or a continuation of depressed natural gas prices  we may elect to reduce our planned capital expenditures  as we did in the second half of we believe that this financial flexibility to adjust our spending levels will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our financial obligations 
see part i  item a risk factors  for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties that affect our business and financial and operating results 
bank credit facility on june   we entered into the third amended and restated credit agreement the credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by jpmorgan chase bank  na the administrative agent consisting of a billion credit facility maturing in june the size of the credit facility may be increased by million  to a total of billion  upon agreement between us and the applicable lenders 
our availability under the credit facility is governed by a borrowing base 
as of december   the borrowing base under the credit facility was billion 
the determination of the borrowing base is made by the lenders in their sole discretion  on a semi annual basis  taking into consideration the estimated value of our oil and gas properties based on pricing models determined by the lenders at such time  in accordance with the lenders customary practices for oil and gas loans 
the available borrowing amount under the credit facility could increase or decrease based on such redetermination 
a lowering of the borrowing base could require us to repay indebtedness in excess of the borrowing base in order to cover the deficiency 
the last scheduled semi annual redetermination of the borrowing base occurred in october and resulted in a million reduction to the borrowing base 
the next scheduled semi annual redetermination of the borrowing base will occur on or about may  in addition to the scheduled semi annual redeterminations  we and the lenders each have discretion at any time  but not more often than once during a calendar year  to have the borrowing base redetermined 
the borrowing base is also subject to automatic adjustments if certain events occur  such as if we or any of our restricted subsidiaries as defined in the credit facility issue senior unsecured notes  in which case the borrowing base will immediately be reduced by an amount equal to of the stated principal amount of such issued senior notes  excluding any senior unsecured notes that we or any of our restricted subsidiaries may issue to refinance senior notes that were outstanding on june  this was the case in september  when the borrowing base was reduced by million 
the borrowing base is also subject to automatic adjustment if we or any of our restricted subsidiaries sell oil and natural gas properties included in the borrowing base  as applicable  having a fair market value in excess of of the borrowing base then in effect 
in this case  the borrowing base will be reduced by an amount either i equal to the percentage of the borrowing base attributable to the sold properties  as determined by the administrative agent  or ii if none of the borrowing base is attributable to the sold properties  a value agreed upon by us and the required lenders 
the sale of our south louisiana properties resulted in an million reduction to the borrowing base when the transaction closed in november and the sale of our south texas properties resulted in a million reduction to the borrowing base when the transaction closed in february  bringing the borrowing base to million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding these divestitures 

table of contents the credit facility is collateralized by our assets 
under the credit facility  we are required to mortgage and grant a security interest in of the present value of the estimated proved oil and gas properties and related assets 
if our corporate credit ratings issued by moody s and s p meet pre established levels  the security requirements would cease to apply and  at our request  the banks would release their liens and security interest on our properties 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at one of two rates as may be elected by us 
borrowings bear interest at i the greatest of a the prime rate announced by jpmorgan chase bank  na  b the federal funds effective rate from time to time plus of  and c the one month rate applicable to dollar deposits in the london interbank market for one  two  three or six months as selected by us the libo rate plus  plus  in the case of each of clauses a  b  and c  to basis points depending on borrowing base utilization  or ii the libo rate as adjusted for statutory reserve requirements the adjusted libo rate  plus to basis points  depending on borrowing base utilization 
the credit facility includes terms and covenants that place limitations on certain types of activities  including restrictions or requirements with respect to additional debt  liens  asset sales  hedging activities  investments  dividends  mergers  and acquisitions  and also includes a financial covenant 
the credit facility provides that we will not permit our ratio of total debt outstanding to ebitda as adjusted for non cash charges for a trailing twelve month period to be greater than to at any time 
our ratio of total debt outstanding to ebitda for the twelve month period ended december   as calculated in accordance with the credit facility  was we expect to continue to meet this covenant by maintaining our capital expenditures at levels that approximate our cash flows from operating activities in subsequent quarters and by using proceeds from the sale of non core assets such as our south texas properties to reduce debt 
under certain conditions  amounts outstanding under the credit facility may be accelerated 
bankruptcy and insolvency events with respect to us or certain of our subsidiaries will result in an automatic acceleration of the indebtedness under the credit facility 
subject to notice and cure periods  certain events of default under the credit facility will result in acceleration of the indebtedness under the credit facility at the option of the lenders 
such other events of default include non payment  breach of warranty  non performance of obligations under the credit facility including the financial covenant  default on other indebtedness  certain pension plan events  certain adverse judgments  change of control  and a failure of the liens securing the credit facility 
of the billion total nominal amount under the credit facility  jpmorgan and ten other banks hold approximately of the total commitments 
with respect to the other of the total commitments  no single lender holds more than of the total commitments 
commitment fees accrue on the amount of unutilized borrowing base 
if borrowing base utilization is greater than  commitment fees are basis points of the unutilized amount  and if borrowing base utilization is or less  commitment fees are basis points of the unutilized amount 
at december   there were outstanding borrowings of million under the credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of and we had used the credit facility for million in letters of credit  leaving an unused borrowing amount under the credit facility of billion 
at february   there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and we had used the credit facility for million in letters of credit  leaving an unused borrowing amount under the credit facility of million 
credit ratings our credit risk is evaluated by two independent rating agencies based on publicly available information and information obtained during our ongoing discussions with the rating agencies 
moody s investors service and standard poor s ratings services currently rate each series of our senior notes and  in addition  they have 
table of contents assigned forest a general credit rating 
our credit facility includes provisions that are linked to our credit ratings 
for example  our collateral requirements will vary based on our credit ratings  however  we do not have any credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of amounts due under the credit facility or the debt issued under the indentures for our senior notes 
the indentures for our senior notes also include terms linked to our credit ratings 
these terms allow us greater flexibility if our credit ratings improve to investment grade and other tests have been satisfied  in which event we would not be obligated to comply with certain restrictive covenants included in the indentures 
our ability to raise funds and the costs of any financing activities will be affected by our credit ratings at the time any such financing activities are conducted

total capital expenditures also include changes in estimated discounted asset retirement obligations of million  million  and million recorded during the years ended december    and  respectively 
we have established an exploration and development capital budget of million to million for  which we anticipate will approximate our cash flow based on expected commodity prices and continues our focus on higher margin oil opportunities 
primary factors impacting the level of our capital expenditures include oil and natural gas prices  the volatility in these prices  the cost and availability of oil field services  general economic and market conditions  and weather disruptions 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  after total in thousands bank debt senior notes derivative liabilities other liabilities operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual obligations bank debt consists of the million outstanding balance under our credit facility as of december   as well as the anticipated interest payments on that balance and commitment and letter of credit fees  all based on the actual rates in effect as of december  and the billion borrowing base and million in outstanding letters of credit as of december   assuming all such balances remain outstanding until the maturity of the credit facility 
senior notes consist of the principal obligations on our senior notes and senior subordinated notes and anticipated interest payments due on each  assuming all notes remain outstanding in full until their respective maturities 
derivative liabilities represent the fair value of our derivative liabilities as of december  the ultimate settlement amounts of our derivative liabilities are unknown  because they are subject to continuing market risk 
see critical accounting policies  estimates  judgments  and assumptions below for a more detailed discussion of the nature of the accounting estimates involved in valuing derivative instruments 
other liabilities are comprised of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and asset retirement obligations  for which neither the ultimate settlement amounts nor the timing of settlement can be precisely determined in advance 
see critical accounting policies  estimates  judgments  and assumptions below for a more detailed discussion of the nature of the accounting estimates involved in estimating asset retirement obligations 
operating leases consist of leases for drilling rigs  compressors  and office facilities and equipment 
unconditional purchase obligations consist primarily of drilling commitments  throughput obligations  and voice and data services 
we also make delay rental payments to lessors during the primary terms of oil and gas leases to delay drilling or production of wells  usually for one year 
although we are not obligated to make such payments  discontinuing them would result in the loss of the oil and gas lease 
our estimated maximum commitment of future delay lease rental payments  through  totaled approximately million as of december  off balance sheet arrangements from time to time  we enter into off balance sheet arrangements and other transactions that can give rise to off balance sheet obligations 
as of december   the off balance sheet arrangements and other transactions that we have entered into include i undrawn letters of credit  ii operating lease agreements  iii drilling commitments  and iv other contractual obligations for which we have recorded estimated liabilities on the balance sheet  but the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed and determinable  such as derivative contracts  pension and other postretirement benefit obligations  and asset retirement obligations 
we do not believe that any of these arrangements are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or availability of  or requirements for  capital resources 
surety bonds in the ordinary course of our business and operations  we are required to post surety bonds from time to time with third parties  including governmental agencies 
in addition  while we appeal the arbitration award in forest oil corporation  et al

el rucio land cattle company  inc  et al 
see item legal proceedings  we are required to post a supercedeas bond 
as of february   we had obtained this supercedeas bond as well as surety bonds from a number of insurance and bonding institutions covering certain of our current and former

see part i  item business industry regulation for further information 
critical accounting policies  estimates  judgments  and assumptions full cost method of accounting the accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and gas business activities the full cost method and the successful efforts method 
the differences between the two methods can lead to significant variances in the amounts reported in financial statements 
we have elected to follow the full cost method  which is described below 
under the full cost method  separate cost centers are maintained for each country in which we incur costs 
all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration  and development of properties including costs of surrendered and abandoned leaseholds  delay lease rentals  dry holes  and overhead related to exploration and development activities are capitalized 
the fair value of estimated future costs of site restoration  dismantlement  and abandonment activities is capitalized  and a corresponding asset retirement obligation liability is recorded 
capitalized costs applicable to each full cost center are depleted using the units of production method based on conversion to common units of measure using one barrel of oil as an equivalent to six thousand cubic feet of natural gas 
changes in estimates of reserves or future development costs are accounted for in the current quarter and prospectively in the depletion calculations 
we have historically updated our quarterly depletion calculations with our quarter end reserves estimates 
based on this accounting policy  our december  reserves estimates were used for our fourth quarter depletion calculation 
see part i  item  business reserves and note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of our estimated proved reserves as of december  companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter for each cost center 
the full cost ceiling test is a limitation on capitalized costs prescribed by sec regulation s x rule the ceiling test is not a fair value based measurement 
rather  it is a standardized mathematical calculation 
the test determines a limit  or ceiling  on the book value of oil and gas properties 
that limit is basically the after tax present value of the future net cash flows from estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves calculated using current prices  which are the unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month oil  natural gas  and ngl prices 
this ceiling is compared to the net book value of the oil and gas properties reduced by any related net deferred income tax liability 
if the net book value reduced by the related deferred income taxes exceeds the ceiling  a non cash write down is required 
in  forest recorded ceiling test write downs in the united states cost center totaling million and in the italian cost center totaling million 
the united states ceiling test write downs were primarily a result of the decline in the twelve month arithmetic average prices of natural gas and ngls 
in areas where the existence of proved reserves has not yet been determined  leasehold costs  seismic costs  and other costs incurred during the exploration phase remain capitalized as unproved property costs until proved reserves have been established or until exploration activities cease 
investments in unproved properties are not depleted pending the determination of the existence of proved reserves 
if exploration activities result in the establishment of proved reserves  amounts are reclassified as proved properties and become subject to depreciation  depletion  and amortization  and the application of the ceiling limitation 
unproved properties are assessed periodically to ascertain whether impairment has occurred 
unproved properties whose costs are individually significant are assessed individually by considering the primary lease terms of the properties  the holding period of the properties  geographic and geologic data obtained relating to the properties  and estimated discounted future net cash flows from the properties 
where it is not practicable to individually assess properties whose costs are not individually significant  such properties are grouped for purposes of assessing impairment 
the amount of impairment assessed is added to the costs to be amortized in the appropriate full cost pool  or reported as impairment expense in the consolidated statements of operations  as applicable 
during the year ended december   we recorded a million impairment of our unproved properties in south africa based on several unsuccessful 
table of contents attempts to sell the properties for an amount that would allow us to recover the carrying amount of our investment in these properties 
because we have no proved reserves in south africa  and therefore no costs being amortized  the impairment was reported as a period expense and is included in the consolidated statement of operations within the impairment of properties line item 
under the alternative successful efforts method of accounting  surrendered  abandoned  and impaired leases  delay lease rentals  exploratory dry holes  and overhead costs are expensed as incurred 
capitalized costs are depleted on a property by property basis 
impairments are also assessed on a property by property basis and are charged to expense when assessed 
the full cost method is used to account for our oil and gas exploration and development activities because we believe it appropriately reports the costs of our exploration programs as part of an overall investment in discovering and developing proved reserves 
goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the second quarter of the year 
in addition  we test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
in the first step of testing for goodwill impairment  we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit  which we have determined to be our us geographic operating segment  and compare the fair value with the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit 
if the fair value is greater than the carrying value  then no impairment results 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  then we perform a second step and determine the fair value of the goodwill 
in this second step  the fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price was being initially allocated 
if the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value for a reporting unit  an impairment charge would be recorded to earnings in the consolidated statement of operations 
to determine the fair value of our reporting unit  we calculate the market capitalization of our reporting unit based on our quoted stock price 
quoted prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value 
because value results from the ability to take advantage of synergies and other benefits that exist from a collection of assets and liabilities that operate together in a controlled entity  the market capitalization of a reporting unit with publicly traded equity securities may not be representative of the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole 
therefore  we add a control premium to the market capitalization 
additionally  we subtract an estimated amount that market participants would attribute to our stock price for the value of our international operations  to which no goodwill has been allocated 
the sum of our market capitalization and control premium  less the international value  is the fair value of our reporting unit 
this amount is then compared to the carrying value of our reporting unit 
in performing step two of the goodwill impairment test  one of the more significant estimates is determining the fair value of our oil and gas properties 
to determine the fair value of our oil and gas properties  we use a discounted cash flow model to value our total estimated reserves  which include proved  probable  and possible reserves 
this approach relies on significant judgments about the quantity of reserves  the timing of the expected production  the pricing that will be in effect at the time of production  and the appropriate discount rates to be used 
our discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of forest s weighted average cost of capital 
at the time of our annual goodwill impairment test  the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
the market capitalization alone  without adjustments for the control premium and international value  also exceeded the carrying value 
subsequent to the completion of our annual test  we performed an interim quarterly test due to the loss of key personnel in the second quarter 
we did not record a goodwill impairment charge during the year ended december  however  due to the significant judgments that go into the goodwill impairment test  as discussed above  there can be no assurance that our goodwill will not be impaired at any time in the future 

table of contents oil and gas reserves estimates our estimates of proved reserves are based on the quantities of oil and gas  which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire  unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain 
the accuracy of any reserves estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation  and judgment 
for example  we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs  production and property taxes  development costs  and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
in addition  as oil  natural gas  and ngl prices that we are required to use pursuant to sec regulations change from period to period  the estimate of proved reserves will also change and the change can be significant 
despite the inherent uncertainty in these engineering estimates  our reserves are used throughout our financial statements 
for example  since we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties  the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our dd a expense 
our oil and gas properties are also subject to a ceiling test limitation based in part on the quantity of our proved reserves 
finally  these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
reference should be made to reserves under part i  item business  and our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves involve inherent uncertainty  which could materially affect the quantity and value of our reported reserves and our financial condition  under part i  item a risk factors  in this annual report on form k 
fair value of derivative instruments we use the income approach in determining the fair value of our derivative instruments  utilizing present value techniques for valuing our swaps and option pricing models for valuing our collars  swaptions  and puts 
inputs to these valuation techniques include published forward prices  volatilities  and credit risk considerations  including the incorporation of published interest rates and credit spreads 
the values we report in our financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect changes in market conditions or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the accounting treatment for the changes in fair value of a derivative instrument is dependent upon whether or not a derivative instrument is a cash flow hedge or a fair value hedge  and upon whether or not the derivative is designated as a hedge 
changes in fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge are recognized  to the extent the hedge is effective  in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge  to the extent the hedge is effective  have no effect on the statement of operations  because changes in fair value of the derivative offset changes in the fair value of the hedged item 
where hedge accounting is not elected  or if a derivative instrument does not qualify as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings as other income or expense 
we have elected not to use hedge accounting to account for our derivative instruments and  as a result  all changes in the fair values of our derivative instruments are recognized in earnings as unrealized gains or losses in the line item realized and unrealized gains on derivative instruments  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
due to the volatility of oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids prices and interest rates  the estimated fair values of our derivative instruments are subject to large fluctuations from period to period 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a sensitivity analysis of the change in net fair values of our commodity and interest rate derivatives based on a hypothetical change in commodity prices and interest rates 

table of contents valuation of deferred tax assets we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases temporary differences 
income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are likely to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on income tax assets and liabilities is included in earnings in the period in which the change is enacted 
the book value of income tax assets is limited to the amount of the tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized in the future 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
in making this assessment  we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  available taxes in carryback periods  tax planning strategies  and projected future taxable income 
if the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future book income  assessing the need for  or the sufficiency of  a valuation allowance requires the evaluation of all available evidence  both negative and positive  as to whether it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized 
negative evidence considered by us included a three year cumulative book loss driven primarily by the ceiling test write downs incurred in positive evidence considered by us included forecasted book income in future years based on expected future oil  natural gas  and ngl production and expected commodity prices based on nymex oil and natural gas futures 
based upon the evaluation of what we determined to be relevant evidence  we have recorded a valuation allowance of million against our deferred tax assets as of december  although we expect future book income based on future production and future nymex oil and natural gas prices  oil and natural gas prices have been highly volatile over recent years  and only a portion of our forecasted production is hedged through the end of asset retirement obligations forest has obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore locations at the end of the oil and gas production operations 
estimating the future restoration and removal costs  or asset retirement obligations aro  requires us to make estimates and judgments  because most of the obligations are many years in the future  and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal 
asset removal technologies and costs periodically change  as do regulatory  political  environmental  safety  and public relations considerations 
inherent in the calculation of the present value of our aro are numerous assumptions and judgments  including the ultimate settlement amounts  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement  and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental  and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing aro liability  a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance 
increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time are reflected as accretion expense  which is included in other  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no

in january  the fasb issued asu  balance sheet topic clarifying the scope of disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities  which limits the scope of asu no 
to derivatives  including bifurcated embedded derivatives  repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements  and securities borrowing and lending transactions 
asu was issued in order to facilitate comparison of financial statements prepared under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and international financial reporting standards by requiring enhanced disclosures  but does not change existing us gaap  which permits

this authoritative guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods 
the adoption of this authoritative guidance will not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations  but will require us to make additional disclosures regarding our derivative instruments 
in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income asu 
asu does not change the current requirements for reporting net earnings or other comprehensive income in financial statements 
however  it requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
in addition  an entity is required to present significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net earnings  but only if the amount reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified to net earnings in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for other amounts that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net earnings  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures required under us gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts 
this authoritative guidance is effective prospectively for annual reporting periods beginning after december   and interim periods within those annual periods 
the adoption of this authoritative guidance will not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we are currently evaluating the impact adoption of this authoritative guidance may have on our disclosures 
reconciliation of non gaap measure adjusted ebitda in addition to reporting net earnings loss from continuing operations as defined under gaap  we also present adjusted earnings from continuing operations before interest  income taxes  depreciation  depletion  and amortization adjusted ebitda  which is a non gaap performance measure 
adjusted ebitda consists of net earnings from continuing operations before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation  depletion  and amortization  as well as other non cash operating items such as unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments and accretion of asset retirement obligations and other items presented in the table below 
adjusted ebitda does not represent  and should not be considered an alternative to  gaap measurements  such as net earnings loss from continuing operations its most comparable gaap financial measure  and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
by eliminating interest  taxes  depreciation  depletion  amortization  and other items from earnings  we believe the result is a useful measure across time in evaluating our fundamental core operating performance 
management also uses adjusted ebitda to manage our business  including in preparing our annual operating budget and financial projections 
we believe that adjusted ebitda is also useful to investors because similar measures are frequently used by securities analysts  investors  and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies in similar industries 
our management does not view adjusted ebitda in isolation and also uses other measurements  such as net earnings loss from continuing operations and revenues  to measure operating performance 
the following table provides a reconciliation of net earnings loss from continuing operations  the most directly comparable gaap measure  to adjusted ebitda for the periods presented

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including the effects of adverse changes in commodity prices  interest rates  and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 
commodity price risk we produce and sell natural gas  oil  and ngls in the united states 
as a result  our financial results are affected when prices for these commodities fluctuate 
such effects can be significant 
in order to reduce the impact of fluctuations in commodity prices  or to protect the economics of property acquisitions  we make use of a commodity hedging strategy 
under our hedging strategy  we enter into commodity swaps  collars  and other derivative instruments with counterparties who  in general  are lenders  or affiliates of such lenders  in our credit facility 
these arrangements  which are typically based on prices available in the financial markets at the time the contracts are entered into  are settled in cash and do not require physical deliveries of hydrocarbons 
swaps in a typical commodity swap agreement  we receive the difference between a fixed price per unit of production and a price based on an agreed upon published  third party index if the index price is lower than the fixed price 
if the index price is higher  we pay the difference 
by entering into swap agreements  we effectively fix the price that we will receive in the future for the hedged production 
our current swaps are settled in cash on a monthly basis

due to the volatility of oil  natural gas  and ngl prices  the estimated fair values of our commodity derivative instruments are subject to large fluctuations from period to period 
for example  a hypothetical increase in the forward oil  natural gas  and ngl prices used to calculate the fair values of our commodity derivative instruments at december  would decrease the net fair value of our commodity derivative instruments at december  by approximately million to a net liability of million 
it has been our experience that commodity prices are subject to large fluctuations  and we expect this volatility to continue 
actual gains or losses recognized related to our commodity derivative instruments will likely differ from those estimated at december  and will depend exclusively on the price of the commodities on the specified settlement dates provided by the derivative contracts

foreign currency exchange rate risk we conduct business in italy and south africa  and thus are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk on cash flows related primarily to expenses and investing transactions 
we have not entered into any foreign currency forward contracts or other similar financial instruments to manage this risk 
expenditures incurred relative to the foreign concessions held by us outside of north america have been primarily united states dollar denominated
