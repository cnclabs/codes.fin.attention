see forward looking statements for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
introduction this management discussion and analysis of financial condition is intended to provide investors with an understanding of the historical performance of our business  its financial condition and its prospects 
we will discuss and provide our analysis of the following overview of business  business segments  results of operations and related information  liquidity and capital resources  adoption of new accounting pronouncements  and critical accounting policies and use of estimates 
overview of business we are a leading producer of technical products and premium fine papers 
we have two primary operations our technical products business and our fine paper business 
our mission is to create value by improving the image and performance of everything we touch 
we expect to create value by expanding our presence in growing technical products markets  while delivering attractive returns from our fine paper business 
in managing our businesses  we believe that achieving and maintaining a leadership position in our markets  responding effectively to customer needs and competitive challenges  employing capital optimally  controlling costs and managing risks are important to long term success 
changes in input costs and general economic conditions also impact our results 
in this discussion and analysis  we will refer to these factors 
competitive environment our past results have been and our future prospects will be significantly affected by the competitive environment in which we operate 
in most of our markets  our businesses compete directly with well known competitors  some of which are larger and more diversified 
while our businesses are oriented to premium performance and quality they may also face competitive pressures from lower value products 
economic conditions and input costs the markets for all of our products are affected to a significant degree by economic conditions  including rapid changes in input costs  particularly for pulp  latex and natural gas 
our results are also affected by fluctuations in exchange rates  particularly for the euro 

table of contents business segments our technical products business is a leading international producer of transportation and other filter media and durable  saturated and coated substrates for a variety of end markets 
we focus on categories where we believe we are  or can be  a market leader  which include  among others  the transportation and other filtration media  tape  abrasive  nonwoven wall coverings  label  medical packaging and image transfer technical products markets 
our technical products manufacturing facilities are located near munich and frankfurt  germany and in munising  michigan 
we believe our fine paper business is the leading supplier of premium writing  text and cover papers  bright papers and specialty papers in north america 
our products include some of the most recognized and preferred papers in north america  where we enjoy leading market positions in many of our product categories 
we sell our products primarily to authorized paper distributors  converters  major national retailers and specialty businesses 
we believe that our fine paper manufacturing facilities located in appleton  neenah and whiting  wisconsin are among the most efficient for their markets and make us one of the lowest cost producers in the product categories in which we compete 
the other segment includes the index  tag and vellum bristol brands acquired from wausau 
results of operations and related information in this section  we discuss and analyze our net sales  income before interest and income taxes which we refer to as operating income in this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other information relevant to an understanding of our results of operations 
executive summary on january   we purchased certain premium paper brands and other assets from wausau 
we paid approximately million for i the premium fine paper brands astrobrights  astroparche and royal  ii exclusive  royalty free and perpetual license rights for a portion of the exact brand specialty business  including index  tag and vellum bristol  iii approximately one month of finished goods inventory and iv certain converting equipment used for retail grades 
for the year ended december   consolidated net sales increased million from the prior year to million primarily due to incremental volume from the brands acquired from wausau 
consolidated operating income of million for the year ended december  increased million from the prior year 
excluding acquisition related integration costs of approximately million  a serp settlement charge of million and costs of million related to the early redemption of senior notes in and costs of related to the early redemption of senior notes in  operating income for the year ended december  increased million or percent from the prior year 
the favorable variance was primarily due to incremental volume related to the acquisition of the wausau brands  higher average net price for both businesses and lower manufacturing input costs in our fine paper business  partially offset by additional costs related to the acquisition of the wausau brands  including higher selling  general and administrative sg a spending and non cash charges for the revaluation of inventory and profit in inventory 
analysis of net sales years ended december   and the following table presents net sales by segment  expressed as a percentage of total net sales before intersegment eliminations year ended december  technical products fine paper other total

consolidated net sales also benefitted from a more favorable product mix in our technical products business and higher average selling prices for both businesses  partially offset by unfavorable currency exchange effects 
net sales in our technical products business decreased million  or three percent  as higher average net price was more than offset by unfavorable currency exchange effects and lower shipment volume 
the higher average net price reflected a more favorable product mix due to growth in transportation filtration  labels and medical packaging products and a one percent increase in average selling prices 
unfavorable currency exchange effects reflected an eight percent weakening of the euro relative to the us dollar during shipment volumes decreased less than one percent from the prior year as strong growth in transportation filtration  wall covering  medical packaging products and label shipments was more than offset by lower tape and abrasive volume 
net sales in our fine paper business increased million or percent from the prior year primarily due to incremental volume related to the acquisition of the wausau brands and strong growth in packaging  label and premium branded shipments 
average net price was marginally higher than the prior year as higher average selling prices more than offset a product mix that included a higher proportion of lower priced products 
other net sales were million and reflected sales volume for the acquired index  tag and vellum bristol brands acquired from wausau

table of contents net sales in our fine paper business increased million  or approximately one percent  due to higher average net selling prices partially offset by a six percent decrease in shipment volume 
average net price was more than two percent higher than the prior year due to higher average selling prices and a more favorable product mix 
the lower shipment volume was primarily due to a general decline in shipments for the premium fine paper market and a reduction in lower value special make sales in the general decline in shipment volume due to market conditions was partially offset by increased revenue from a new envelope program and strong growth in luxury packaging and premium label shipments 
analysis of operating income years ended december   and the following table sets forth line items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated and is intended to provide a perspective of trends in our historical results year ended december  net sales cost of products sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses serp settlement charge acquisition integration costs loss on retirement of bonds gain on sale of ripon mill other income expense net operating income interest expense net income from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes income from continuing operations

we believe that by adjusting reported operating income to exclude the effects of these items  the resulting adjusted operating income is on a basis that reflects the results of our ongoing operations 
we believe that providing adjusted operating results will help investors gain an additional perspective of underlying business trends and results 
adjusted operating income is not a recognized term under gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income derived in accordance with gaap 
other companies may use different methodologies for calculating their non gaap financial measures and  accordingly  our non gaap financial measures may not be comparable to their measures

for the year ended december  sg a expense as a percentage of net sales was approximately percent and was percentage points lower than the prior year primarily due to cost control initiatives and higher sales 
for the years ended december   and  we incurred million  million and million of interest expense  respectively 
the year over year decrease in interest expense for each year was primarily due to lower average debt levels and lower weighted average interest rates due to the early redemption of senior notes 
in general  our effective tax rate differs from the us statutory tax rate of percent primarily due to the benefits of our corporate tax structure and the proportion of pre tax income in jurisdictions with marginal tax rates that differ from the us statutory tax rate

for a reconciliation of effective tax rate to the us federal statutory tax rate  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  income taxes 
our consolidated effective tax rate is expected to increase to approximately percent in the increase is primarily due to the us taxation of increased cash repatriation from germany and the impact of new german tax legislation which will eliminate certain previously allowable interest expense deductions

for the years ended december  and  cash flow used in financing activities included million and million  respectively for the redemption of senior notes 
on october   we entered into the second amended and restated credit agreement 
the second amended and restated credit agreement  among other things i extends the term of the prior credit facility by two years  ii increases the revolving credit commitment from million to million  iii adds a million deferred draw term loan commitment  borrowings under which were used to redeem a portion of our senior notes  iv reduces certain interest rates and fees payable by the borrowers on revolving credit borrowings  v removes neenah canada as a guarantor and releases liens and security interests previously granted by neenah canada  and vi makes certain definitional  administrative and covenant changes 
the revolving credit commitment includes a million sublimit for letters of credit 
the term loan was drawn in a single draw in november  and is subject to certain borrowing conditions 
the principal balance of the term loan is repayable in quarterly installments beginning on march  both the revolving credit commitment and the term loan mature on november  or on august   if by that date the senior notes have not been redeemed  repurchased  defeased or repaid in full  or extended or refinanced to a date at least days after november  
availability under our revolving credit facility varies over time depending on the value of our inventory  receivables and various capital assets 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our revolver  outstanding letters of credit and other items of million and million of available credit 
in addition  we had no amounts outstanding under the german lines of credit and million million  based on exchanges rates at december  of available credit 
we have required debt payments through december  of million  including million to repay the senior notes in november  and for required amortization payments on the term loan and our german loan agreement of million and million  respectively

for the year ended december   cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million at december  from million at december  and debt decreased million to million at december  from million at december  net debt total debt minus cash and cash equivalents increased by million as higher operating income was more than offset by increased investments in working capital and costs related to the acquisition of the wausau brands

in january  the restricted cash was used to pay postretirement pension benefits 

table of contents as of december   our cash balance of million consists of million in the us and million held at entities outside of the us as of december  there were no restrictions regarding the repatriation of our non us cash  however  if we repatriated these cash balances to the us  we would incur additional income tax expense 
third party transactions for the year ended december   we redeemed million in aggregate principal amount of the senior notes 
the redemption was financed by a combination of borrowings using our revolving credit facility and our million term loan 
in addition  from time to time  we may be in the market for the purpose of repurchasing our senior notes 
any such purchases are not expected to have a material effect on our liquidity 
transactions with shareholders for the years ended december  and  we paid cash dividends of per common share or approximately million and per common share or approximately million  respectively 
in november  our board of directors approved a twenty five percent increase in the annual dividend on our common stock to per share 
the dividend will be paid in four equal quarterly installments beginning in march as of december   under the most restrictive terms of the indenture for the senior notes  our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock is limited to a total of million in a month period 
however  we can pay dividends in excess of million in a month period by making restricted payments as defined in the indenture for the senior notes 
in may  we announced the stock purchase plan that would allow for the purchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock through may  the timing and amount of any purchases will depend on share price  market conditions and other factors

in addition  we received million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 
for the year ended december   we recognized excess tax benefits of million related to the vesting or exercise of stock based awards 
management believes that our ability to generate cash from operations and our borrowing capacity are adequate to fund working capital  capital spending and other cash needs for the next months 
our ability to generate adequate cash from operations beyond will depend on  among other things  our ability to successfully implement our business strategies  control costs in line with market conditions and manage the impact of changes in input prices and currencies 
we can give no assurance we will be able to successfully implement these items 
other items as of december   we had million of us federal and million of state net operating losses nols  respectively 
if not used  substantially all of the nols will expire in various amounts between and in december  the irs issued a revenue agent report for the and tax years 
we submitted a protest to the appeals division of the irs with respect to certain unresolved issues which involve a proposed irs adjustment with respect to dual consolidated losses dcls and the recapture of net operating losses emanating from our former canadian operations 
our protest asserted that the irs made several errors in its assessment of the dcl rules and  as such  the proposed adjustment was erroneous 
in november  our protest was upheld and the audit of the and tax years was finalized with a finding of no additional taxes due 

table of contents in november  we received a tax examination report from the german tax authorities challenging the validity of certain interest expense deductions claimed on our tax returns for the years and we are indemnified by fibermark  inc for any tax liabilities arising from the operations of neenah germany prior to october in august  we received tax assessments totaling million from the german tax authorities and submitted an appeal challenging these assessments 
we believe that the finding which invalidates the deductibility of certain interest expense deductions is improper and are vigorously contesting the finding 
as of december   no amounts were reserved related to these issues 
in november and january  we paid a total of million against the august tax assessments 
we reflected these payments as assets million in income taxes receivable on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  in recognition that such amounts would be treated as prepayments against any assessments ultimately owed 
during  we submitted additional information to the german tax authorities to support the validity of our interest expense deductions  however  as of december   they had not rendered a decision on our appeal 
in the fourth quarter of  legislation was proposed in the german legislature that would eliminate certain previously allowable interest expense deductions on a prospective and retroactive basis 
the legislation was subsequently enacted in the first quarter of we believe the retroactive application of the legislation is unconstitutional and the likelihood of it being sustained is remote 
as of december   we recorded a liability for uncertain income tax positions based on an assessment of the likelihood of alternative outcomes  including  the possibility of a potential compromise related to this issue for the and tax years and for subsequent periods through we believe it is remote that our liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to these matters will significantly increase within the next months 
while we believe that retroactive application of this legislation is remote  should retroactive application of the legislation be sustained  the outcome could have a material effect on our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
contractual obligations the following table presents the total contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed or determinable as of december  in millions jul beyond total long term debt payments interest payments on long term debt a open purchase orders b other post employment benefit obligations c contributions to pension trusts liability for uncertain tax positions minimum purchase commitments d operating leases total contractual obligations a interest payments on long term debt includes interest on variable rate debt at december  weighted average interest rates 
b the open purchase orders displayed in the table represent amounts we anticipate will become payable within the next months for goods and services that we have negotiated for delivery 
c the above table includes future payments that we will make for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
those amounts are estimated using actuarial assumptions  including expected future service  to project the future obligations 
d the minimum purchase commitments in and are primarily for coal contracts 
although we are primarily liable for payments on the above operating leases and minimum purchase commitments  based on historic operating performance and forecasted future cash flows  we believe our exposure to losses  if any  under these arrangements is not material 

table of contents adoption of new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
asu no 
which amends asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other testing goodwill for impairment asc topic 
asu topic no 
permits an entity first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test 
if  after assessing the totality of events and circumstances  an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  then the entity is not required to take further action 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount  as described in asc topic under asu no 
 an entity has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test 
an entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
asu no 
is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  early adoption is permitted  including for annual and interim impairment tests performed as of a date before july   if a public entity financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued 
the company adopted asu no 
in its annual financial statements for the year ending december  the adoption of asu no 
did not affect the company financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates  and changes in these estimates are recorded when known 
the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments with regard to estimates used 
these critical judgments relate to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of expenses 
the following summary provides further information about the critical accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the consistent application of our policies provides readers of our financial statements with useful and reliable information about our operating results and financial condition 
we have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with our board of directors and audit committee 
inventories we value us inventories at the lower of cost  using the last in  first out lifo method for financial reporting purposes  or market 
german inventories are valued at the lower of cost  using a weighted average cost method  or market 
the first in  first out value of us inventories valued on the lifo method was million and million at december  and  respectively and exceeded such lifo value by million and million  respectively 
cost includes labor  materials and production overhead 
income taxes as of december   we have recorded aggregate deferred income tax assets of million related to temporary differences  net operating losses and credits 
we have established a valuation allowance of million against certain state deferred income tax assets in states where we no longer have operations 
as of december   our aggregate deferred income tax assets were million and had a valuation allowance against such deferred income tax assets of million 
in determining the need for a valuation allowance  we consider many factors  including specific taxing jurisdictions  sources of taxable income  income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction 
a valuation allowance would be recognized if  based on the weight of available evidence  we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
as of december  and  our liability for uncertain income taxes positions was million and million  respectively 
in evaluating and estimating tax positions and tax benefits  we consider many factors which may result in periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 

table of contents pension and other postretirement benefits pension plans substantially all active employees of our us operations participate in defined benefit pension plans and or defined contribution retirement plans 
neenah germany has defined benefit plans designed to provide a monthly pension benefit upon retirement to substantially all of its employees in germany 
in addition  we maintain a supplemental retirement contribution plan the serp which is a non qualified defined benefit plan 
we provide benefits under the serp to the extent necessary to fulfill the intent of our defined benefit retirement plans without regard to the limitations set by the irs on qualified defined benefit plans 
our funding policy for qualified defined benefit plans is to contribute assets to fully fund the accumulated benefit obligation  as required by the pension protection act of subject to regulatory and tax deductibility limits  any funding shortfall is to be eliminated over a reasonable number of years 
nonqualified plans providing pension benefits in excess of limitations imposed by the taxing authorities are not funded 
there is no legal or governmental obligation to fund neenah germany benefit plans and as such the plans are currently unfunded 
consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the weighted average expected long term rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense was percent  percent and percent for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the expected long term rate of return on pension fund assets held by our pension trusts was determined based on several factors  including input from pension investment consultants and projected long term returns of broad equity and bond indices 
we also considered the plans historical year and year compounded annual returns 
we anticipate that  on average  actively managed us pension plan assets will generate annual long term rates of return of at least percent 
our expected long term rate of return on the assets in the plans is based on an asset allocation assumption of about percent with equity managers  with expected long term rates of return of approximately to percent  and percent with fixed income managers  with an expected long term rate of return of approximately to percent 
the actual asset allocation is regularly reviewed and periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
we evaluate our investment strategy and long term rate of return on pension asset assumptions at least annually 
pension expense is estimated based on the fair value of assets rather than a market related value that averages gains and losses over a period of years 
investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the fair value of the assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets 
the variance between the actual and the expected gains and losses on pension assets is recognized in pension expense more rapidly than it would be if a market related value for plan assets was used 
as of december   our pension plans had cumulative unrecognized investment losses and other actuarial losses of approximately million 
these unrecognized net losses may increase our future pension expense if not offset by i actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns  ii other factors  including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate our pension obligations or iii other actuarial gains  including whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the corridor determined under asc topic the discount or settlement rate that is utilized for determining the present value of future pension obligations in the us is generally based on the yield for a theoretical basket of aa rated corporate bonds currently available in the market place  whose duration matches the timing of expected pension benefit payments 
the discount or settlement rate that is utilized for determining the present value of future pension obligations in germany is generally based on the iboxx index of aa rated corporate bonds adjusted to match the timing of expected pension benefit payments 
the weighted average discount rate utilized to determine the present value of future pension obligations at december  and was percent and percent  respectively 
our consolidated pension expense in is based on the expected weighted average long term rate of return on assets and the weighted average discount rate described above and various other assumptions 
pension expense beyond will depend on future investment performance  our contributions to the pension trusts  changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans 

table of contents the fair value of the assets in our defined benefit plans at december  of approximately million increased approximately million from the fair value of about million at december   as investment gains and employer contributions exceeded benefit payments 
at december   the projected benefit obligations of our defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by approximately million which was approximately million larger than the million deficit at december  the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets by approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
contributions to pension trusts for the year ended december  were million compared with million for the year ended december  in addition  we made direct benefit payments for unfunded qualified and supplemental retirement benefits of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
other postretirement benefit plans we maintain postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans for active employees and former employees of our canadian pulp operations 
the plans are generally noncontributory for employees who were eligible to retire on or before december  and contributory for most employees who became eligible to retire on or after january  we do not provide a subsidized postretirement health care or life insurance benefit to most employees hired after our postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans are unfunded 
for the years ended december   and  consolidated postretirement health care and life insurance plan benefit expense was million  million and million  respectively 
the weighted average discount or settlement rate used to calculate postretirement health care and life insurance plan benefit expense was percent  percent and percent for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the discount or settlement rate that is utilized for determining the present value of future postretirement health care and life insurance plan benefit obligations in the us is generally based on the yield for a theoretical basket of aa rated corporate bonds currently available in the market place  whose duration matches the timing of expected postretirement health care and life insurance benefit payments 
the discount or settlement rate that is utilized for determining the present value of future postretirement health care and life insurance obligations for our foreign benefit plans is generally based on an index of aa rated corporate bonds adjusted to match the timing of expected benefit payments 
our consolidated postretirement health care and life insurance plan benefit expense in is based on the weighted average discount rate described above and various other assumptions 
postretirement health care and life insurance plan benefit expense beyond will depend on future health care cost trends  changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans 
our obligations for postretirement health care and life insurance plan benefits are measured annually as of december the weighted average discount rate utilized to determine the present value of future postretirement health care and life insurance obligations at december  and was percent and percent  respectively 
the assumed inflationary health care cost trend rates used to determine obligations at december  and costs for the year ended december  were percent gradually decreasing to an ultimate rate of percent in the assumed inflationary health care cost trend rates used to determine obligations at december  and costs for the year ended december  were percent gradually decreasing to an ultimate rate of percent in at december   the projected benefit obligations for our postretirement health care and life insurance plans was approximately million and was million larger than the projected benefit obligation at december  primarily due to actuarial losses related to the reduction in the weighted average discount or settlement rate used to calculate postretirement health care and life insurance plan benefit 
impairment of long lived assets property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are tested for impairment in accordance with asc topic  property  plant  and equipment asc topic  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such long lived assets may not be recoverable from future net pre tax cash flows 
impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating the future success of product lines  future sales volumes  growth rates for selling prices and costs  alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets 
impairment testing is conducted at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured and are independent of cash flows of other assets 
an asset impairment would be indicated if the sum of the expected future net pre tax cash flows from the use of the asset undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
an impairment loss would be measured based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount 
we determine fair value based on an expected present value technique using multiple cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes and a risk free rate of interest are used to estimate fair value 

table of contents the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis are consistent with the business plans and estimates we use to manage our business operations 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and would increase or decrease the impairment charge 
actual outcomes may differ from the estimates 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives goodwill arising from a business combination is recorded as the excess of purchase price and related costs over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in accordance with asc topic  business combinations asc topic 
all of our goodwill was acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of neenah germany in october under asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc topic  goodwill is subject to impairment testing at least annually 
asc topic provides an entity with the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
if the two step impairment test is necessary  a fair value based test is applied at the reporting unit level  which is generally one level below the operating segment level 
the test compares the fair value of an entity reporting units to the carrying value of those reporting units 
this test requires various judgments and estimates 
the company estimates the fair value of the reporting unit using a market approach in combination with a discounted operating cash flow approach 
impairment of goodwill is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over the fair values of recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
an adjustment to goodwill will be recorded for any goodwill that is determined to be impaired 
the company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually on november in conjunction with preparation of its annual business plan  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it might be impaired 
at november   the company assessment of qualitative facts and circumstances indicated no impairment of goodwill 
the qualitative factors that we considered included  but were not limited to  changes in the macroeconomic conditions  changes in industry and market conditions such as an increase in the competitive environment  changes in manufacturing input costs particularly to the extent these cannot be recovered through higher prices  changes in our market capitalization and changes in financial performance including earnings and cash flows 
certain trade names are estimated to have indefinite useful lives and as such are not amortized 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are annually reviewed for impairment in accordance with asc topic our annual test of goodwill for impairment at november   and indicated that the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to neenah germany was considered recoverable 
at november   the significant assumptions used in developing the discounted operating cash flow approach were revenue growth rates and pricing  costs for manufacturing inputs  levels of capital investment and estimated cost of capital for high  medium and low growth environments 
other intangible assets with finite lives acquired intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with asc topic intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships  trade names and acquired intellectual property 
such intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of between and years 
our annual test of other intangible assets for impairment at november   and indicated that the carrying amount of such assets was recoverable 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc topic 
the amount of stock based compensation cost recognized is based on the fair value of grants that are ultimately expected to vest and is recognized pro rata over the requisite service period for the entire award 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a multinational enterprise  we are exposed to risks such as changes in commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and environmental regulation 
a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks  including operating and financing activities and  where deemed appropriate  the use of derivative instruments 
derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation or trading 
presented below is a description of our most significant risks 
foreign currency risk our reported operating results are affected by changes in the exchange rates of the local currencies of our non us operations relative to the us dollar 
for the year ended december   a hypothetical percent increase in the exchange rates of the u 
s dollar relative to the local currencies of our non us operations would have decreased our income before income taxes by approximately million 
we do not hedge our exposure to exchange risk on reported operating results 
the translation of the balance sheets of our non us operations from their local currencies into us dollars is also sensitive to changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar 
consequently  we performed a sensitivity test to determine if changes in the exchange rate would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of our non us operations into non us dollars 
these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments uta  a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity 
the hypothetical change in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of our non us operations by a percent change in the exchange rate of their local currencies versus the us dollar 
as of december   the net assets of our non us operations exceeded their net liabilities by approximately million 
as of december   a percent decrease in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the local currencies of our non us operations would have decreased our stockholders equity by approximately million 
commodity risk pulp we purchase the wood pulp used to produce our products on the open market  and  as a result  the price and other terms of those purchases are subject to change based on factors such as worldwide supply and demand and government regulation 
we do not have significant influence over the price paid for our wood pulp purchases 
therefore  an increase in wood pulp prices could occur at the same time that prices for our products are decreasing and have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
based on pulp purchases  a percent increase in the average market price for pulp approximately per ton would have increased our annual costs for pulp purchases by approximately million 
other manufacturing inputs we purchase a substantial portion of the other manufacturing inputs necessary to produce our products on the open market  and  as a result  the price and other terms of those purchases are subject to change based on factors such as worldwide supply and demand and government regulation 
we do not have significant influence over our costs for such manufacturing inputs 
therefore  an increase in other manufacturing inputs could occur at the same time that prices for our products are decreasing and have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
our technical products business acquires certain of its specialized pulp requirements from two global suppliers and certain critical specialty latex grades from four suppliers 
in general  these supply arrangements are not covered by formal contracts  but represent multi year business relationships that have historically been sufficient to meet our needs 
we expect these relationships to continue to operate in a satisfactory manner in the future 
in the event of an interruption of production at any one supplier  we believe that each of these suppliers individually would be able to satisfy our short term requirements for specialized pulp or specialty latex 
in the event of a long term disruption in our supply of specialized pulp or specialty latex  we believe we would be able to substitute other pulp grades or other latex grades that would allow us to meet required product performance characteristics and incur only a limited disruption in our production 
as a result  we do not believe that the substitution of such alternative pulp or latex grades would have a material effect on our operations 
cotton fiber represents less than five percent of the total fiber requirements of our fine paper business 
our fine paper business acquires a substantial majority of the cotton fiber used in the production of certain branded bond paper products pursuant to annual agreements with two north american producers 
the balance of our cotton fiber requirements are acquired through spot market purchases from a variety of other producers 
we believe that a partial or total disruption in the production of cotton fibers at our two primary suppliers would increase our reliance on spot market purchases with a likely corresponding increase in cost 
since we have the ability to source cotton fiber on the spot market if faced with a supply disruption  we would not expect cotton fiber supply issues to have a material effect on our operations 

table of contents we generate substantially all of the electrical energy used by our munising mill and approximately percent and percent of the electrical energy at our appleton and bruckm hl mills  respectively 
availability of energy is not expected to be a problem in the foreseeable future  but the purchase price of such energy can and likely will fluctuate significantly based on fluctuations in demand and other factors 
there is no assurance that that we will be able to obtain electricity or natural gas purchases on favorable terms in the future 
except for certain specialty latex grades and specialty softwood pulp used by our technical products business and cotton fiber used by our fine paper business  we are not aware of any significant concentration of business transacted with a particular supplier 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our variable rate bank debt 
at december   we had million of variable rate borrowings outstanding 
a basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense on outstanding variable rate borrowings by approximately million 
environmental regulation climate change legislation our manufacturing operations are subject to extensive regulation primarily by us  german and other international authorities 
we have made significant capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws  rules and regulations 
due to changes in environmental laws and regulations  including potential future legislation to limit ghg emissions  the application of such regulations and changes in environmental control technology  we are not able to predict with certainty the amount of future capital spending to be incurred for environmental purposes 
taking these uncertainties into account  we have planned capital expenditures for environmental projects during the period through of approximately million to million annually 
we believe these risks can be managed and will not have a material effect on our business or our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
