item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of various important factors  including those discussed below and those discussed in the section entitled risk factors included in item a of part of this report 
due to the fact that we have not generated any revenue  we believe that the financial information contained in this report is not indicative of  or comparable to  the financial profile that we expect to have if and when we begin to generate revenue 
we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
overview we are a next generation renewable fuels company 
we have developed a proprietary catalytic process that allows us to produce cellulosic gasoline and diesel from abundant  lignocellulosic biomass 
our cellulosic gasoline and diesel are true hydrocarbon fuels which are similar to their traditional petroleum based counterparts and yet result in over less life cycle greenhouse gas emissions 
while other renewable fuels are derived from soft starches  such as corn starch or cane sugar  for ethanol  or from soy and other vegetable oils for biodiesel  cellulosic fuel is derived from lignocellulose found in wood  grasses and the non edible portions of plants 
our biomass to cellulosic fuel technology platform combines our proprietary catalyst systems with fcc processes that have been used in crude oil refineries to produce gasoline for over years 
in april  we mechanically completed our initial scale commercial production facility in columbus  mississippi 
this first facility is designed to produce up to million gallons of cellulosic diesel and gasoline per year 
during the fourth quarter of  we successfully commissioned our proprietary bfcc operation  and produced our first on spec cellulosic intermediate oil in limited quantities 
subsequent to year end  we successfully commissioned the plant s hydrotreater and fractionation units  and began our first cellulosic diesel shipments in march we have had limited continuous production at our columbus facility and are not yet in steady state production 
we currently intend to begin construction of our planned first standard commercial production facility in natchez  mississippi in the second half of  subject to our ability to raise capital 
we are designing our natchez facility to produce up to million gallons of cellulosic diesel and gasoline per year  approximately three times the amount of our columbus facility 
we believe the natchez facility will be the model for our standard commercial facilities in order to take advantage of economies of scale 
our business plan contemplates that we will need to raise additional funds to build our planned standard commercial production facilities and subsequent facilities  continue the development of our technology and products and commercialize any products resulting from our research and development efforts 
we were incorporated and commenced operations in july since our inception  we have operated as a development stage company  performing extensive research and development to develop  enhance  refine and commercialize our biomass to cellulosic fuel technology platform 
until recently  we have focused our efforts on research and development and the construction of our columbus facility 
as a result  we have generated million of operating losses and an accumulated deficit of million from our inception through december  we expect to continue to incur operating losses through at least as we continue into the commercialization stage of our business 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
the results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to a full understanding and evaluation of our reported financial results and reflect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventories inventory is valued at standard cost  which approximates actual cost computed on a first in  first out basis  not in excess of cost or net realizable market value 
inventories  which consist of cellulosic gasoline  diesel and fuel oil  renewable crude oil  renewable cellulosic biomass primarily pine logs and wood chips  and catalyst  are categorized as finished goods  work in process or raw material inventories 
inventory costs include transportation  chipping and overhead costs incurred during production 
impairment of long lived assets and intangible assets we assess impairment of long lived assets  including intangible assets  on at least an annual basis and test long lived assets for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
circumstances which could trigger a review include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market price of the asset  significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors  accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset  a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset  or expectations that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life 

table of contents recoverability is assessed by using undiscounted future net cash flows of assets grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets 
if the undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  the asset is deemed impaired 
the amount of the impairment is measured as the difference between carrying value and the fair value of the asset 
the majority of our long lived assets  other than intangible assets  consist of our initial scale commercial production facility  demonstration unit  and pilot unit 
the demonstration and pilot units are variations of common refinery equipment used in technology development and scale up of processes that have been scaled and modified for our research and development purposes 
our intangible assets consist of purchased biomass conversion technology and technology licenses 
given our history of operating losses  we evaluated the recoverability of the book value of our property  plant and intangible assets by performing an undiscounted forecasted cash flow analysis 
based on our analysis  the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is in excess of the book value of the property  plant and equipment and intangible assets 
accordingly  no impairment charges have been recorded during the period from july  date of inception through december  our undiscounted cash flow analysis involves significant estimates and judgments 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans  there is significant exercise of judgment involved in determining the cash flow attributable to a long lived asset over its estimated remaining useful life 
our estimates of anticipated cash flows could be reduced significantly in the future 
as a result  the carrying amounts of our long lived assets could be reduced through impairment charges in the future 
changes in estimated future cash flows could also result in a shortening of the estimated useful life of long lived assets  including intangibles  for depreciation and amortization purposes 
stock based compensation compensation cost for grants of all share based payments is based on the estimated grant date fair value 
we attribute the value of share based compensation to expense using the straight line method 
we estimate the fair value of our share based payment awards using the black scholes option pricing model the black scholes model 
the black scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
the black scholes model requires the input of certain assumptions  including assumptions relating to the risk free interest rate  the expected term and expected volatility which materially affect the fair value estimates 
the risk free interest rate was based on the market yield currently available on united states treasury securities with maturities approximately equal to the option s expected term 
expected term represents the period that our stock based awards are expected to be outstanding 
the simplified method was used to calculate the expected term 
historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term  as we are a development stage company and fair market value of shares granted changed from our historical grants as a result of our initial public offering in june the expected volatility was based on the historical stock volatilities of several comparable publicly traded companies over a period equal to the expected terms of the options  as we do not have a long trading history to use to estimate the volatility of our own common stock 
our expected dividend yield was assumed to be zero as we have not paid  and do not anticipate paying  cash dividends on our shares of common stock 
we estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures and will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience  analysis of employee turnover and other factors 
quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stock based compensation expense  as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate  an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate  an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
we will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility  lives  forfeiture and dividend rate related to our stock based compensation on a prospective basis and incorporating these factors into our option pricing model 
each of these inputs is subjective and generally requires significant management and director judgment to determine 
if  in the future  we determine that another method for calculating the fair value of our stock options is more reasonable  or if another method for calculating these input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance  and  therefore  should be used to estimate expected volatility or expected term  the fair value calculated for our stock options could change significantly 
higher volatility and longer expected terms generally result in an increase to stock based compensation expense determined at the date of grant 
under the stock option stock issuance plan  or the plan  there remains million in unrecognized stock based compensation cost that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share based compensation arrangements granted under the plan 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
under the long term incentive plan  or the plan  there is a remaining million in unrecognized stock based compensation cost that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share based compensation arrangements granted under the plan 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 

table of contents in march  the compensation committee of the board of directors approved the performance metrics for our company annual incentive plan  or the incentive plan 
our officers and key employees participated in the incentive plan 
the purpose of the incentive plan is to incentivize performance by our officers and key employees during to achieve our short term and strategic goals and to align the interest of our officers and key employees with the interest of our stockholders 
each participant in the incentive plan is given a target bonus and awards under the incentive plan are paid out in shares of class a common stock under our plan 
participants in the incentive plan have the ability to receive up to of the target number of shares 
in march  our compensation committee determined that the performance goals for were partially met and granted fully vested shares of class a common stock to the plan participants who were still our employees at the time of grant 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states 
prior to december   our wholly owned subsidiary  kior b 
v in liquidation was subject to income taxes in the netherlands 
as of december   all of the operations of kior bv in liquidation were combined with the operations of kior  inc we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes  whereby deferred tax asset or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expenses for tax and financial statement purposes 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
recognition of deferred tax assets is appropriate when realization of such assets is more likely than not 
we recognize a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable 
this assessment requires judgment as to the likelihood and amounts of future taxable income by tax jurisdiction 
at december  and  we had a full valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets  including our net operating loss carryforwards 
we make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted 
any adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the income statement for the periods in which the adjustment is determined to be required 
we assess all material positions taken in any income tax return  including all significant uncertain positions  in all tax years that are still subject to assessment or challenge by relevant taxing authorities 
assessing an uncertain tax position begins with the initial determination of the position s sustainability and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
as of each balance sheet date  unresolved uncertain tax positions must be reassessed  and we will determine whether i the factors underlying the sustainability assertion have changed and ii the amount of the recognized tax benefit is still appropriate 
the recognition and measurement of tax benefits requires significant judgment 
judgments concerning the recognition and measurement of a tax benefit might change as new information becomes available 
we believe that it is more likely than not that our income tax positions and deductions will be sustained following an audit 
therefore  we have not recorded any liabilities in any of the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues years ended december  year to year change dollars in thousands revenues product revenue n a renewable identification number revenue n a total operating expenses our product revenue increased by  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in as we recorded our first product revenue in november all revenues from external customers in the year ended december  are attributable to customers in the united states 
in november  we entered into a contract whereby we sold  gallons of our cellulosic diesel produced from our research and development facilities to an obligated third party to blend with  gallons of diesel 
we then purchased the blended diesel from the obligated third party for sale to one of our offtake customers for fleet testing 
during the fourth quarter of  we sold  gallons of this blended diesel  of which approximately gallons was our cellulosic diesel 
revenue consisted of our fuel price plus incremental fees incurred to purchase diesel and costs to blend it with our cellulosic diesel 
we expect to sell the remaining blended diesel in the first quarter of to complete the fleet testing 
in addition  we generated and sold  cellulosic diesel rins in the fourth quarter of we expect that our revenues from sales of cellulosic gasoline and diesel and rins will be limited and unpredictable  at least in the near term  as we continue in the start up phase at our initial scale commercial production facility 

table of contents operating expenses years ended december  year to year change dollars in thousands operating expenses cost of product revenue n a research and development expenses general and administrative expenses total operating expenses cost of product revenue 
our cost of product revenue increased by  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in as discussed above  we entered into a contract whereby we blended cellulosic diesel produced from our research and development facilities with third party diesel for sale to one of our offtake customers for fleet testing 
cost of product revenue primarily consists of costs incurred to purchase diesel to blend with our cellulosic diesel plus blending costs 
costs incurred to purchase diesel for blending plus blending costs are only expected if we blend the product ourselves prior to the sale 
research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses increased by million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in this increase was primarily the result of a million increase in payroll and related expenses 
during  we increased our research and development staff to approximately employees compared to approximately employees at december  payroll and related expenses in included stock based compensation of million compared to million in the increase in is also related to operating costs and maintenance associated with our research and development facilities  which increased by approximately million 
in late  we expanded and commissioned a hydrotreater in our demonstration unit  providing a fully integrated manufacturing process from wood yard to the tanks and it is now operating at capacity 
also  in late  we added a new analytical lab that is now fully operational 
there was an increase of million to depreciation and amortization expense allocated research and development for the year ended december  compared to the same period in caused by additions to fixed assets  consisting primarily of expansions to our demonstration unit and pilot plant  the addition of a new analytical lab and new laboratory equipment  and leasehold improvements at our pasadena  texas facility 
the increase in research and development expenses was partially offset by a million decrease in laboratory testing expenses due to the expansion of our pilot and demonstration units which reduced our utilization of third party facilities for the hydrotreating and fractionating processes 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in this increase was primarily the result of million of start up costs  an increase of million compared to the same period in  incurred at our initial scale commercial production facility in columbus  mississippi that we mechanically completed in april and completed commissioning in september the facility is in the start up phase  which consists of operating the facility in the manner for which it was designed and identifying and addressing issues that cannot be identified during commissioning 
the increase in general and administrative expenses is also due to an increase of million in payroll and related expenses  excluding payroll and related expenses for our columbus employees that are included in start up costs 
payroll and related expenses included stock based compensation of million compared to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the remaining increase in general and administrative expenses primarily relates to costs incurred operating as a public company for the entire period in other income expense  net years ended december  year to year change dollars in thousands other income expense  net interest income interest expense  net of amounts capitalized n a loss from change in fair value of warrant liability other income expense  net interest income 
interest income increased by  for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the increase is primarily due to twelve months of our investment of the proceeds from our initial public offering and loan and security agreement in money market accounts during the twelve months ended december  compared to investing only initial public offering proceeds for approximately half a year during the same period in 
table of contents interest expense  net of amounts capitalized 
interest expense increased by approximately  for the year ended december  compared to as we were unable to capitalize all of our interest during the year ended december  due to additional interest expense recorded for the termination of our business loan as defined below 
loss from change in fair value of warrant liability 
the loss from change in fair value of warrant liability expense decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the change is related to the change in fair value of our convertible preferred stock warrants  which were recorded as derivatives and reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability prior to the warrants converting into warrants to purchase common stock upon conversion of our convertible preferred stock at the close of our initial public offering 
we performed our final mark to market adjustment on the convertible preferred stock warrant liability on june   the date the initial public offering closed  reducing our convertible preferred stock warrant liability to zero 
comparison of years ended december  and operating expenses years ended december  year to year change dollars in thousands operating expenses research and development expenses general and administrative expenses total operating expenses research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses increased by million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in this increase was primarily the result of a million increase in payroll and related expenses due to an increase in headcount 
during  we increased our research and development staff to full time equivalents  or ftes  as compared to ftes at december  payroll and related expenses in included stock based compensation of million compared to million in during  we continued to expand our research and development efforts as we focused more on commercialization of our technology 
our expenses related to laboratory testing  supplies  and chemicals in connection with testing biomass fuels for quality increased by million to million for the year ended december   from million in operating costs associated with our research and development facilities  which include startup and operation of our demonstration unit expansions  repairs  utilities  and supplies increased approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase in our research and development expenses was partially offset by a million decrease in our consulting fees to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in this decrease was primarily the result of preproduction design work for our first commercial production plant during the year ended december  that did not recur during the year ended december   as our initial scale commercial production plant was under construction and costs were being capitalized 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to this increase was primarily the result of a million increase in payroll and related expenses due to an increase in stock based compensation expense and increased headcount 
payroll and related expenses included stock based compensation of million compared to million for year ended december  and  respectively 
we had an increase in general and administrative expenses for consultants of million to million for the year ended december   from million in primarily driven by the hiring of consultants to assist with sarbanes oxley compliance implementation  support for our new enterprise resource planning system and product stewardship studies  and the hiring of marketing firms and engineers to assist with applying to various federal governmental agencies for grants and loan guarantees 
travel related expenses increased about million primarily as a result of business development and visits to the columbus  mississippi construction site 
we had an increase in general and administrative expenses for insurance of million during the year ended december  compared to primarily due to beginning the amortization of our d o insurance prepaid during june and an increase in our general liability insurance 
the remaining increase relates to recruiting fees  relocation expenses  office supplies  and office maintenance associated with increasing our headcount 

table of contents other income expense  net years ended december  year to year change dollars in thousands other income expense  net interest income beneficial conversion feature expense interest expense  net of amounts capitalized loss from change in fair value of warrant liability other income expense  net interest income 
the decrease in interest income of  or  is primarily due to us making more conservative investments and lower rate of returns 
beneficial conversion feature expense 
in august  we entered into a million non interest bearing convertible promissory note  or the note  which included a beneficial conversion feature  with our principal stockholder  khosla ventures 
the value of the beneficial conversion feature was not readily determinable upon issuance of the note because the conversion feature was contingent upon the occurrence of an undetermined future financing transaction and neither the timing nor value of such transaction could be estimated at the time the note was issued 
in april  we executed a financing transaction that required the note to be converted into million shares of our series b convertible preferred stock 
we recorded a million expense at the time of that conversion to reflect the beneficial conversion feature associated with the conversion of the note to convertible preferred stock 
interest expense  net of amounts capitalized 
interest expense decreased by approximately million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to interest expense of million recorded in the year ended december   which was associated with construction and equipment purchases for our initial scale commercial production facility in columbus  mississippi was capitalized as compared to million capitalized in the year ended december  loss from change in fair value of warrant liability 
the loss from change in fair value of warrant liability expense increased by million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the change is related to the change in fair value of our convertible preferred stock warrants  which are recorded as derivatives and reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability prior to the warrants converting into warrants to purchase common stock upon conversion of our convertible preferred stock at the close of our initial public offering 
we performed our final mark to market adjustment on the convertible preferred stock warrant liability on june   the date the initial public offering closed  reducing our convertible preferred stock warrant liability to zero 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have generated significant losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million and we expect to continue to incur operating losses through at least as we move into the commercialization stage of our business 
commercialization of our technology will require significant capital and other expenditures  including costs related to ongoing start up efforts at our initial scale commercial production facility and the planned construction of our first standard commercial production facility  which will require us to raise significant amounts of additional capital 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
in addition  in march  we entered into an amendment to our loan and security agreement which  among other things  increased the amount available under the facility by million to million 
we have already borrowed the full million that was previously available under this facility 
as a result of this amendment  we have the right to borrow additional amounts of up to million in the aggregate from khosla 
in order to borrow such additional amounts  i we must provide khosla with a near term cash flow forecast demonstrating the need for such advance  ii at the time of and after giving effect to such advance  no event of default as such term is defined under our loan and security agreement has occurred or is continuing  iii we must issue to khosla a subsequent drawdown warrant as defined below and iv we may not have consummated an offering of debt securities resulting in gross proceeds to us in an amount of million or more including any term loans excluding any paid in kind interest made by khosla under the loan and security agreement on or after the effective date amendment 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  our expected revenues from our initial scale commercial production facility and the additional million available under our loan and security agreement will enable us to meet our material liquidity needs through the next twelve months 
the foregoing excludes any capital required to fund the construction of our planned first standard commercial production facility in natchez  mississippi  the commencement of which is subject to our ability to raise additional capital 
we will need to raise additional outside capital to fund our operations and meet our material liquidity needs beyond the twelve month period 
in addition  to the extent our expected revenues from our columbus facility are lower than projected  we may need to obtain outside funding earlier than currently anticipated in order to meet our material liquidity needs 
our material liquidity needs over the next twelve months consist of the following funding our overhead costs  which we expect to be approximately million 
we do not expect to be able to generate sufficient revenue from the sale of our cellulosic gasoline and diesel to allow us to fund these costs from internally generated cash flows before the commencement of operations at our planned first standard commercial projection facility  which we expect will occur in the first half of 
table of contents funding our debt service costs  which we expect to be approximately million 
funding the start up of our columbus facility  including rentals  repairs  replacements  start up costs  consulting fees  overtime and other expenses attendant to commencing operations of the facility 
we estimate remaining costs will range between million and million 
in addition  we estimate that we will require approximately million to million  net of expected revenues  to fund operating costs at the columbus facility 
funding a portion of the front end capital expenditures for our planned first standard commercial production facility in natchez  mississippi  such as certain front end engineering and procurement services and long lead equipment 
we plan to spend approximately million on front end engineering for this project 
as discussed below  the commencement of construction of this facility is subject to our ability to raise additional capital 
the total cost of our planned first standard commercial production facility is estimated at million  comprised of million for the conversion plant and million for a centralized hydrotreating plant being designed with capacity for our planned first standard commercial production facility and a second  similarly sized facility 
subject to our ability to raise additional capital  we expect to begin construction of this facility in the second half of in the near term  our plan is to continue value engineering for this project and to explore sourcing options for long lead time procurement components 
we expect any financing for our planned first standard production facility will be contingent upon  among other things  successful fuel production at our columbus facility  entering into satisfactory feedstock supply and offtake agreements for the facility  receipt of necessary governmental and regulatory approvals and permits  any required equity financing  there being no material adverse effect on us or our industry including relevant commodity markets and general market conditions 
longer term  we also anticipate material liquidity needs for the construction of additional commercial production facilities 
we plan to raise capital in one or more external equity and or debt financings over the next nine months 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing timely or at all  we would have to delay  scale back or eliminate our construction plans for our first standard production facility and other future facilities  which would harm our business and prospects 
our ability to obtain additional external debt financing will be limited by the amount and terms of our existing borrowing arrangements and the fact that all of our assets have been pledged as collateral for these existing arrangements 
in addition  a failure to comply with the covenants under our existing debt instruments could result in an event of default 
furthermore  there are cross default provisions in certain of our existing debt instruments such that an event of default under one agreement or instrument could result in an event of default under another 
if an event of default resulted in the acceleration of all of our payment obligations under our debt instruments as of february   we would be required to pay our lenders an aggregate of million 
in the event of an acceleration of amounts due under our debt instruments as a result of an event of default  we may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to repay our indebtedness or to make any accelerated payments  and the lenders could seek to enforce their security interests in the collateral securing such indebtedness 
our failure to obtain additional external financing to fund our cash requirements would require us to delay or scale back our business plan  including our research and development programs  require us to reduce our overhead and other operating costs and cause noncompliance with our existing debt covenants which would have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects and financial condition 
we did not begin to produce or generate any revenue from sales of our cellulosic fuel at our initial scale commercial production facility until march and have only generated limited revenue to date 
we expect our revenues from our initial scale commercial production facility to be limited until we reach a steady state of operations and we do not expect to have positive cash flows at least until our natchez facility has been constructed and is operational 
even if we complete the start up of our initial scale commercial production facility  our catchlight offtake agreement and fedex master ground fuel supply agreement are subject to the satisfaction of various conditions  not all of which have been satisfied by us and some of which are in the control of the counterparties  before the counterparties are obligated to make payments to us thereunder

as agent and lender  and alberta ltd  as lender  which we refer to collectively as the alberta lenders  and kft trust  vinod khosla  trustee  or khosla  who we refer to  collectively with the alberta lenders  as the lenders 
pursuant to the loan and security agreement  the alberta lenders made a term loan to us in the principal amount of million and khosla made a term loan to us in the principal amount million  for a total of million in principal amount  which we refer to as the loan advance and which will be converted as described below 
at closing  we paid the lenders a facility charge in an amount equal to of the loan advance 

table of contents in march  we entered into an amendment to our loan and security agreement which  among other things  i increases the amount available under the facility by million  which we may borrow from khosla  based on our capital needs  before march   subject to the terms of the loan and security agreement  ii replaces the requirement to make installment payments of principal and interest with a single balloon payment at maturity  iii allows us to elect payment of paid in kind interest throughout the term of the loan  iv modifies certain financial and negative covenants  including a covenant that required us to complete an equity offering meeting certain conditions on or before march   v requires us to raise additional capital in the amount of million on or before march  unless we demonstrate three months cash on hand  vi increases by million the limit on the amount of capital expenditures we can make on our first standard commercial production facility prior to raising additional funds and vii provides for the conversion  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  of a the secured obligations and certain other amounts in connection therewith owed to certain of the lenders into the debt issued in connection with our financing of our natchez facility and b the secured obligations and certain other amounts in connection therewith owed to certain of the lenders into equity securities issued in connection with our financing of our natchez facility 
we refer to the agreement  as amended  as the loan and security agreement 
in connection with the amendment described above  we agreed to pay the alberta lenders  for costs and expenses and agreed to issue certain warrants as described below 
in order to borrow the additional amounts of up to million in the aggregate from khosla  i we must provide khosla with a near term cash flow forecast demonstrating the need for such borrowing  ii at the time of and after giving effect to such advance  no event of default as such term is defined under our loan and security agreement has occurred or is continuing  iii we must issue to khosla a subsequent drawdown warrant and iv we may not have consummated an offering of debt securities resulting in gross proceeds to us in an amount of million or more including any term loans excluding any paid in kind interest made by khosla under the loan and security agreement on or after the effective date of the amendment 
any additional borrowings from khosla are considered a part of the loan advance 
the loan advance bears interest from the funding date at per annum  which we refer to as the loan interest rate 
we agreed to pay interest on the loan advance in arrears on the first day of each month  beginning march  we may elect payment of paid in kind interest  instead of cash interest  during the term of the loan 
if we elect payment of paid in kind interest  we will issue subsequent pik warrants as defined below  that cover interest due over the following months and the interest is added to the principal balance of the loan 
the loan advance is payable in full at its stated maturity date of february  at our option  we may prepay the loan advance  in whole or in part including all accrued and unpaid interest at any time  subject to a prepayment premium if we prepay the loan advance prior to four years from the date of the loan 
the prepayment premium is equal to until the first anniversary of the date of the loan and security agreement  and decreases by on each subsequent anniversary 
we also agreed to pay the lenders an end of term charge equal to of the aggregate amount of all advances made plus all interest paid in kind instead of cash interest upon the earlier to occur of the maturity of the loan advance  prepayment in full of the loan advance  or when the loan advance becomes due and payable upon acceleration 
we are amortizing the end of charge term to interest expense and increasing the liability for the end of term charge over the life of the loan 
we had amortized approximately million as of december   which is included in the principal balance of the loan
