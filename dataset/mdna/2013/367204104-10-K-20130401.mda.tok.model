executive overview gas natural is a natural gas company  primarily operating local distribution companies in seven states and serving approximately  customers in total 
our natural gas utility subsidiaries are bangor gas company maine  brainard ohio  cut bank gas company montana  energy west  incorporated montana and wyoming  frontier natural gas north carolina  northeast ohio natural gas company ohio  orwell ohio and pennsylvania  and public gas company kentucky 
our operations also include production and marketing of natural gas  gas pipeline transmission  gathering and propane operations 
approximately of our revenues in were derived from our natural gas utility operations 
the following summarizes the critical events that impacted our results of operations during the year ended december  although it was negatively impacted during by unusually warm weather in most of our markets  gross margin increased by  as a result of customer growth in our north carolina and maine markets a  increase for a take or pay contract with a large customer in montana our newly formed lng business returned new revenue and gross margin the period includes the results of operations from pgc which was acquired on april  the period includes a full year of operations from our propane operations segment net income decreased  in primarily due to an increase in costs as follows operating expenses increased in compared to due to increases in bad debt expense including an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts for the  take or pay contract discussed above  and depreciation from increased capital expenditures the period includes the expenses of operations from pgc and a full year of operations from our propane operations segment costs related to acquisitions were significantly higher in than in we incurred costs in in connection with our ceo s stock sale which was completed during the second quarter of the average balance on our bank of america line of credit was higher in compared to  causing an increase in interest expense 
in addition  included a pre tax gain of  on the bargain purchase of the assets of independence oil lp gas  inc  which was offset in part in by an impairment charge of  in kykuit resources  our unconsolidated affiliate 
we are focused on building rate base profitably in all of our jurisdictions  maintaining cost discipline  adherence to safety standards  and generating recurring streams of earnings and cash flow that support our continued investment in fixed assets  as well as a return of capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends 
in addition  we are actively pursuing our acquisition strategy to further grow our operations 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  if any  at the date of the financial statements 
we analyze our estimates  including those related to regulatory assets and liabilities  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see a complete list of significant accounting policies in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
regulatory accounting our accounting policies historically reflect the effects of the rate making process in accordance with regulated operations asc 
our regulated natural gas segment continues to be cost of service rate regulated  and we believe the application of asc to that segment continues to be appropriate 
we must reaffirm this conclusion at each balance sheet date 
if  as a result of a change in circumstances  we determine that the regulated natural gas segment no longer meets the criteria of regulatory accounting under asc  that segment will have to discontinue regulatory accounting and write off the respective regulatory assets and liabilities 
the application of asc results in recording regulatory assets and liabilities 
regulatory assets represent the deferral of incurred costs that are probable of future recovery in customer rates 
in some cases  we record regulatory assets before we have received approval for recovery from the state regulatory agencies 
we must use judgment to conclude that costs deferred as regulatory assets are probable of future recovery 
we base this conclusion on certain factors  including changes in the regulatory environment  recent rate orders issued by regulatory agencies  and the status of any potential new legislation 
regulatory liabilities represent revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been incurred or for probable future refunds to customers 
at december   our total regulatory assets were million and our total regulatory liabilities were million 
a write off of the regulatory assets and liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
our natural gas segment contains regulated utility businesses in the states of kentucky  maine  montana  north carolina  ohio  pennsylvania  and wyoming and the regulation varies from state to state 
if future recovery of costs  in any such jurisdiction  ceases to be probable  we would be required to charge these assets to current earnings 
however  there are no current or expected proposals or changes in the regulatory environment that impact the probability of future recovery of these assets 
in addition  deregulation would be a change that occurs over time  due to legal processes and procedures  which could moderate the impact to our consolidated financial statements 
our most significant regulatory asset liability relates to the recoverable refundable costs of gas purchases 
we account for purchased gas costs in accordance with procedures authorized by the state regulatory agencies  under which purchased gas costs that are different from those provided for in present rates are accumulated and recovered or credited through future rate changes 
our gas cost recoveries are monitored closely by the regulatory commissions in all of the states in which we operate 
the gas cost recoveries are adjusted monthly in five of the seven states in which we operate  and semi annually or annually in the other two 
in addition  all of the states in which we operate require us to submit gas procurement plans  which we follow closely 
these plans are reviewed annually by each of the regulatory commissions 
the adjustment of gas cost recoveries and the gas procurement plans reduce the risk of disallowance of recoverable gas costs 
based on our experience  we believe it is highly probable that we will recover the regulatory assets that have been recorded 
we use our best judgment when recording regulatory assets and liabilities 
regulatory commissions  however  can reach different conclusions about the recovery of costs and those conclusions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents accumulated provisions for doubtful accounts we encounter risks associated with the collection of our accounts receivable 
as such  we record a provision for those accounts receivable that are considered to be uncollectible 
in order to calculate the appropriate provision  we primarily utilize current conditions as well as historical bad debt write offs as a percentage of aged receivables 
the underlying assumptions used for the provision can change from period to period and the provision could potentially cause a material impact to the accompanying financial statements by overstating liquidity and over valuing net worth 
the actual weather  commodity prices  and other internal and external economic conditions  such as the mix of the customer base between residential  commercial and industrial  may vary significantly from our assumptions and may impact our operating income 
unbilled revenue and gas costs we estimate the gas service that has been rendered from the latest date of each meter reading cycle to the month end 
this estimate of unbilled usage is based on projected base load usage for each day unbilled plus projected weather sensitive usage for each degree day during the unbilled period 
unbilled revenues and gas costs are calculated from the estimate of unbilled usage multiplied by the rates in effect at month end 
each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable  and the prior month s estimate is reversed 
likewise  the associated gas costs are recorded as cost of revenue and a payable and the prior month s estimate is reversed 
actual price and usage patterns may vary from these assumptions and may impact revenues recognized and costs recorded 
the critical component of calculating unbilled revenue is estimating the usage on a calendar month basis 
our estimated volumes used in the unbilled revenue calculation have varied from our actual monthly metered volumes by less than plus or minus on december  and december  a variance of on our gross margin from unbilled revenue at december  would have been plus or minus  fair value of financial instruments our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and bank borrowings 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the highly liquid nature of these short term instruments 
the fair values of marketable securities are estimated based on closing share price on the quoted market price for those investments 
deferred tax asset and income tax accruals judgment  uncertainty  and estimates are a significant aspect of the income tax accrual process that accounts for the effects of current and deferred income taxes 
uncertainty associated with the application of tax statutes  regulations  and income tax examinations require that judgments and estimates be made in the accrual process 
we have a deferred tax asset of approximately million as of december  related to the carryover tax basis of frontier utilities and penobscot natural gas 
the million deferred tax asset relates to acquisitions of these two subsidiaries during the carryover tax basis is subject to section of the internal revenue code 
due to limitations imposed under section  our tax depreciation is limited in tax years through we have approximately million of carryover tax basis as of december  starting in  we will recognize potential future federal and state income tax benefits of approximately million over the remaining life of the carryover tax basis of the assets 
for the federal income tax purposes  we concluded that the realization of the deferred tax asset associated with the carryover tax basis will be realized in future reporting periods based on future taxable income projections 
for state income tax purposes  we concluded that the realization of the deferred tax asset associated with the carryover tax basis will not be realized  due to state net operating loss carryovers and future state taxable income projections 
as such  management has placed a valuation allowance of approximately million on the state deferred tax assets associated with the carryover tax basis of its subsidiaries acquired during management will reevaluate the valuation allowance each year based on future taxable income projections  and will adjust the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  if based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that we will realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets 
if the projections indicate 
table of contents that we are unable to use all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets  we will adjust the valuation allowance to income tax expense benefit 
the valuation allowance is based on projections of our taxable income in future reporting years 
based on future taxable income projections  our state net operating losses will not be realized  as such  management has placed a valuation allowance of approximately million on the state deferred tax asset associated with state net operating losses 
for the federal tax portion  the five year internal revenue code limitation period discussed above expired in based on our estimates of taxable income  we project that we will recover approximately of the remaining benefit in the next nine years  with recovered in small increments in the remaining years 
based on this analysis  we believe that a valuation allowance on the federal portion of the benefit is not necessary 
failure to achieve projected levels of profitability could lead to a write down in the deferred tax asset if the recovery period becomes uncertain or longer than expected and could also lead to the expiration of the deferred tax asset between now and  either of which would adversely affect our operating results and financial position 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually  which is completed in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
lease commitments capital leases we apply the guidance of asc to determine if a lease meets the definition of a capital lease 
a lease must meet one of four criteria to meet the requirements of a capital lease 
if capital lease requirements are met  we must measure a capital lease asset and capital lease obligation initially at an amount equal to the present value at the beginning of the lease term of minimum lease payments during the lease term  excluding any executory costs 
if the present value of the minimum lease payments exceeds the fair value of the leased property at lease inception  the amount measured initially as the asset and obligation shall be the fair value

at december  and  we had approximately million and million of cash on hand  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities consists of net income adjusted for non cash items  including depreciation and amortization  accretion  deferred income taxes and changes in working capital 
our ability to maintain liquidity depends upon our credit facility with bank of america  shown as line of credit on the accompanying balance sheets 
our use of the bank of america revolving line of credit was million and million at december  and  respectively 
this increase is primarily attributable to capital expenditures in our maine and north carolina markets due to expansion 
we made capital expenditures of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we finance our capital expenditures on an interim basis by the use of our operating cash flow and use of the bank of america revolving line of credit

investing cash flow for the year ended december   cash used in investing activities decreased by million as compared to the year ended december  this is primarily due to decreased construction expenditures of million and expenditures of million in for the acquisitions of public gas and the loring pipeline  compared to million related to acquisition of the net assets of independence in august there was also an increase of million in cash restrictions for capital expenditures 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures for continuing operations totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these expenditures include million related to the acquisition of spelman in 
table of contents the majority of our capital spending is focused on the growth of our natural gas operations segment 
we conduct ongoing construction activities in all of our utility service areas in order to support expansion  maintenance  and enhancement of our gas pipeline systems 
we are actively expanding our systems in north carolina and maine to meet the high customer interest in natural gas service in those two service areas

as a result  payments on the line increased million  as we paid off the original line of credit with proceeds from the new one 
we also repaid long term debt of million with sun life  and of million with bank of america  causing long term debt proceeds to decrease by million  against the million in new long term borrowings from sun life in we agreed to deliver an irrevocable standby letter of credit to sun life in the amount of  to be drawn upon by sun life if and when any event of default has occurred and is continuing 
after discussion with sun life  the parties agreed to change the letter of credit requirement to depositing cash into a reserve account whereas sun life is the beneficiary 
in addition  sun life restricted our cash balance and required two main types of debt service reserve accounts to be created to cover approximately one year of interest payments 
the balance in both debt service reserve accounts was  and  at december  and  respectively 
for the first debt service reserve account  the reserve funds cannot be used for operating cash needs 
for the second debt service reserve account  the reserve funds can only be used for capital expenditures 
we fund our operating cash needs  as well as dividend payments and capital expenditures  primarily through cash flow from operating activities and short term borrowing 
historically  to the extent cash flow has not been sufficient to fund these expenditures  we have used our working capital line of credit 
we have greater need for short term borrowing during periods when internally generated funds are not sufficient to cover all capital and operating requirements  including costs of gas purchased and capital expenditures 
in general  our short term borrowing needs for purchases of gas inventory and capital expenditures are greatest during the summer and fall months and our short term borrowing needs for financing customer accounts receivable are greatest during the winter months

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to certain market risks  including commodity price risk ie  natural gas prices and credit risk 
the adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity nor do they consider additional actions management may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
actual results may differ 
commodity price risk we seek to protect our self against natural gas price fluctuations by limiting the aggregate level of net open positions that are exposed to market price changes 
we manage such open positions with policies that are designed to limit the exposure to market risk  with regular reporting to management of potential financial exposure 
our risk management committee has limited the types of contracts we will consider to those related to physical natural gas deliveries 
therefore  management believes that although revenues and cost of sales are impacted by changes in natural gas prices  our margin is not significantly impacted by these changes 
credit risk credit risk relates to the risk of loss that we would incur as a result of non performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations under the various instruments with us 
credit risk may be concentrated to the extent that one or more groups of counterparties have similar economic  industry or other characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in market or other conditions 
in addition  credit risk includes not only the risk that a counter party may default due to circumstances relating directly to it  but also the risk that a counterparty may default due to circumstances that relate to other market participants that have a direct or indirect relationship with such counterparty 
we seek to mitigate credit risk by evaluating the financial strength of potential counterparties 
however  despite mitigation efforts  defaults by counterparties may occur from time to time 
to date  no such default has occurred
