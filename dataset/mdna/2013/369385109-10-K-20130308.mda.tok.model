item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the following discussion  general communication  inc gci and its direct and indirect subsidiaries are referred to as we  us and our 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to the allowance for doubtful receivables  unbilled revenues  accrual of the universal service fund usf high cost remote area program support  share based compensation  inventory at lower of cost or market  reserve for future customer credits  liability for incurred but not reported medical insurance claims  valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets  depreciable and amortizable lives of assets  the carrying value of long lived assets including goodwill  cable certificates and wireless licenses  our effective tax rate  purchase price allocations  deferred lease expense  asset retirement obligations  the accrual of cost of goods sold exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense cost of goods sold  depreciation  and accrual of contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
see also our cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and supplementary data as presented in part iv of this form k 
general overview through our focus on long term results  acquisitions  and strategic capital investments  we strive to consistently grow our revenues and expand our margins 
we have historically met our cash needs for operations  regular capital expenditures and maintenance capital expenditures through our cash flows from operating activities 
historically  cash requirements for significant acquisitions and major capital expenditures have been provided largely through our financing activities 
the national economy continues to see persistent unemployment and slow economic growth and even once stabilized is not expected to return quickly to a period of strong growth 
should the national economy deteriorate further  it could lead to reductions in consumer spending which could impact our revenue growth 
as discussed earlier in item business geographic concentration and the alaska economy  we believe the alaska economy continues to perform well compared to most other states at the current time 
the state of alaska has large cash reserves that should enable it to maintain its budget for at least the short term 
this cash reserve is important for alaska s economy as the state is the largest employer and second largest source of gross state product 
the majority of our revenue is driven by the strength of the alaska economy which appears to have weathered the economic pressures relatively well to date 
nonetheless we cannot predict the impact the nation s future economic situation may have on us in the future 
on june   we entered into an asset purchase and contribution agreement wireless agreement by and among alaska communications systems group  inc acs  gci  acs wireless  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of acs acs member  gci wireless holdings  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of gci  and the alaska wireless network  llc awn  a wholly owned subsidiary of gci  pursuant to which the parties have agreed to contribute the respective wireless network assets of gci  acs and their affiliates to awn 
we entered into this agreement to provide a robust  statewide network with the spectrum mix  scale  advanced technology and cost structure necessary to compete with verizon wireless verizon and at t in alaska 
after the transaction closes awn will provide wholesale services to gci and acs 
gci and acs will use the awn network in order to continue to sell services to their respective retail customers 
gci and acs will continue to compete against each other and other wireless providers in the retail market 
under the terms of the wireless agreement  we agreed to purchase certain wireless network assets from acs and its affiliates for million and we will contribute the purchased assets  our wireless network assets and certain rights to use capacity to awn 
acs also agreed to contribute its remaining wireless network assets and certain rights to use capacity to awn 
upon the contribution of assets to awn  acs member will own one third of awn and we will own two thirds of awn 
acs member will be entitled to receive preferential cash distributions totaling million over the first four years of awn s operations and we will be entitled to all remaining cash distributions during that period 
we anticipate that the million preferential distributions to acs will constitute approximately million in distributions over the distributions otherwise attributable to their ownership percentage during such period 
following the initial four year period  we and acs member will receive distributions proportional to our ownership interests 
we are evaluating the accounting treatment for this transaction 
the closing of the transactions is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions  including the receipt of required governmental and third party consents and approvals and the expiration of any applicable waiting periods under competition laws 
the waiting period under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of has expired without any objections 
the transactions are expected to close by the second quarter of as an eligible telecommunications carrier etc  we receive support from the usf to support the provision of wireline local access and wireless services in high cost areas 
on november   the federal communications commission fcc published a final rule to reform the methodology for distributing usf high cost support for voice and broadband services  as well as to the access charge regime for terminating traffic between carriers high cost order 
the high cost order defined urban and remote areas and divided support to alaska between these two areas 
support for competitive eligible telecommunications carriers cetcs serving urban areas that generally include anchorage  fairbanks  and juneau will follow national reforms  had support per provider per service area capped as of january   and a five step phase down commenced on july  in addition to broader reforms  the fcc tailored revisions specifically for cetcs serving remote alaska  intended to address the unique challenges for serving these areas 
support to these locations will continue to be distributed on a per line basis until the later of july   or the implementation of a successor funding mechanism 
a further rulemaking to consider successor funding mechanisms is underway 
we cannot predict at this time the outcome of this proceeding or its effect on remote high cost support available to us  but our revenue for providing local access and wireless services in these areas would be materially adversely affected by a substantial reduction of usf support 
the high cost order remote and urban program changes primarily impacted our consumer segment 
the high cost order remote and urban program changes resulted in decreased consumer segment voice revenue of approximately million and decreased consumer segment wireless revenue of approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  at december   we have million and million in remote and urban high cost accounts receivable  respectively 
on february   the fcc released its report and order and further notice of proposed rulemaking to comprehensively reform and modernize the usf s lifeline program 
the lifeline program is administered by the universal service administrative company usac and is designed to ensure that quality telecommunications services are available to low income customers at affordable rates 
the order adopted several reforms but the only reform with a significant impact was a requirement for annual recertification of all lifeline subscribers enrolled as of june   to be completed by the end of subject to the waiver to perfect early recertification by january  the completion of the annual recertification process was the primary reason for our loss of approximately  lifeline subscribers from december  to december  we have recognized million in consumer wireless lifeline revenue for the year ended december  the lifeline program changes resulted in decreased consumer segment wireless revenue of approximately  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   and estimated decreased consumer segment revenue in the range of million to million for the year ending december   as compared to the year ended december  as a related matter  in april the regulatory commission of alaska rca issued a notice of inquiry to consider whether to modify the state funded component of lifeline support  which is currently per month 
in may  we responded in favor of preserving the current level of support 
we cannot predict the outcome of the support review proceedings or the impact on our income statement  financial position or cash flows 
in november  verizon acquired a license for mhz wireless spectrum covering alaska 
verizon began building a long term evolution lte network in and subsequently we expect they will be an additional competitor where our markets overlap 
we cannot predict the potential impact this new competition may have on us in the future 
as part of an agreement signed in december with at t mobility  at t mobility provided to us a large block of wireless network usage at no charge that we used for roaming 
this block of minutes was depleted in january and our wireless cost of goods sold for the year ended december   increased approximately million as compared to the year ended december   before factoring in the impact of non lifeline subscriber growth 
our future wireless cost of goods sold will depend on several factors including the impact and timing of our wireless network build out  the pattern of usage by our wireless subscribers  and negotiated rates with our roaming partners 
on october   we entered into a second arrangement under the new markets tax credit nmtc program with us bancorp for million to fund the further extension of terrestrial broadband service to rural northwestern alaska communities via a high capacity hybrid fiber optic and microwave network phase of terra northwest nmtc 
in connection with this nmtc transaction we loaned million to two special purpose entities created to effect the financing arrangement  at interest due october  simultaneously  us bancorp invested million in these special purpose entities  and as such  is entitled to substantially all of the benefits derived from the nmtcs 
the special purpose entities then contributed us bancorp s contribution and the loan proceeds to certain community development entities cdes less payment of placement fees of million 
the cdes  in turn  loaned million  at interest rates varying from to  to unicom  inc unicom  our wholly owned subsidiary  as partial financing for phase of terra northwest terra nw 
the loan proceeds to unicom  net of syndication and arrangement fees  are restricted for use on phase of terra nw 
restricted cash of million was received by unicom on october  on december   we entered into a third arrangement under the nmtc program with us bancorp for million for additional funding of phase of terra nw nmtc 
in connection with this nmtc transaction we loaned million to a special purpose entity created to effect the financing arrangement  at interest due december  simultaneously  us bancorp invested million in this special purpose entity  and as such  is entitled to substantially all of the benefits derived from the nmtcs 
the special purpose entity then contributed us bancorp s contribution and the loan proceeds to certain cdes less payment of placement fees of  the cdes  in turn  loaned million  at interest rate  to unicom as partial financing for phase of terra nw

consumer segment revenues the decrease in voice revenue is primarily due to a decrease in local service plan fee revenue to million due to decreased subscribers and a february rate decrease to one of our popular plans  a decrease in local service high cost support to million due to the changes in the high cost support program as discussed above in the general overview section of this item and a decrease in subscribers  and a decrease in long distance usage to million due to the lower rates mandated by the intrastate access reform act intrastate access reform which went into effect in july  along with our introduction of a popular new plan offering unlimited interstate and intrastate calling which went into effect in august the increase in data revenue is primarily due to an increase in cable modem revenue to million due to increased subscribers and our subscribers selection of plans that offer higher speeds  and a increase in excess usage revenue to million due to customers moving from plans with unlimited usage to plans with limited usage 
the increase in wireless revenue is primarily due to a increase in plan fee revenue to million due to our subscribers selection of plans that offer more data and an increase in non lifeline subscribers 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in wireless high cost support to million due to the changes in the high cost support program as discussed above in the general overview section of this item and decreased subscribers  and a decrease in lifeline support to million primarily due to decreased subscribers primarily resulting from the recertification program started in june and discussed above in the general overview section of this item consumer segment cost of goods sold the wireless cost of goods sold increase is primarily due to increased costs for wireless handset equipment and roaming 
our wireless handset equipment costs have increased because a higher percentage of our handsets sold have been premium smartphones which have a higher cost 
additionally  we have experienced an increase in handset sales due to an increased number of handsets issued to new customers and those extending their service 
the increase in roaming costs is due to the end of free network usage as discussed above in the general overview section of this item and an increase in data usage by our customers 
the increase in smartphones resulted in an increase in data usage

depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased million to million in primarily due to new assets placed in service in partially offset by assets which became fully depreciated during other expense  net other expense  net of other income  decreased to million in primarily due to the absence of a million loss on extinguishment of debt recognized in on may   gci  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  completed an offering of million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due notes 
we used the net proceeds from this offering to repay and retire all of our outstanding senior unsecured notes due income tax expense income tax expense totaled million and million in and  respectively 
our effective income tax rate was in and at december   we have income tax net operating loss carryforwards of million that will begin expiring in if not utilized  and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of million available to offset regular income taxes payable in future years 
we have recorded deferred tax assets of million associated with income tax net operating losses that were generated from to and that expire from to  and with charitable contributions that were converted to net operating losses in through  and that expire in through  respectively 
tax benefits associated with recorded deferred tax assets are considered to be more likely than not realizable through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
the amount of deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced which would result in additional income tax expense 
we estimate that our effective annual income tax rate for financial statement purposes will be to in the year ending december   primarily due to the large amount of permanent differences expected in as compared to our net income before income tax expense

prior to this the traffic in these regions was carried on its own network plant 
under regulatory accounting these intercompany transactions are not eliminated from the consolidated financial statements 
regulated operations segment adjusted ebitda regulated operations segment adjusted ebitda decreased to million in primarily due to a decrease in revenue  an increase in cost of goods sold as described above in regulated operations segment cost of goods sold and an increase in the selling  general and administrative expense that was recorded in our regulated operations segment 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense is primarily due to non capitalizable terra sw expenses recorded in see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv of this annual report on form k for a reconciliation of consolidated adjusted ebitda  a non gaap financial measure  to consolidated income before income taxes 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million in individually significant items contributing to the increase include a million increase in labor costs  a million increase in health benefit costs  and a million increase in bad debt expense primarily due to absence of settlements which resulted in the release of credit reserves in the third quarter of these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in our company wide success sharing bonus accrual 
the remainder of the increase is comprised of individually insignificant items 
as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were in and depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense decreased  to million in other expense  net other expense  net of other income  increased to million in primarily due to a million loss on extinguishment of debt 
on may   gci  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  completed an offering of million in aggregate principal amount of notes 
we used the net proceeds from this offering to repay and retire all of our outstanding notes 
this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in interest expense to million 
the interest expense decrease is primarily due to the issuance of the notes  which have a lower interest rate than the interest rate paid on our notes 
income tax expense income tax expense totaled million and million in and  respectively 
our effective income tax rate increased from in to in multiple system operator mso operating statistics our operating statistics include capital expenditures and customer information from our consumer and commercial segments which offer services utilizing our cable services facilities 
the standardized definition of a customer relationship is the number of customers that receive at least one level of service utilizing our cable service facilities  encompassing voice  video  and data services  without regard to which services customers purchase 
at december   and we had   and  customer relationships  respectively 
the standardized definition of a revenue generating unit is the sum of all primary digital video  high speed data  and telephony customers  not counting additional outlets 
at december   and we had   and  revenue generating units  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of current liquidity are cash and cash equivalents 
we believe  but can provide no assurances  that we will be able to meet our current and long term liquidity  capital requirements and fixed charges through our cash flows from operating activities  existing cash  cash equivalents  credit facilities  and other external financing and equity sources 
should operating cash flows be insufficient to support additional borrowings and principal payments scheduled under our existing credit facilities  capital expenditures will likely be reduced  which would likely reduce future revenues 
as discussed in the general overview section of this item  in june we entered into a wireless agreement with acs 
under the terms of the wireless agreement  we agreed to purchase certain wireless network assets from acs and its affiliates for million and we will contribute the purchased assets  our wireless network assets and certain rights to use capacity to awn 
we have also agreed to provide awn a million working capital line of credit 
we expect to finance the asset purchase and working capital line of credit by refinancing our senior credit facility 
acs member will be entitled to receive preferential cash distributions totaling million over the first four years of awn s operations and we will be entitled to all remaining cash distributions during that period 
we anticipate that the million preferential distributions to acs will constitute approximately million in excess of the distributions otherwise attributable to their ownership percentage during such period 
currently we do not expect the preference payments will result in a significant decrease in our liquidity but should the payments cause a significant decrease our non wireless capital expenditures will likely be reduced  which would likely reduce future revenues 
following the initial four year period  we and acs member will receive distributions proportional to our ownership interests 
we will manage awn and receive a management fee of of free cash flow as defined in the wireless agreement in the first two years of operations 
the management fee will increase to in the third and fourth years of the agreement and after the fourth year of the agreement 
the management fee will be paid before distributions to the owners 
in july  we received payment for the sale of a million iru 
on august   we entered into a financing arrangement under the nmtc program nmtc which provided million in net cash to help fund the extension of terrestrial broadband service for the first time to rural northwestern alaska communities via a high capacity hybrid fiber optic and microwave network 
when completed  the project  called terra nw  will connect to our terra sw network and provide a high capacity backbone connection from the served communities to the internet 
on october   and december   we entered into nmtc and nmtc  respectively  which provided million and million  respectively  in net cash to help fund additional phases of our terra nw project 
we began construction on terra nw in and expect to complete the project in or earlier if possible 
the total net cash received under nmtc  nmtc and nmtc is recorded as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets 
we have used million of restricted cash to fund terra nw capital expenditures through december  in september  the rca approved our application for a million grant to help fund terra nw 
the grant was increased to million in january we received million in grant funds during the nmtc arrangements discussed above and this grant award partially fund backbone network facilities that we would not otherwise be able to construct within our return on investment requirements 
we plan to fund an additional million for terra nw 
on october   the fcc announced our winning bids in the mobility fund i auction for a million grant to partially fund expansion of our g wireless network to high cost rural locations in alaska 
upon review we agreed to accept million 
upon fcc authorization of our final application submission  which is currently pending  we plan to begin construction in and expect to complete the project in as discussed in the general overview section of this item  in november we entered into the media agreements pursuant to which we agreed to purchase three alaska broadcast stations for a total of million 
the media agreements are subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions  including the receipt of required governmental approvals from the fcc 
the transactions are expected to close in the second half of while our short term and long term financing abilities are believed to be adequate as a supplement to internally generated cash flows to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions as opportunities arise  turmoil in the global financial markets may negatively impact our ability to further access the capital markets in a timely manner and on attractive terms  which may have a negative impact on our ability to grow our business 
we monitor the third party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents 
our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds 
our net cash flows provided by and used for operating  investing and financing activities  as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows for and  are summarized as follows amounts in thousands operating activities investing activities financing activities net decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities from to is due primarily to a decrease in accounts receivable due to timing of payments  an increase in accounts payable due to timing of payments  and a decrease in accrued interest in due to a change in due dates for semi annual interest payments on our notes as compared to the senior unsecured notes due that were retired 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities consists primarily of cash paid for capital expenditures 
our most significant recurring investing activity has been capital expenditures and we expect that this will continue in the future 
a significant portion of our capital expenditures is based on the level of customer growth and the technology being deployed 
our cash expenditures for property and equipment  including construction in progress  totaled million and million during and  respectively 
our capital expenditures decreased in primarily due to our terra sw project which was placed into service december  depending on available opportunities and the amount of cash flow we generate during  we expect our expenditures from unrestricted cash for property and equipment  including construction in progress  for our core and non core operations  to total approximately million and million  respectively 
under our terra sw rural utilities service rus award  we had total available grant funds of million 
we have received million in grant funds in for a total receipt of million in grant funds under this award through december   leaving million remaining grant funds available as of december  we have a  grant fund receivable recorded as of december  under our terra nw rca award  we had total available grant funds of million 
we have received million in grant funds in for a total receipt of million in grant funds under this award through december   leaving  remaining grant funds available as of december  we have a  grant fund receivable recorded as of december  in  we received million in restricted cash from participating in nmtc and nmtc financing transactions 
the cash is restricted for construction of terra nw 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities in consists primarily of proceeds from the issuance of our supplement no 
under our senior credit facility  borrowing under the revolving portion of our senior credit facility  borrowing under our terra sw rus loan and investments by us bancorp  a non controlling interest 
these proceeds were offset by repayments under the revolving portion of our senior credit facility  repayments of rus debt and repurchases of our common stock 
proceeds from borrowings fluctuate from year to year based on our liquidity needs 
we may use excess cash to make optional repayments on our debt or repurchase our common stock depending on various factors  such as market conditions 
available borrowings under senior credit facility we have a facility which includes an million term loan and a million revolving credit facility with a million sublimit for letters of credit senior credit facility 
the term loan is fully drawn at december  under the revolving portion of the senior credit facility we have borrowed million and have  of letters of credit outstanding  which leaves million available for borrowing as of december  a total of million is outstanding as of december  on february   we borrowed million under the revolving portion of our senior credit facility 
after consideration of this transaction  we have million available for borrowing under the revolving portion of our senior credit facility 
available terra sw borrowings under rus under our terra sw rus award  we had total available loan funds of million 
we have borrowed million in loan funds in for a total borrowing of million in loan funds under this award through december   leaving million remaining loan funds available as of december  debt covenants we are subject to covenants and restrictions applicable to our notes  our million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due  our senior credit facility  our rus loans  and our cobank loans 
we are in compliance with the covenants  and we believe that neither the covenants nor the restrictions in our indentures or loan documents will limit our ability to operate our business 
share repurchases gci s board of directors has authorized a common stock buyback program for the repurchase of gci class a and class b common stock in order to reduce the outstanding shares of class a and class b common stock 
under this program  we are currently authorized to make up to million of repurchases as of december  we are authorized to increase our repurchase limit million per quarter indefinitely and to use stock option exercise proceeds to repurchase additional shares 
if stock repurchases are less than the total approved quarterly amount the difference may be carried forward and applied against future stock repurchases 
during we repurchased million shares of gci common stock under the stock buyback program at a cost of million 
the common stock buyback program is expected to continue for an indefinite period dependent on leverage  liquidity  company performance  and market conditions and subject to continued oversight by gci s board of directors 
the open market repurchases have and will continue to comply with the restrictions of sec rule b schedule of certain known contractual obligations the following table details future projected payments associated with certain known contractual obligations as of december  amounts in thousands payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years long term debt interest on long term debt capital lease obligations  including interest operating lease commitments purchase obligations total contractual obligations long term debt listed in the table above includes principal payments on our senior credit facility  and notes  rural utilities services debt and cobank mortgage note payable 
interest on the amount outstanding under our senior credit facility is based on variable rates 
we used the current rate paid on the senior credit facility to estimate our future interest payments 
our notes require semi annual interest payments of million through november and our notes require semi annual interest payments of million through june our rural utilities services debt and cobank mortgage note payable have fixed interest rates ranging from to

capital lease obligations include our obligation to lease transponder capacity on galaxy for a discussion of our capital and operating leases  see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
purchase obligations include cancelable open purchase orders for goods and services for capital projects and normal operations totaling million which are not included in our consolidated balance sheets at december   because the goods had not been received or the services had not been performed at december  off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose and off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of our capital resources 
new accounting standards accounting standards update asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment allows an entity to assess qualitative factors such as changes in management  key personnel  strategy  key technology or customers to determine if it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired and thus whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test in accordance with gaap 
the updated guidance is effective for the quarter ending march  early adoption was permitted 
the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our income statements  financial position or cash flows 
asu  technical corrections and improvements includes amendments that cover a wide range of topics in the accounting standards codification asc 
these amendments include technical corrections and improvements to the asc and conforming amendments related to fair value measurements 
the amendments in this update will be effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  the adoption of asu is not expected to have a material impact on our income statements  financial position or cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting and reporting policies comply with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
the financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions  which are integral to understanding reported results 
critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require management to make estimates that are difficult  subjective or complex 
most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies 
several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of financial statements 
these factors include  among other things  whether the estimates are significant to the financial statements  the nature of the estimates  the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information including third parties or available prices  and sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be utilized under gaap 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
management has discussed the development and the selection of critical accounting policies with our audit committee 
those policies and estimates considered to be critical for the year ended december  are described below 
revenue recognition the accounting estimates related to revenues from the remote high cost  rural health and schools and libraries usf programs are dependent on various inputs including our estimate of the statewide support cap  our assessment of the impact of new fcc regulations  the potential outcome of fcc proceedings and the potential outcome of usac contract reviews 
some of the inputs are subjective and based on our judgment regarding the outcome of certain variables and are subject to upward or downward adjustment in subsequent periods 
significant changes to our estimates could result in material changes to the revenues we have recorded and could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful receivables we maintain allowances for doubtful receivables for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables based on notification that a customer may not have satisfactorily complied with rules necessary to obtain supplemental funding from the usac for services provided by us under our packaged communications offerings to rural hospitals  health clinics and school districts 
we base our estimates on the aging of our accounts receivable balances  financial health of specific customers  regional economic data  changes in our collections process  regulatory requirements  and our customers compliance with usac rules 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if they are unable to emerge from reorganization proceedings  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
if their financial condition improves  or they emerge successfully from reorganization proceedings  allowances may be reduced 
such allowance changes could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
impairment and useful lives of intangible assets we had million of indefinite lived intangible assets at december   consisting of cable certificates of million  goodwill of million and wireless licenses of million 
our indefinite lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the assets might be impaired 
in our annual test over goodwill we are allowed to first assess qualitative factors step zero to determine whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired 
we chose not to apply step zero and instead went straight to assessing for goodwill impairment using the traditional quantitative two step process 
the first step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be recognized in a business combination 
we chose not to early adopt asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  which would have allowed us to apply a step zero in our annual test over our indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill 
the impairment test for identifiable indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
our cable certificates are our largest indefinite lived intangible asset and represent agreements with government entities to construct and operate a video business 
the value of our cable certificates is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market new services 
the amount we have recorded for cable certificates is primarily from cable system acquisitions 
the cable certificates are valued under a direct discounted cash flow method whereby the cash flow associated with existing customers is isolated after appropriate contributory asset charges and then projected based on an analysis of customer churn and attrition characteristics 
our wireless licenses are from the fcc and give us the right to provide wireless service within a certain geographical area 
the amount we have recorded is from acquisitions of wireless companies and auctions of wireless spectrum 
we use comparable market transactions from recent fcc auctions  as appropriate  and a hypothetical build up method to value our wireless licenses 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in connection with a business acquisition 
we use an income approach to determine the fair value of our reporting units for purposes of our goodwill impairment test 
in addition  a market based approach is used where possible to corroborate the fair values determined by the income approach 
the direct discounted cash flow  hypothetical build up  and income approach valuation methods require us to make estimates and assumptions including projected cash flows  discount rate  customer churn  and customer behaviors and attrition 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such impairment charge 
fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time  based on relevant information 
these estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision 
changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates 
events and factors that may be out of our control that could affect the estimates include such things as competitive forces  customer behaviors  change in revenue growth trends  cost structures and technology  and changes in discount rates  performance compared to peers  material and ongoing negative economic trends  and specific industry or market sector conditions 
our company is operated and managed with two balance sheets  however  our impairment tests must be performed at the reporting unit level  which requires us to allocate one of our balance sheets 
these allocations are subjective and require a significant amount of judgment 
changes to the assumptions and allocation methodologies could significantly change our estimates 
we may also record impairments in the future if there are changes in long term market conditions  expected future operating results  or laws and regulations that may prevent us from recovering the carrying value of our goodwill  cable certificates  and wireless licenses 
we have allocated all of the goodwill to our reporting units and based on our annual impairment test as of october   the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the book value by a range between and 
the reporting unit that exceeded the book value by passed the goodwill impairment test by million  which we believe is a large margin 
we believe none of our reporting units were close to failing step one of the goodwill impairment test 
based on our annual impairment test as of october   the fair value of our cable certificates exceeded the book value by and million  which we believe is a large margin 
the fair value of our wireless licenses exceeded the book value by and million as of october  the fair value of our wireless licenses was negatively affected by increases in our forecasted wireless cost of goods sold for handset and data roaming costs 
valuation allowance for net operating loss deferred tax assets our income tax policy provides for deferred income taxes to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
we have recorded deferred tax assets of million associated with income tax net operating losses that were generated from to  and that primarily expire from to  and with charitable contributions that were converted to net operating losses in to  and that expire in to  respectively 
we have recorded deferred tax assets of million associated with alternative minimum tax credits that do not expire 
significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that may be required against the deferred tax assets 
we have not recorded a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets as of december   based on management s belief that future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and estimated future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards will  more likely than not  be sufficient to realize the benefit of these assets over time 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or if our historical trends change  we may be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
other significant accounting policies  not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
regulatory developments see part i item business regulation for more information about regulatory developments affecting us 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has a significant effect on our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business  including the impact of interest rate changes 
our senior credit facility carries interest rate risk 
amounts borrowed under our senior credit facility bear interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus or less depending upon our total leverage ratio as defined in the senior credit facility for the revolving portion and libor plus for the term portion 
should the libor rate change  our interest expense will increase or decrease accordingly 
as of december   we have borrowed million subject to interest rate risk 
on this amount  each increase in the libor interest rate would result in  of additional gross interest cost on an annualized basis 
all of our other material borrowings have a fixed interest rate 
we do not hold derivatives
