recent developments superstorm sandy in late october   superstorm sandy made landfall in the northeastern united states 
while we are still evaluating the ultimate impact of this event  our current estimate of ultimate loss is approximately million 
actual losses from this event may vary materially from our current estimates due to the inherent uncertainties resulting from several factors  including the preliminary nature of the loss data available and potential inaccuracies and inadequacies in the data provided

hennessy resigned from the company s board of directors 
share repurchase program on august   the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to million of its a ordinary shares 
the company repurchased and retired an aggregate  of its a ordinary shares in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions at an aggregate price of million or an average of per share 
the company does not have authorization from the board of directors to repurchase any additional a ordinary shares as of december  the excess cost of the repurchased shares over their par value was classified to additional paid in capital as of december  overview the company s insurance operations distribute property and casualty insurance products through a group of approximately professional general agencies that have limited quoting and binding authority  as well as a number of wholesale insurance brokers who in turn sell the company s insurance products to insureds through retail insurance brokers 
the company operates predominantly in the excess and surplus lines marketplace 
to manage its operations  the company differentiates them by product classification 
these product classifications are penn america  which includes property and general liability products for small commercial businesses distributed through a select network of wholesale general agents with specific binding authority  united national  which includes property  general liability  and professional lines products distributed through program administrators with specific binding authority  and diamond state  which includes property  casualty  and professional lines products distributed through wholesale brokers and program administrators with specific binding authority 
the company s reinsurance operations segment provides reinsurance solutions through brokers  program managers and primary writers  including regional insurance companies  and consists solely of the operations of 
table of contents wind river reinsurance 
wind river reinsurance is a bermuda based treaty reinsurer of excess and surplus lines carriers  specialty property and casualty insurance companies and us regional insurance writers 
wind river reinsurance conducts business in bermuda and is focused on using its capital capacity to write catastrophe oriented placements and other niche or specialty focused treaties meeting the company s risk tolerance and return thresholds 
given the current pricing environment  wind river reinsurance continues to cautiously deploy and manage its capital while seeking to position itself as a niche reinsurance solution provider 
the company derives its revenues primarily from premiums paid on insurance policies that it writes and from income generated by its investment portfolio  net of fees paid for investment management services 
the amount of insurance premiums that the company receives is a function of the amount and type of policies it writes  as well as of prevailing market prices 
the company s expenses include losses and loss adjustment expenses  acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses  corporate and other operating expenses  interest  investment expenses  and income taxes 
losses and loss adjustment expenses are estimated by management and reflect the company s best estimate of ultimate losses and costs arising during the reporting period and revisions of prior period estimates 
the company records losses and loss adjustment expenses based on an actuarial analysis of the estimated losses the company expects to incur on the insurance policies it writes 
the ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses will depend on the actual costs to resolve claims 
acquisition costs consist principally of commissions and premium taxes that are typically a percentage of the premiums on the insurance policies the company writes  net of ceding commissions earned from reinsurers 
other underwriting expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses and general operating expenses 
corporate and other operating expenses are comprised primarily of outside legal fees  other professional and accounting fees  directors fees  management fees  salaries and benefits for company personnel whose services relate to the support of corporate activities  and capital duty taxes incurred 
interest expense consists primarily of interest on senior notes payable  junior subordinated debentures  and funds held on behalf of others 
critical accounting estimates and policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with united states of america generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which requires it to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of part ii of this report 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
effective january   the company adopted new accounting guidance that modified the definition of costs that can be capitalized in the acquisition of new and renewal business for insurance companies 
under the new guidance  only direct incremental costs associated with successful insurance contract acquisitions or renewals are deferrable 
this guidance was adopted retrospectively and has been applied to all prior period information contained in this form k 
for further information please see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report 
the company believes that of the company s significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and estimation 
liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses although variability is inherent in estimates  the company believes that the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses reflects its best estimate for future amounts needed to pay losses and related loss adjustment expenses and the impact of its reinsurance coverage with respect to insured events 

table of contents in developing loss and loss adjustment expense loss or losses reserve estimates for the company s insurance operations  its actuaries perform detailed reserve analyses each quarter 
to perform the analysis  the data is organized at a reserve category level 
a reserve category can be a line of business such as commercial automobile liability  or it can be a particular type of claim such as construction defect 
the reserves within a reserve category level are characterized as short tail through long tail 
for long tail business  it will generally be several years between the time the business is written and the time when all claims are settled 
the company s long tail exposures include general liability  professional liability  products liability  commercial automobile liability  and excess and umbrella 
short tail exposures include property  commercial automobile physical damage  and equine mortality 
to manage its insurance operations  the company differentiates them by product classifications  which are penn america  united national  and diamond state 
for further discussion about the company s product classifications  see general business segments insurance operations in item of part i of this report 
each of the company s product classifications contain both long tail and short tail exposures 
every reserve category is analyzed by the company s actuaries each quarter 
the analyses generally include reviews of losses gross of reinsurance and net of reinsurance 
loss reserve estimates for the company s reinsurance operations are developed by independent  external actuaries  however management is responsible for the final determination of loss reserve selections 
the data for this analysis is organized by treaty and treaty year 
as with the company s reserves for its insurance operations  reserves for its reinsurance operations are characterized as short tail through long tail 
long tail exposures include workers compensation  professional liability  and excess and umbrella liability 
short tail exposures are primarily catastrophe exposed property accounts 
every treaty is reviewed each quarter  both gross and net of reinsurance 
in addition to the company s internal reserve analysis  independent external actuaries perform a full  detailed review of the insurance operations reserves annually 
the company does not rely upon the review by the independent actuaries to develop its reserves  however  the data is used to corroborate the analysis performed by the in house actuarial staff 
the company s independent external actuaries also perform a full  detailed review of the reinsurance operations reserves annually 
the methods used to project ultimate losses for both long tail and short tail exposures include  but are not limited to  the following paid development method  incurred development method  expected loss ratio method  bornhuetter ferguson method using premiums and paid loss  bornhuetter ferguson method using premiums and incurred loss  and average loss method 
the paid development method estimates ultimate losses by reviewing paid loss patterns and applying them to accident years with further expected changes in paid loss 
selection of the paid loss pattern requires analysis of several factors including the impact of inflation on claims costs  the rate at which claims professionals make claim payments and close claims  the impact of judicial decisions  the impact of underwriting changes  the impact of large claim payments and other factors 
claim cost inflation itself requires evaluation of changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property  changes in the cost of medical care  changes in the cost of wage replacement  judicial decisions  legislative changes and other factors 
because this method assumes that losses are paid at a consistent rate  changes in any of these factors can impact the results 
since the method does not rely on case reserves  it is not directly influenced by changes in the adequacy of case reserves 
for many reserve categories  paid loss data for recent periods may be too immature or erratic for accurate predictions 
this situation often exists for long tail exposures 
in addition  changes in the factors described above 
table of contents may result in inconsistent payment patterns 
finally  estimating the paid loss pattern subsequent to the most mature point available in the data analyzed often involves considerable uncertainty for long tail reserve categories 
the incurred development method is similar to the paid development method  but it uses case incurred losses instead of paid losses 
since this method uses more data case reserves in addition to paid losses than the paid development method  the incurred development patterns may be less variable than paid development patterns 
however  selection of the incurred loss pattern requires analysis of all of the factors listed in the description of the paid development method 
in addition  the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in case reserving practices have taken place and the use of case incurred losses may not eliminate the issues associated with estimating the incurred loss pattern subsequent to the most mature point available 
the expected loss ratio method multiplies premiums by an expected loss ratio to produce ultimate loss estimates for each accident year 
this method may be useful if loss development patterns are inconsistent  losses emerge very slowly  or there is relatively little loss history from which to estimate future losses 
the selection of the expected loss ratio requires analysis of loss ratios from earlier accident years or pricing studies and analysis of inflationary trends  frequency trends  rate changes  underwriting changes  and other applicable factors 
the bornhuetter ferguson method using premiums and paid losses is a combination of the paid development method and the expected loss ratio method 
this method normally determines expected loss ratios similar to the method used for the expected loss ratio method and requires analysis of the same factors described above 
the method assumes that only future losses will develop at the expected loss ratio level 
the percent of paid loss to ultimate loss implied from the paid development method is used to determine what percentage of ultimate loss is yet to be paid 
the use of the pattern from the paid development method requires consideration of all factors listed in the description of the paid development method 
the estimate of losses yet to be paid is added to current paid losses to estimate the ultimate loss for each year 
this method will react very slowly if actual ultimate loss ratios are different from expectations due to changes not accounted for by the expected loss ratio calculation 
the bornhuetter ferguson method using premiums and incurred losses is similar to the bornhuetter ferguson method using premiums and paid losses except that it uses case incurred losses 
the use of case incurred losses instead of paid losses can result in development patterns that are less variable than paid development patterns 
however  the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in case reserving practices have taken place 
the method requires analysis of all the factors that need to be reviewed for the expected loss ratio and incurred development methods 
the average loss method multiplies a projected number of ultimate claims by an estimated ultimate average loss for each accident year to produce ultimate loss estimates 
since projections of the ultimate number of claims are often less variable than projections of ultimate loss  this method can provide more reliable results for reserve categories where loss development patterns are inconsistent or too variable to be relied on exclusively 
in addition  this method can more directly account for changes in coverage that impact the number and size of claims 
however  this method can be difficult to apply to situations where very large claims or a substantial number of unusual claims result in volatile average claim sizes 
projecting the ultimate number of claims requires analysis of several factors including the rate at which policyholders report claims to the company  the impact of judicial decisions  the impact of underwriting changes and other factors 
estimating the ultimate average loss requires analysis of the impact of large losses and claim cost trends based on changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property  changes in the cost of medical care  changes in the cost of wage replacement  judicial decisions  legislative changes and other factors 
for many exposures  especially those that can be considered long tail  a particular accident year may not have a sufficient volume of paid losses to produce a statistically reliable estimate of ultimate losses 
in such a case  the company s actuaries typically assign more weight to the incurred development method than to the paid 
table of contents development method 
as claims continue to settle and the volume of paid losses increases  the actuaries may assign additional weight to the paid development method 
for most of the company s reserve categories  even the incurred losses for accident years that are early in the claim settlement process will not be of sufficient volume to produce a reliable estimate of ultimate losses 
in these cases  the company will not assign any weight to the paid and incurred development methods and will use the bornhuetter ferguson and expected loss ratio methods 
for short tail exposures  the paid and incurred development methods can often be relied on sooner primarily because the company s history includes a sufficient number of years to cover the entire period over which paid and incurred losses are expected to change 
however  the company may also use the expected loss ratio  bornhuetter ferguson and average loss methods for short tail exposures 
generally  reserves for long tail lines use the expected loss ratio method for the most recent accident year  shift to the bornhuetter ferguson methods for the next two years  and then shift to the incurred and or paid development method 
claims related to umbrella business are usually reported later than claims for other long tail lines 
for umbrella business  the expected loss ratio and bornhuetter ferguson methods are used for as many as six years before shifting to the incurred development method 
reserves for short tail lines use the bornhuetter ferguson methods for the most recent accident year and shift to the incurred and or paid development method in subsequent years 
for other more complex reserve categories where the above methods may not produce reliable indications  the company uses additional methods tailored to the characteristics of the specific situation 
such reserve categories include losses from construction defects and a e 
for construction defect losses  the company s actuaries organize losses by the year in which they were reported 
to estimate losses from claims that have not been reported  various extrapolation techniques are applied to the pattern of claims that have been reported to estimate the number of claims yet to be reported 
this process requires analysis of several factors including the rate at which policyholders report claims to the company  the impact of judicial decisions  the impact of underwriting changes and other factors 
an average claim size is determined from past experience and applied to the number of unreported claims to estimate reserves for these claims 
establishing reserves for a e and other mass tort claims involves considerably more judgment than other types of claims due to  among other things  inconsistent court decisions  an increase in bankruptcy filings as a result of asbestos related liabilities  and judicial interpretations that often expand theories of recovery and broaden the scope of coverage 
the insurance industry continues to receive a substantial number of asbestos related bodily injury claims  with an increasing focus being directed toward other parties  including installers of products containing asbestos rather than against asbestos manufacturers 
this shift has resulted in significant insurance coverage litigation implicating applicable coverage defenses or determinations  if any  including but not limited to  determinations as to whether or not an asbestos related bodily injury claim is subject to aggregate limits of liability found in most comprehensive general liability policies 
in response to these continuing developments  management increased gross and net a e reserves during to reflect its best estimate of a e exposures 
in  one of the company s insurance companies was dismissed from a lawsuit seeking coverage from it and other unrelated insurance companies 
the suit involved issues related to approximately  existing asbestos related bodily injury claims and future claims 
the dismissal was the result of a settlement of a disputed claim related to accident year the settlement is conditioned upon certain legal events occurring which may trigger financial obligations by the insurance company 
on october   the united states district court for the northern district of california district court issued an order confirming an amended plan of reorganization plan for a named insured that included an injunction under usc section g us bankruptcy code related to the suit above 
the injunction  also called a channeling injunction  precludes  inter alia  non settling insurers from asserting claims against one of the company s insurance companies and asbestos related claims by third parties against one of the company s insurance companies that are related to the named insured 
an appeal from the district court order has been filed 
table of contents with the th circuit court of appeals 
a motion for stay to prevent the plan and the channeling injunction from taking effect has been denied by the district court 
management will continue to monitor the developments of the litigation to determine if any additional financial exposure is present 
reserve analyses performed by the company s internal and external actuaries result in actuarial point estimates 
the results of the detailed reserve reviews were summarized and discussed with the company s senior management to determine the best estimate of reserves 
this group considered many factors in making this decision 
the factors included  but were not limited to  the historical pattern and volatility of the actuarial indications  the sensitivity of the actuarial indications to changes in paid and incurred loss patterns  the consistency of claims handling processes  the consistency of case reserving practices  changes in the company s pricing and underwriting  and overall pricing and underwriting trends in the insurance market 
management s best estimate at december  was recorded as the loss reserve 
management s best estimate is as of a particular point in time and is based upon known facts  the company s actuarial analyses  current law  and the company s judgment 
this resulted in carried gross and net reserves of million and million  respectively  as of december  a breakout of the company s gross and net reserves  excluding the effects of the company s intercompany pooling arrangements and intercompany stop loss and quota share reinsurance agreements  as of december  is as follows gross reserves dollars in thousands case ibnr total insurance operations reinsurance operations total net reserves dollars in thousands case ibnr total insurance operations reinsurance operations total losses incurred but not reported  including the expected future emergence of case reserves 
does not include reinsurance receivable on paid losses 
the company continually reviews these estimates and  based on new developments and information  includes adjustments of the estimated ultimate liability in the operating results for the periods in which the adjustments are made 
the establishment of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves makes no provision for the possible broadening of coverage by legislative action or judicial interpretation  or the emergence of new types of losses not sufficiently represented in the company s historical experience or that cannot yet be quantified or estimated 
the company regularly analyzes its reserves and reviews pricing and reserving methodologies so that future adjustments to prior year reserves can be minimized 
however  given the complexity of this process  reserves require continual updates and the ultimate liability may be higher or lower than previously indicated 
changes in estimates for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are recorded in the period that the change in these estimates is made 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for details concerning the changes in the estimate for incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses related to prior accident years 
the detailed reserve analyses that the company s internal and external actuaries complete use a variety of generally accepted actuarial methods and techniques to produce a number of estimates of ultimate loss 
the company determines its best estimate of ultimate loss by reviewing the various estimates and assigning weight to each estimate given the characteristics of the reserve category being reviewed 
the reserve estimate is the 
table of contents difference between the estimated ultimate loss and the losses paid to date 
the difference between the estimated ultimate loss and the case incurred loss paid loss plus case reserve is considered to be ibnr 
ibnr calculated as such includes a provision for development on known cases supplemental development as well as a provision for claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported pure ibnr 
in light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the assumptions necessary to establish reserve levels  the company reviews its reserve estimates on a regular basis and makes adjustments in the period that the need for such adjustments is determined 
the anticipated future loss emergence continues to be reflective of historical patterns  and the selected development patterns have not changed significantly from those underlying the company s most recent analyses 
the key assumptions fundamental to the reserving process are often different for various reserve categories and accident years 
some of these assumptions are explicit assumptions that are required of a particular method  but most of the assumptions are implicit and cannot be precisely quantified 
an example of an explicit assumption is the pattern employed in the paid development method 
however  the assumed pattern is itself based on several implicit assumptions such as the impact of inflation on medical costs and the rate at which claim professionals close claims 
loss frequency is a measure of the number of claims per unit of insured exposure  and loss severity is a measure of the average size of claims 
each reserve segment has an implicit frequency and severity for each accident year as a result of the various assumptions made 
previous reserve analyses have resulted in the company s identification of information and trends that have caused it to increase or decrease frequency and severity assumptions in prior periods and could lead to the identification of a need for additional material changes in loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  which could materially affect results of operations  equity  business and insurer financial strength and debt ratings 
factors affecting loss frequency include  among other things  the effectiveness of loss controls and safety programs and changes in economic activity or weather patterns 
factors affecting loss severity include  among other things  changes in policy limits and deductibles  rate of inflation and judicial interpretations 
another factor affecting estimates of loss frequency and severity is the loss reporting lag  which is the period of time between the occurrence of a loss and the date the loss is reported to the company 
the length of the loss reporting lag affects the company s ability to accurately predict loss frequency loss frequencies are more predictable for short tail lines as well as the amount of reserves needed for ibnr 
if the actual levels of loss frequency and severity are higher or lower than expected  the ultimate losses will be different than management s best estimate 
for most of its reserving classes  the company believes that frequency can be predicted with greater accuracy than severity 
therefore  the company believes management s best estimate is more sensitive to changes in severity than frequency 
the following table  which the company believes reflects a reasonable range of variability around its best estimate based on historical loss experience and management s judgment  reflects the impact of changes which could be favorable or unfavorable in frequency and severity on the company s current accident year net loss estimate of million for claims occurring during the year ended december  dollars in thousands severity change frequency change 
table of contents the company s net reserves for losses and loss expenses of million as of december  relate to multiple accident years 
therefore  the impact of changes in frequency and severity for more than one accident year could be higher or lower than the amounts reflected above 
recoverability of reinsurance receivables the company regularly reviews the collectability of its reinsurance receivables  and includes adjustments resulting from this review in earnings in the period in which the adjustment arises 
am best ratings  financial history  available collateral  and payment history with the reinsurers are several of the factors that the company considers when judging collectability 
changes in loss reserves can also affect the valuation of reinsurance receivables if the change is related to loss reserves that are ceded to reinsurers 
certain amounts may be uncollectible if the company s reinsurers dispute a loss or if the reinsurer is unable to pay 
if its reinsurers do not pay  the company is still legally obligated to pay the loss 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for further information surrounding the company s reinsurance receivable balances and collectability as of december  and for a listing of the ten reinsurers for which the company has the largest reinsurance asset amounts as of december   see reinsurance of underwriting risk in item of part i of this report 
investments the carrying amount of the company s investments approximates their estimated fair value 
the company regularly performs various analytical valuation procedures with respect to investments  including reviewing each fixed maturity security in an unrealized loss position to determine the amount of unrealized loss related to credit loss and the amount related to all other factors  such as changes in interest rates 
the credit loss represents the portion of the amortized book value in excess of the net present value of the projected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate implicit in the debt security prior to impairment 
the credit loss component of the other than temporary impairment is recorded through earnings  whereas the amount relating to factors other than credit losses are recorded in other comprehensive income  net of taxes 
during its review  the company considers credit rating  market price  and issuer specific financial information  among other factors  to assess the likelihood of collection of all principal and interest as contractually due 
securities for which the company determines that a credit loss is likely are subjected to further analysis to estimate the credit loss to be recognized in earnings  if any 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for the specific methodologies and significant assumptions used by asset class 
upon identification of such securities and periodically thereafter  a detailed review is performed to determine whether the decline is considered other than temporary 
this review includes an analysis of several factors  including but not limited to  the credit ratings and cash flows of the securities  and the magnitude and length of time that the fair value of such securities is below cost 
for an analysis of the company s securities with gross unrealized losses as of december  and  and for other than temporary impairment losses that the company recorded for the years ended december    and  please see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report 
fair value measurements the company categorizes its assets that are accounted for at fair value in the consolidated statements into a fair value hierarchy 
the fair value hierarchy is directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs utilized to determine the fair value of these assets 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for further information about the fair value hierarchy and the company s assets that are accounted for at fair value 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets the company tests for impairment of goodwill at least annually and more frequently as circumstances warrant in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 
recent accounting guidance allows for the testing of goodwill for impairment using both qualitative and quantitative factors 
impairment of goodwill is recognized only if the carrying amount of the business unit  including goodwill  exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit 
the amount of the impairment loss would be equal to the excess carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
based on the analysis performed in  there was no impairment of goodwill as of december  the company tests for impairment of intangible assets with an indefinite useful life at least annually and more frequently as circumstances warrant in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 
recent accounting guidance allows for the testing of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment using both qualitative and quantitative factors 
impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets is recognized only if the carrying amount of the intangible assets exceeds the fair value of said assets 
the amount of the impairment loss would be equal to the excess carrying value of the assets over the fair value of said assets 
based on the analysis performed in  there were no impairments of indefinite lived intangible assets as of december  intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite useful life are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the carrying amounts of definite lived intangible assets are regularly reviewed for indicators of impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 
impairment is recognized only if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is in excess of its undiscounted projected cash flows 
the impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the asset 
based on the analysis performed in  there were no impairments of definite lived intangible assets as of december  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for more details concerning the company s goodwill and intangible assets 
deferred acquisition costs the costs of acquiring new and renewal insurance and reinsurance contracts include commissions  premium taxes and certain other costs that vary with and are directly related to the successful acquisition of new and renewal insurance and reinsurance contracts 
the excess of the company s costs of acquiring new and renewal insurance and reinsurance contracts over the related ceding commissions earned from reinsurers is capitalized as deferred acquisition costs and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
in accordance with accounting guidance for insurance enterprises  the method followed in computing such amounts limits them to their estimated realizable value that gives effect to the premium to be earned  related investment income  losses and loss adjustment expenses  and certain other costs expected to be incurred as the premium is earned 
a premium deficiency is recognized if the sum of expected loss and loss adjustment expenses and unamortized acquisition costs exceeds related unearned premium 
any future expected loss on the related unearned premium is recorded first by impairing the unamortized acquisition costs on the related unearned premium followed by an increase to loss and loss adjustment expense reserves on additional expected loss in excess of unamortized acquisition costs 
effective january   the company adopted new accounting guidance that modified the definition of costs that can be capitalized in the acquisition of new and renewal business for insurance companies 
under the new guidance  only direct incremental costs associated with successful insurance contract acquisitions or renewals are deferrable 
this guidance was adopted retrospectively and has been applied to all prior period information contained in this form k 
for further information please see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report 

table of contents as of december   the company s deferred acquisition costs were million lower than they would have been due to premium deficiencies 
as of december   the company s deferred acquisition costs were million lower than they would have been and loss and loss adjustment expense reserves were million higher than they would have been due to premium deficiencies 
taxation the company provides for income taxes in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 
the company s deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily result from temporary differences between the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements and the tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities 
at each balance sheet date  management assesses the need to establish a valuation allowance that reduces deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all  or some portion  of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
a valuation allowance would be based on all available information including the company s assessment of uncertain tax positions and projections of future taxable income from each tax paying component in each jurisdiction  principally derived from business plans and available tax planning strategies 
there are no valuation allowances as of december  the deferred tax asset balance is analyzed regularly by management 
based on these analyses  the company has determined that its deferred tax asset is recoverable 
projections of future taxable income incorporate several assumptions of future business and operations that are apt to differ from actual experience 
if  in the future  the company s assumptions and estimates that resulted in the forecast of future taxable income for each tax paying component prove to be incorrect  a valuation allowance may be required 
this could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
the company applies a more likely than not recognition threshold for all tax uncertainties  only allowing the recognition of those tax benefits that have a greater than likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities 
please see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for a discussion of the company s tax uncertainties

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of economic losses due to adverse changes in the estimated fair value of a financial instrument as the result of changes in interest rates  equity prices  credit risk  illiquidity  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
the company s consolidated balance sheet includes the estimated fair values of assets that are subject to market risk 
the company s primary market risks are interest rate risk and credit risks associated with investments in fixed maturities  equity price risk associated with investments in equity securities  and foreign exchange risk associated with premium received that is denominated in foreign currencies 
each of these risks is discussed in more detail below 
the company has no commodity risk 
interest rate risk the company s primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates 
the company s fixed income investments are exposed to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these securities 
as interest rates rise  the market value of the company s fixed income investments fall  and the converse is also true 
the company seeks to manage interest rate risk through an active portfolio management strategy that involves the selection  by the company s managers  of investments with appropriate characteristics  such as duration  yield  currency  and liquidity that are tailored to the anticipated cash outflow characteristics of the company s liabilities 
the company s strategy for managing interest rate risk also includes maintaining a high quality bond portfolio with a relatively short duration to reduce the effect of interest rate changes on book value 
a significant portion of the company s investment portfolio matures each year  allowing for reinvestment at current market rates 
as of december   assuming identical shifts in interest rates for securities of all maturities  the table below illustrates the sensitivity of market value in global indemnity s bonds to selected hypothetical changes in basis point increases and decreases dollars in thousands change in market value basis point change market value no change credit risk the company has exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed income investments as well as corporate loans 
with the exception of corporate loans  the company s investment policy requires that it invests in debt instruments of high credit quality issuers and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer based upon the rating of the security 
the company s corporate loan portfolio is subject to default risk since these investments are typically below investment grade 
to mitigate this risk  the company s investment managers perform an in depth structural analysis 
as part of this analysis  they focus on the strength of any security granted to the lenders  the position of the loan in the company s capital structure and the appropriate covenant protection 
in addition  as part of the company s risk control  its investment managers maintain appropriate portfolio diversification by limiting issuer and industry exposure 

table of contents as of december   the company had approximately million worth of investment exposure to subprime and alt a investments 
as of december   approximately million of those investments have been rated bbb to aaa by standard poor s and million were rated below investment grade 
as of december   the company had approximately million worth of investment exposure to subprime and alt a investments 
as of december   approximately million of those investments have been rated bbb to aaa by standard poor s and million were rated below investment grade 
there was an impairment of million recognized on these investments during the year ended december  there were no impairments recognized on these investments during the year ended december  in addition  the company has credit risk exposure to its general agencies and reinsurers 
the company seeks to mitigate and control its risks to producers by typically requiring its general agencies to render payments within no more than days after the month in which a policy is effective and including provisions within the company s general agency contracts that allow it to terminate a general agency s authority in the event of non payment 
with respect to its credit exposure to reinsurers  the company seeks to mitigate and control its risk by ceding business to only those reinsurers having adequate financial strength and sufficient capital to fund their obligation 
in addition  the company seeks to mitigate credit risk to reinsurers through the use of trusts and letters of credit for collateral 
equity price risk in  the strategy for the company s equity portfolio followed a large cap value approach 
this investment style will place primary emphasis on selecting the best relative values from those issues having a projected normalized price earnings ratio at a discount to the market multiple 
the company compares the results of the company s equity portfolio to a customized benchmark 
effective july   the custom benchmark is the s p value excluding financials 
prior to july   the custom benchmark was the s p citigroup excluding p c insurers  multi line insurers and investment banks brokers index 
to protect against equity price risk  the sector exposures within the company s equity portfolio closely correlate to the sector exposures within the custom benchmark index 
in  the company s common stock portfolio had a return of  not including investment advisor fees  compared to the benchmark return of 
the carrying values of investments subject to equity price risk are based on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet dates 
market prices are subject to fluctuation and thus the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may differ from the reported market value 
fluctuation in the market price of an equity security results from perceived changes in the underlying economic makeup of a stock  the price of alternative investments and overall market conditions 
the company attempts to mitigate its unsystematic risk  which is the risk that is associated with holding a particular security  by holding a large number of securities in that market 
at year end  no security represented more than of the market value of the equity portfolio 
the company continues to have systematic risk  which is the risk inherent in the general market due to broad macroeconomic factors that affect all companies in the market 

table of contents as of december   the table below summarizes the company s equity price risk and reflects the effect of a hypothetical and increase or decrease in market prices 
the selected hypothetical changes do not indicate what could be the potential best or worst scenarios 
dollars in thousands hypothetical price change estimated fair value after hypothetical change in prices hypothetical percentage increase decrease in shareholders equity no change net of tax foreign currency exchange risk the company has foreign currency exchange risk associated with a portion of the business written at wind river reinsurance  as well as a small portion of expenses related to corporate overhead in its ireland office 
the company also maintains investments in foreign denominated securities and cash accounts in foreign currencies in order to pay expenses in foreign countries 
at period end  the company re measures those non us currency financial assets to their current non us dollar equivalent 
financial liabilities  if any  are generally adjusted within the reserving process 
however  for known losses on claims to be paid in foreign currencies  the company re measures the liabilities to their current us dollar equivalent each period end
