item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading global provider of commercial high resolution earth imagery products and services 
our products and services support a wide variety of uses  including defense  intelligence and homeland security applications  mapping and analysis  environmental monitoring  oil and gas exploration  and infrastructure management 
our principal customers are governments  including us and foreign defense and intelligence  and civil agencies and providers of lbs 
additionally we serve a wide variety of companies in other industry verticals  such as the financial services  energy  telecommunications  utility  forestry  mining  environmental and agricultural industries 
the imagery that forms the foundation of our products and services is collected daily via our high resolution imaging satellites and managed in our imagery archive  which we refer to as our imagelibrary 
as of december   we had three high resolution satellites in orbit  and following the merger with geoeye on january   we have five high resolution satellites in orbit 
as of december   our imagelibrary contained more than billion square kilometers of imagery 
as of december   our collection capacity was approximately billion square kilometers of imagery per year or roughly seven times the earth s land surface area and offers intraday revisit around the globe 
net revenue increased for the year ended december  as compared with in order to continue our net revenue growth  we provide customers with superior performance and service by increasing the capacity of our constellation with the activation of additional ground terminals and expect to add a new satellite  worldview  which is currently under construction and expected to be ready for launch in the second half of we continue to add dap customers  with our sixth such customer expected to begin contributing to net revenue in the second half of despite increasing competition from both commercial and state owned satellites  we anticipate increased demand for our imagery and analysis services used by commercial and civil government customers for mapping applications  information services  and land and environmental management 
on january   we completed our acquisition of of the outstanding stock of geoeye 
in connection with the acquisition  geoeye common stockholders received  in the aggregate  approximately million shares of digitalglobe common stock and approximately million in cash 
in addition  each share of geoeye series a convertible preferred stock was converted into a newly designated series a 
table of contents convertible preferred stock of digitalglobe  and cash consideration of approximately million was paid to the holders of the geoeye series a convertible preferred 
we also assumed unvested awards under geoeye s equity incentive plans 
the geoeye acquisition has increased our revenue and asset scale  as well as diversified our customer base 
by optimizing orbits  coordinating scheduling and optimizing collection of imagery  we expect to increase imaging capacity and improve timelines and revisit rates 
we expect to reduce capital expenditures as a result of having five operational satellites  of which we intend to only maintain a constellation of three satellites over the longer term 
additionally  the combined company has two satellites near end of construction 
we currently expect to launch worldview in the second half of we anticipate that operating expense synergies will be realized primarily within the six quarters following the close of the combination 
we expect cost savings and efficiencies to come from actions we will take principally with respect to labor cost reductions and infrastructure savings 
we anticipate that we will recognize restructuring and combination related expenses of approximately million during to achieve these future savings and efficiencies

for the year ended december   we conducted our business through two segments i defense and intelligence  and ii commercial 
we organized our business into these two segments because we believe that customers in these two groups are functionally similar in terms of their areas of focus and purchasing habits 
in connection with our business combination with geoeye  we are evaluating our future business segments 
our imagery products and services are comprised of imagery that we process to varying levels according to the customer s specifications 
we deliver our products and services using the distribution method suited to our customers needs 
customers can purchase satellite or aerial images that are archived in our imagelibrary 
customers can also order imagery content by placing custom orders  which requires tasking of our satellites  for a specific area of interest  or as a bundle of imagery and data for a region or type of location  such as cities  ports  harbors or airports 
net revenue by segment defense and intelligence net revenue our defense and intelligence segment consists of customers who are principally defense and intelligence agencies of us or foreign governments 
the us government  through nga  purchases our imagery products and services on behalf of various entities within the us government  including the military commands and other government agencies 
we also sell to other us defense and intelligence customers including defense and intelligence contractors who provide an additional outlet for our imagery by providing value added services with our imagery to deliver a final end product to a customer 
our defense and intelligence customers focus on image quality  including resolution  frequency of area revisit and coverage  as well as ensuring availability of a certain amount of our capacity as they integrate our products and services into their operational planning 
our customers in this segment typically operate under contracts with purchase commitments  through which we receive monthly or quarterly payments in exchange for delivering specific orders to the customer 
our net revenue from our defense and intelligence customers has historically been largely from tasking orders and direct access  with a smaller portion from sales of imagery from our imagelibrary 
we believe this trend will continue 
we sell to our defense and intelligence customers both directly and through resellers

most of the costs of a satellite are related to the pre operation capital expenditures required to build and launch a satellite 
there is not a significant direct relationship between our cost of revenue and changes in our net revenue 
our cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of personnel  as well as the cost of operations directly associated with operating our satellites  retrieving information from the satellites and processing the data retrieved 
costs of acquiring aerial imagery from third parties are capitalized and amortized on an accelerated basis as a cost of revenue

additional increases in expense consisted of a million increase in labor related costs  consisting of higher direct labor cost of million primarily due to an increased number of employees  a million increase in bonus expense  higher commissions of million and severance costs of million 
these increases in labor related costs were partially offset by a million decrease in non cash stock compensation expense primarily resulting from a one time charge of million in related to the departure of our previous chief executive officer 
offsetting these increases was a million decrease in bad debt expense

these increases were offset by a million decrease in costs to insure our satellite constellation  primarily due to reduced insurance premiums for worldview as the satellite was in the second year of operation and benefited from lower in orbit insurance 

table of contents depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization consist primarily of depreciation of our satellites and other operating assets 
for year ended december  compared to year ended december  depreciation and amortization decreased by million for the year ended december  to million from million for the year ended december  this decrease consisted of million related to hardware and software becoming fully depreciated and million as a result of an extension to the estimated useful life of our quickbird satellite 
as of october   we revised our estimate of the anticipated useful life of the quickbird satellite until may these decreases were partially offset by million of additional depreciation expense related to new remote ground terminals placed in service during future changes in depreciation and amortization could be affected by commissioning of a new satellite  change in useful life of an existing satellite or introduction of significant new capital assets 
for year ended december  compared to year ended december  depreciation and amortization decreased by million for the year ended december   to million from million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily related to extending the life of the quickbird satellite during the second quarter of interest expense our interest charges consist primarily of interest payments on borrowings used to finance satellite construction  which are capitalized as a cost of our satellite construction

liquidity and capital resources we believe that the combination of funds currently available to us and funds expected to be generated from operations will be adequate to finance our operations and development activities for the next twelve months 
we cannot assure you that the us government will continue to purchase earth imagery or other services from us at similar levels or similar terms 
all of our contracts with the us government agencies are subject to risks of termination or reduction in scope due to changes in us government policies and priorities  or reduced congressional funding level commitments 
pursuant to the contract terms  us government agencies can terminate  modify or suspend our contracts at any time with or without cause 
the us government accounted for of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended december  if the us government were not to renew or extend our contract at similar levels or similar terms  we believe we would be able to maintain operations at a reduced level with existing cash and cash equivalents for at least the next twelve months

our operating leases are primarily for office space in the united states 
we generally believe leasing office space is more cost effective than purchasing real estate for our existing operating locations 
we had million of uncertain tax positions  which are not reflected in the table above since it is unclear when these liabilities will be paid 
the term loan requires quarterly principal payments of million starting june  the remaining balance is due february  interest on adjusted libor based loans is due at the end of each interest period as selected by us  but at least quarterly

non us gaap financial measures ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not recognized terms under generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and may not be defined similarly by other companies 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered alternatives to net income as indications of financial performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operations as measures of liquidity 
there are limitations to using non us gaap financial measures  including the difficulty associated with comparing companies in different industries that use similar performance measures whose calculations may differ from ours 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are key measures used in internal operating reports by management and the board of directors to evaluate the performance of our operations and are also used by analysts  investment banks and lenders for the same purpose 
in  ebitda  excluding certain deal costs  is a measure being used as a key element of the company wide bonus incentive plan 
prior to  adjusted ebitda as previously defined had been a key element of the company wide bonus incentive plan 
ebitda is a measure of our current period operating performance  excluding charges for depreciation related to prior period capital expenditures and items which are generally non core in nature 
adjusted ebitda is a measure of our current period operating performance  excluding charges for capital  depreciation related to prior period capital expenditures and items which are generally non core in nature 
we believe that the elimination of material non cash  non operating items enables a more consistent measurement of period to period performance of our operations 
in addition  we believe that elimination of these items facilitates comparison of our operating performance to companies in our industry 
we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda measures are particularly important in a capital intensive industry such as ours  in which our current period depreciation is not a good indication of our current or future period capital expenditures 
the cost to construct and launch a satellite and to build the related ground infrastructure may vary greatly from one satellite to another  depending on the satellite s size  type and capabilities 
for example  our quickbird satellite  which we are currently depreciating  cost significantly less than our worldview and worldview satellites 
current depreciation expense is not indicative of the net revenue generating potential of the satellite 
ebitda excludes interest income  interest expense and income taxes because these items are associated with our capitalization and tax structures 
ebitda also excludes depreciation and amortization expense because these non cash expenses reflect the impact of prior capital expenditure decisions which are not indicative of future capital expenditure requirements 

table of contents adjusted ebitda further adjusts ebitda to the exclude loss on the early extinguishment of debt  expenses associated with the geoeye combination  loss on derivative instruments and disposal of assets because these are not related to our primary operations 
additionally  it excludes the loss from our joint venture as this is a non cash  non core item 
adjusted ebitda as defined  is not the same definition of adjusted ebitda in our previous filings 
we have revised the definition to exclude certain costs related to our merger with geoeye because we believe these do not reflect our on going operating activity 
additionally  we have removed adjustments related to enhancedview deferred revenue  enhancedview outstanding invoices not yet paid by nga and amortization of pre foc payment related to nextview 
we believe that this revised definition of adjusted ebitda provides better measure of our operating performance 
we use ebitda and adjusted ebitda in conjunction with traditional us gaap operating performance measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance and we do not place undue reliance on measures as our only measures of operating performance 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as substitutes for other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with us gaap 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the policies and estimates below as critical to our current and future business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other significant accounting policies see the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
these policies and estimates are considered critical because they either had a material impact or they have the potential to have a material impact on our financial statements  and because they require significant judgments  assumptions or estimates 
the preparation of our financial statements on form k requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect both the results of operations as well as the carrying values of our assets and liabilities 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we base estimates on historical experience and or on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  making it possible that a change in these estimates could occur in the near term 
set forth below is a summary of our most critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition our principal source of revenue is the licensing of earth imagery products and services for end users and resellers 
revenue is recognized when the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable and the collection of funds is reasonably assured 
our revenue is generated from i sales of or royalties arising from licenses of imagery  and ii subscription services and other service arrangements 
sales of licenses 
revenue from sales of imagery licenses is recognized when the images are physically delivered to the customer or  in the case of electronic delivery  when the customer is able to directly download the image from our system 
in certain customer arrangements  we must satisfy certain acceptance provisions 
for these arrangements  revenue is recognized upon acceptance by these customers 
revenue is recognized net of contractually agreed discounts 
royalties 
revenue from royalties is based on agreements or licenses with third parties that allow the third party to incorporate our product into their value added product for commercial distribution 
revenue from these royalty arrangements is recorded in the period earned or on a systematic basis over the term of the license agreement 
for those royalties that are due to third parties based on our net revenue sharing arrangements  we report royalty revenue on a net basis 

table of contents subscriptions 
we sell online subscriptions to our products 
these arrangements allow customers access to our products via the internet for a set period of time and a fixed fee 
the subscription revenue is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the subscription period 
in addition  we have other arrangements in which customers pay for their subscription to one of our web based products by paying for a predetermined amount of access for example  each time users click on an image of their home 
in the case of prepayment  each time a product is accessed  a portion of the customer s prepayment is earned 
these prepayments are recorded as deferred revenue when received and the revenue is recognized based on the number of times the product is accessed 
revenue is recognized net of discounts 
service level agreements 
we recognize service level agreement revenue net of any allowances resulting from failure to meet certain stated monthly performance metrics 
revenue is either recognized ratably over time for a defined and fixed level of service or based on proportional performance when the level of service changes based on certain criteria stated in the agreement 
multiple deliverable arrangements 
we enter into revenue arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables of our product and service offerings based on the needs of our customers 
these arrangements may include products delivered at the onset of the agreement  as well as products or services that are delivered over multiple reporting periods 
revenue is recognized in the period in which the appropriate net revenue recognition criteria is met 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements and asu  certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
we concurrently adopted asu and asu prospectively on january  asu changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple deliverable arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable based on the relative selling price 
the selling price for each deliverable is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  or best estimate selling price besp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
asu excludes software that is contained in a tangible product from the scope of software revenue guidance if the software is essential to the tangible product s functionality 
we have generally been unable to establish vsoe for any of our products due to our infrequently selling each deliverable separately or only having a limited sales history  such as in the case of new or emerging products 
we have been unable to establish tpe for any of our offerings due to the unique nature of our products and services and the limited number of competitors 
as we are unable to establish price on the basis of vsoe or tpe  we use besp to determine the allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis 
we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple factors  including but not limited to market conditions  competitive landscape  internal costs  gross margin objectives  product technology lifecycles  pricing practices and our go to market strategy 
revenue estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years 
these assumptions include but are not limited to  a lack of evidence of fair value for any undelivered elements  capacity of our constellation and the availability and timing of funding 
in addition  our revenue recognition policy requires an assessment as to whether the collection is reasonably assured  which require us  among other things  to evaluate the credit worthiness of our customers 
changes in these assumptions and estimates could materially affect the timing and or amount of net revenue recognized 
satellites and related ground systems satellites and related ground systems are recorded at cost 
the cost of our satellite includes capitalized interest cost incurred during the construction and development period 
in addition  capitalized costs of our satellite and related ground systems include internal direct labor and project management costs incurred in the construction and development of our satellite and related ground systems 
during the construction phase  the costs of our satellites are capitalized  assuming the eventual successful launch and in orbit operation of the 
table of contents satellite 
the portion of any insurance premiums associated with the insurance coverage of the launch and in orbit commissioning period prior to a satellite reaching start of commercial operations  are capitalized in the original cost of the satellite and are amortized over the estimated life of the asset 
ground systems are placed into service when they are ready for their intended use 
if a satellite were to fail during launch or while in orbit  the resulting loss would be charged to expense in the period in which such loss was to occur 
the amount of any such loss would be reduced to the extent of insurance proceeds received as a result of the launch or in orbit failure 
following each launch  and at least annually thereafter  we review the expected operational life of our satellites 
we determine a satellite s expected operational life using a complex calculation involving the probabilities of failure of the satellite s components from design or manufacturing defects  environmental stresses or other causes 
the expected operational lives of our satellites are affected by a number of factors  including the quality of construction  the supply of fuel  the expected gradual environmental degradation of solar panels and other components  levels of solar radiation  the durability of various satellite components and the orbits in which the satellites are placed 
changes in the estimated useful life of our satellites and the related impact on depreciation expense will be accounted for on a prospective basis and these changes could have a material effect on our financial position 
carrying value of goodwill and other long lived assets we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
we also evaluate goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from its estimated future cash flows 
recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by either performing a qualitative assessment in certain circumstances or by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit  which is measured based upon  among other factors  market multiples for comparable companies as well as a discounted cash flow analysis 
if the recorded value of the assets  including goodwill  and liabilities of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss may be required to be recognized 
further  to the extent the net book value of the company as a whole is greater than its market capitalization  all  or a significant portion of its goodwill may be considered impaired 
during  we did not recognize any impairment of our goodwill in connection with our impairment evaluation 
we review property and equipment and acquired amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
factors that would require an impairment assessment include a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  a significant adverse change in the operations of our satellites  a change in government spending or customer demand that could affect the value of the asset group  or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset group 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of these long lived assets exceeds their fair value 
recoverability of property and equipment and acquired amortizable intangible assets are measured by comparing their carrying amount to the projected cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment loss recognized  if any  is the amount by which the carrying amount of the property and equipment and acquired amortizable intangible assets exceeds fair value 
there were no impairments of long lived assets during income taxes the current provision for income taxes represents actual or estimated amounts payable or refundable on tax returns filed each year 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in enacted tax laws is recognized as an adjustment to the tax provision or benefit in the period of enactment 
the overall change in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period is equal to the deferred tax expense or benefit for the period 
the carrying value of deferred tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based upon the judgmental assessment of available evidence  it is deemed 
table of contents more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realizable 
the recognition of a valuation allowance would result in a reduction to net income and  if significant  could have a material impact on our effective tax rate  results of operations and financial position in any given period 
as of december   there are no income tax positions for which we currently believe that the unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease during the next twelve months 
tax years still open for examination by federal and major state agencies as of december  are through federal and state agencies may disallow research tax carryforwards  net operating loss carryforwards and other carryforwards previously claimed 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively  available to offset future federal and state taxable income 
if not used  the net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various times during the period from to the internal revenue code places certain limitations on the annual amount of net operating loss carryforwards  which can be utilized  if certain changes in our ownership occur 
included in our federal net operating loss carryforward is million that is subject to a million annual internal revenue code limitation  which is expected to be fully utilized in future periods 
recent and pending accounting pronouncements see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements and our expectation of their impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates under our credit facility 
our retired credit facility provided for a million term loan facility and a million revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had not drawn any amounts under the revolving credit facility 
this facility was repaid and retired on january  borrowings under our retired credit facility bore interest  at our option  at a rate equal to either an adjusted libor rate or a base rate  in each case  plus the applicable margin 
the applicable margin for borrowings under the term loan facility was for adjusted libor loans or for base rate loans 
the applicable margin for borrowings under the revolving credit facility change depending upon our leverage ratio  up to a maximum of 
our term loan facility currently bore interest based upon the libor based rate 
based upon the amounts outstanding under the retired credit facility as of december  and assuming that the facility was outstanding for a full calendar year  a basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an increase in our annual interest expense under the facility of approximately million 
in connection with our business combination with geoeye  on january   we entered into a new seven year million senior secured term loan and a five year million senior secured revolving credit facility 
in addition  on january   we issued million of senior notes 
we are exposed to various market risks that arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business 
certain contractual relationships with customers and vendors mitigate risks from currency exchange rate changes that arise from normal purchasing and normal sales activities 
we do not currently have any material foreign currency exposure 
our revenue contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and the majority of our purchase contracts are denominated in us dollars
