our sales of vois are either cash sales or developer financed sales 
in order for us to recognize revenues from voi sales under the full accrual method of accounting as prescribed in the guidance for sales of real estate for fully constructed inventory  a binding sales contract must have been executed  the statutory rescission period must have expired after which time the purchasers are not entitled to a refund except for non delivery by us  receivables must have been deemed collectible and the remainder of our obligations must have been substantially completed 
in addition  before we recognize any revenues from voi sales  the purchaser of the voi must have met the initial investment criteria and  as applicable  the continuing investment criteria  by executing a legally binding financing contract 
a purchaser has met the initial investment criteria when a minimum down payment of is received by us 
in accordance with the guidance for accounting for real estate time sharing transactions  we must also take into consideration the fair value of certain incentives provided to the purchaser when assessing the adequacy of the purchaser s initial investment 
in those cases where financing is provided to the purchaser by us  the purchaser is obligated to remit monthly payments under financing contracts that represent the purchaser s continuing investment 
if all of the criteria for a voi sale to qualify under the full accrual method of accounting have been met  as discussed above  except that construction of the voi purchased is not complete  we recognize revenues using the percentage of completion poc method of accounting provided that the preliminary construction phase is complete and that a minimum sales level has been met to assure that the property will not revert to a rental property 
the preliminary stage of development is deemed to be complete when the engineering and design work is complete  the construction contracts have been executed  the site has been cleared  prepared and excavated  and the building foundation is complete 
the completion percentage is determined by the proportion of real estate inventory costs incurred to total estimated costs 
these estimated costs are based upon historical experience and the related contractual terms 
the remaining revenues and related costs of sales  including commissions and direct expenses  are deferred and recognized as the remaining costs are incurred 
we also offer consumer financing as an option to customers purchasing vois  which are typically collateralized by the underlying voi

an estimate of uncollectible amounts is recorded at the time of the sale with a charge to the provision for loan losses  which is classified as a reduction of voi sales on the consolidated statements of income 
the interest income earned from the financing arrangements is earned on the principal balance outstanding over the life of the arrangement and is recorded within consumer financing on the consolidated statements of income 
we also provide day to day management services  including oversight of housekeeping services  maintenance and certain accounting and administrative services for property owners associations and clubs 
in some cases  our employees serve as officers and or directors of these associations and clubs in accordance with their by laws and associated regulations 
we receive fees for such property management services which are generally based upon total costs to operate such resorts

table of contents other items we record marketing and reservation revenues  wyndham rewards revenues  rci elite rewards revenues and hotel property management services revenues for our lodging  vacation ownership and vacation exchange and rentals segments  in accordance with the guidance for reporting revenues gross as a principal versus net as an agent  which requires that these revenues be recorded on a gross basis 
discussed below are our consolidated results of operations and the results of operations for each of our reportable segments 
the reportable segments presented below represent our operating segments for which separate financial information is available and which is utilized on a regular basis by our chief operating decision maker to assess performance and to allocate resources 
in identifying our reportable segments  we also consider the nature of services provided by our operating segments 
management evaluates the operating results of each of our reportable segments based upon revenues and ebitda  which is defined as net income before depreciation and amortization  interest expense excluding consumer financing interest  early extinguishment of debt  interest income excluding consumer financing interest and income taxes  each of which is presented on the consolidated statements of income

net revenues and ebitda were favorably impacted by million and million  respectively  as a result of the tryp hotel brand acquisition in the second quarter of excluding the impact of the tryp acquisition  net revenues reflects a million increase in royalties  marketing and reservation and wyndham rewards fees primarily due to i a increase in revpar resulting from stronger occupancy and daily rates  ii an increase in our international system size and iii the impact of a million increase related to a change in the classification of third party reservation fees to revenues from marketing expenses  which were misclassified as contra expenses in prior periods 
this change in classification had no impact on ebitda 
net revenue was also favorably impacted by million related due to the opening of our bonnet creek hotel in the fourth quarter of such increases were partially offset by a million decrease in ancillary services revenues and other franchise fees 

table of contents in addition  ebitda was also unfavorably impacted by i million of higher marketing  reservation and wyndham rewards expenses resulting primarily from higher revenues and ii million of operating and pre opening costs for our bonnet creek hotel 
such increase in expenses were partially offset by i million of lower costs principally associated with ancillary services and ii million of lower bad debt expenses 
as of december   we had approximately  properties and  rooms in our system

during the third quarter of  we completed the acquisitions of substantially all of the assets of two vacation rental businesses in colorado and florida 
this resulted in the addition of over  units to our portfolio 
our vacation exchange and rentals business offers its leisure travelers access to approximately  vacation properties worldwide 
acquisitions contributed million of incremental net revenues inclusive of million of ancillary revenues and million of incremental ebitda 
ebitda was also favorably impacted by a decline of million in costs incurred in connection with acquisitions 
excluding the impact of million of incremental vacation rental revenues from acquisitions and the favorable impact of foreign exchange movements of million  net revenues generated from rental transactions and related services increased million primarily due to a increase in average net price per vacation rental 
the increase in average net price per vacation rental resulted from i higher yield at our novasol and landal greenparks businesses and ii an million impact primarily related to a change in the classification of third party sales commission fees to operating expenses which were misclassified as contra revenue in the same period last year 
this change in classification had no impact on ebitda 
rental transaction volume remained relatively flat 
exchange and related service revenues  which primarily consist of fees generated from memberships  exchange transactions  member related rentals and other member servicing  increased million 
excluding million of a favorable impact from foreign exchange movements  exchange and related service revenues remained flat primarily due to an increase in other transaction fee revenue offset by lower exchange and member rental transactions  which we believe are the result of the impact of growth in club memberships where there is a lower propensity to transact 
other transaction fee revenue increased from combining deposited timeshare intervals  which allows members the ability to transact into higher valued vacations  and the impact of a million increase related to a change in the classification of third party credit card processing fees to operating expenses  which were misclassified as contra revenue in prior periods 
this change in classification had no impact on ebitda 
vacation ownership net revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  during compared with gross sales of vois  net of waam sales increased million driven principally by an increase in tour flow and a increase in vpg 
the increase in vpg is attributable to an increase in the average price per transaction  while the change in tour flow reflects our focus on marketing programs directed towards new owner generation 
our provision for loan losses decreased million primarily as a result of improved portfolio performance  partially offset by higher gross voi sales 
in addition  net revenues were unfavorably impacted by a million decrease in ancillary revenues  primarily associated with a misclassification of fees related to incidental voi operations  partially offset by increased fees generated by other non core operations 
this change in classification from gross basis reporting in revenues to net basis reporting in operating expenses had no impact on ebitda 
net revenues and ebitda generated by waam increased by million and million  respectively  due to increased commissions earned on million of higher voi sales under waam property management net revenues and ebitda increased million and million  respectively  resulting primarily from higher reimbursement revenues and higher fees for additional services 
the reimbursement revenues have no impact on ebitda 

table of contents net revenues were unfavorably impacted by million and ebitda was favorably impacted by million due to lower consumer financing revenues attributable to a decline in our contract receivables portfolio which was more than offset in ebitda by a million decrease in interest expense on our securitized debt 
compared to last year  our net interest income margin increased to from due to i a reduction in our weighted average interest rate to from and ii higher weighted average interest rates earned on our contract receivable portfolio  partially offset by million of increased average borrowings on our securitized debt facilities

excluding the impact of these net benefits  corporate expenses increased by million 
the million increase in expenses were primarily due to i million of increased costs for data security enhancements  ii million of higher employee related costs and iii million of an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange hedging contracts costs partially offset by a million gain related to the redemption of a preferred stock investment allocated to us in connection with the separation 
other revenues decreased by million with a corresponding decrease in expenses due to the elimination of the wyndham trademark fee charged between the lodging segment and the vacation ownership segment 
restructuring plans restructuring plans during  we committed to an organizational realignment initiative at our vacation exchange and rentals business  primarily focused on consolidating existing processes and optimizing its structure partially due to a shift by members to transact online resulting from the enhancements we have made to rci

such decreases were partially offset by million of net income attributable to wyndham shareholders 
liquidity and capital resources currently  our financing needs are supported by cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program 
in addition  certain funding requirements of our vacation ownership business are met through the utilization of our bank conduit facility and the issuance of securitized debt to finance vacation ownership contract receivables 
we believe that our net cash from operations  cash and cash equivalents  access to our revolving credit facility  commercial paper program and continued access to the securitization and debt markets provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our ongoing needs 
our five year revolving credit facility has a total capacity of billion and available capacity of million  net of letters of credit as of december  we consider outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program to be a reduction of the available capacity on our revolving credit facility  as such  the available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility was million as of december  during october  we initiated a commercial paper program on a private placement basis under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum amount of million 
we do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper  therefore  our issuances are subject to market demand 
we allocate a portion of our available capacity under our revolving credit facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature 
we classify outstanding borrowings under this program as short term debt and include such borrowings in current portion of long term debt on our consolidated balance sheet

such non cash adjustments to net income were primarily comprised of i the loss of early extinguishment of debt  ii a higher provision from loan losses and iii a decrease in asset impairments 
cash utilized for working capital net change in assets and liabilities decreased million resulting primarily from a million increase in vacation ownership contract receivable due to higher voi sales 
such increase was partially offset by the absence of a million refund for value added taxes and related interest during of which million was recognized through working capital and million was included in net income 
investing activities during  net cash used in investing activities increased by million as compared to  which principally reflects million of higher payments for acquisitions  a million increase in investments primarily related to an additional investment in a joint venture that owned the rio mar hotel  and a million reduction in cash received from asset sales primarily related to the absence of the sale of a preferred stock investment during such increases in cash outflows were offset by a million decrease in capital expenditures primarily as a result of the absence of construction costs incurred during for our bonnet creek hotel 
financing activities during  net cash used in financing activities decreased million as compared to  which principally reflects million of higher proceeds from issuance of notes  million of net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper  million of lower share repurchases  and million of lower repayments repurchases of convertible notes

capital deployment we are focusing on optimizing cash flow and seeking to deploy capital for the highest possible returns 
ultimately  our business objective is to grow our business while transforming our cash and earnings profile by rebalancing our cash streams to achieve a greater proportion of ebitda from our fee for service businesses

we believe that our vacation ownership business currently has adequate finished inventory on our balance sheet to support vacation ownership sales 
after factoring in the anticipated additional average spending of approximately million annually from through  we expect to have adequate inventory through at least the next to years 
we expect that the majority of the expenditures that will be required to pursue our capital spending programs  strategic investments and vacation ownership development projects will be financed with cash flow generated through operations 
additional expenditures are financed with general unsecured corporate borrowings  including through the use of available capacity under our revolving credit facility

long term debt covenants the revolving credit facility is subject to covenants including the maintenance of specific financial ratios 
the financial ratio covenants consist of a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least to as of the measurement date and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio not to exceed to as of the measurement date 
the consolidated interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement by consolidated interest expense as defined in the credit agreement  both as measured on a trailing month basis preceding the measurement date 
as of december   our consolidated interest coverage ratio was times 
consolidated interest expense excludes  among other things  interest expense on any securitization indebtedness as defined in the credit agreement 
the consolidated leverage ratio is calculated by dividing consolidated total indebtedness as defined in the credit agreement and which excludes  among other things  securitization indebtedness as of the measurement date by consolidated ebitda as measured on a trailing month basis preceding the measurement date 
as of december   our consolidated leverage ratio was times 
covenants in this credit facility also include limitations on indebtedness of material subsidiaries  liens  mergers  consolidations  liquidations and dissolutions  sale of all or substantially all of our assets  and sale and leaseback transactions 
events of default in this credit facility include failure to pay interest  principal and fees when due  breach of a covenant or warranty  acceleration of or failure to pay other debt in excess of million excluding securitization indebtedness  insolvency matters  and a change of control 
all of our senior unsecured notes contain various covenants including limitations on liens  limitations on potential sale and leaseback transactions and change of control restrictions 
in addition  there are limitations on mergers  consolidations and potential sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
events of default in the notes include failure to pay interest and principal when due  breach of a covenant or warranty  acceleration of other debt in excess of million excluding securitization indebtedness and insolvency matters 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants described above 
each of our non recourse  securitized term notes and the bank conduit facility contain various triggers relating to the performance of the applicable loan pools 
if the vacation ownership contract receivables pool that collateralizes one of our securitization notes fails to perform within the parameters established by the contractual triggers such as higher default or delinquency rates  there are provisions pursuant to which the cash flows for that pool will be maintained in the securitization as extra collateral for the note holders or applied to accelerate the repayment of outstanding principal to the note holders 
as of december   all of our securitized loan pools were in compliance with applicable contractual triggers 
liquidity risk our vacation ownership business finances certain of its receivables through i an asset backed bank conduit facility and ii periodically accessing the capital markets by issuing asset backed securities 
none of the currently outstanding asset backed securities contains any recourse provisions to us other than interest rate risk related to swap counterparties solely to the extent that the amount outstanding on our notes differs from the forecasted amortization schedule at the time of issuance 
we believe that our bank conduit facility  with a term through august and capacity of million  combined with our ability to issue term asset backed securities  should provide sufficient liquidity for our expected sales pace and we expect to have available liquidity to finance the sale of vois 
as of december   we had million of availability under our asset backed bank conduit facility 
any disruption to the asset backed securities market could adversely impact our ability to obtain such financings 

table of contents our billion five year revolving credit agreement  which expires in july  contains a provision that is a condition of an extension of credit 
the provision  which was standard market practice for issuers of our rating and industry at the time of our revolver renewal  allows the lenders to withhold an extension of credit if the representations and warranties we made at the time we executed the revolving credit facility agreement are not true and correct in all material respects at the time of request of the extension for credit including if a development or event has or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business  assets  operations or condition  financial or otherwise 
the application of the material adverse effect provision contains an exclusion for the impact resulting from disruptions in  or the inability of companies engaged in businesses similar to those engaged in by us and our subsidiaries to consummate financings in  the asset backed securities or conduit market 
during october  we initiated a commercial paper program on a private placement basis under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum amount of million 
we do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper  therefore  our issuances are subject to market demand 
we allocate a portion of our available capacity under our revolving credit facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature 
as of december   we had million of outstanding borrowings and the total available capacity was million 
we primarily utilize surety bonds at our vacation ownership business for sales and development transactions in order to meet regulatory requirements of certain states 
in the ordinary course of our business  we have assembled commitments from twelve surety providers in the amount of billion  of which we had million outstanding as of december  the availability  terms and conditions and pricing of such bonding capacity are dependent on  among other things  continued financial strength and stability of the insurance company affiliates providing such bonding capacity  the general availability of such capacity and our corporate credit rating 
if such bonding capacity is unavailable  or alternatively  if the terms and conditions and pricing of such bonding capacity are unacceptable to us  our vacation ownership business could be negatively impacted 
our liquidity position may also be negatively affected by unfavorable conditions in the capital markets in which we operate or if our vacation ownership contract receivables portfolios do not meet specified portfolio credit parameters 
our liquidity as it relates to our vacation ownership contract receivables securitization program could be adversely affected if we were to fail to renew or replace our conduit facility on its expiration date  or if a particular receivables pool were to fail to meet certain ratios  which could occur in certain instances if the default rates or other credit metrics of the underlying vacation ownership contract receivables deteriorate 
our ability to sell securities backed by our vacation ownership contract receivables depends on the continued ability and willingness of capital market participants to invest in such securities

seasonality we experience seasonal fluctuations in our net revenues and net income from our franchise and management fees  commission income earned from renting vacation properties  annual subscription fees or annual membership dues  as applicable  and exchange and member related transaction fees and sales of vois 
revenues from franchise and management fees are generally higher in the second and third quarters than in the first or fourth quarters  because of increased leisure travel during the summer months 
revenues from vacation rentals are generally highest in the third quarter  when vacation arrivals are highest  combined with a compressed booking window 
revenues from vacation exchange and member related transaction fees are generally highest in the first quarter  which is generally when members of our vacation exchange business plan and book their vacations for the year 
revenues from sales of vois are generally higher in the third quarter than in other quarters 
the seasonality of our business may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
as we expand into new markets and geographical locations  we may experience increased or different seasonality dynamics that create fluctuations in operating results different from the fluctuations we have experienced in the past 

table of contents commitments and contingencies we are involved in claims  legal and regulatory proceedings and governmental inquiries related to our business 
litigation is inherently unpredictable and  although we believe that our accruals are adequate and or that we have valid defenses in these matters  unfavorable results could occur 
as such  an adverse outcome from such proceedings for which claims are awarded in excess of the amounts accrued  if any  could be material to us with respect to earnings or cash flows in any given reporting period 
as of december   the potential exposure resulting from adverse outcomes of such legal proceedings could  in the aggregate  range up to approximately million in excess of recorded accruals 
however  we do not believe that the impact of such litigation should result in a material liability to us in relation to our consolidated financial position or liquidity

in addition to the above and in connection with our separation  we entered into certain guarantee commitments with cendant pursuant to our assumption of certain liabilities and our obligation to indemnify cendant  realogy and travelport for such liabilities and guarantee commitments related to deferred compensation arrangements with each of cendant and realogy 
these guarantee arrangements primarily relate to certain contingent litigation liabilities  contingent tax liabilities  and cendant contingent and other corporate liabilities  of which we assumed and are responsible for of these cendant liabilities 
additionally  if any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability  we are responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties obligation 
we also provide a default guarantee related to certain deferred compensation arrangements related to certain current and former senior officers and directors of cendant and realogy 
these arrangements were valued upon our separation with the assistance of third party experts in accordance with guidance for guarantees and recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet 
to the extent such recorded liabilities are not adequate to cover the ultimate payment amounts  such excess will be reflected as an expense to our results of operations in future periods 
other commercial commitments and off balance sheet arrangements purchase commitments

individually  such commitments range as high as million related to the development of a vacation ownership resort 
approximately million of the commitments relate to the development of vacation ownership properties and information technology 

table of contents standard guarantees indemnifications 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into agreements that contain standard guarantees and indemnities whereby we indemnify another party for specified breaches of or third party claims relating to an underlying agreement 
such underlying agreements are typically entered into by one of our subsidiaries 
the various underlying agreements generally govern purchases  sales or outsourcing of products or services  leases of real estate  licensing of software and or development of vacation ownership properties  access to credit facilities  derivatives and issuances of debt securities 
while a majority of these guarantees and indemnifications extend only for the duration of the underlying agreement  some survive the expiration of the agreement 
we are not able to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments to be made under these guarantees and indemnifications as the triggering events are not predictable 
in certain cases we maintain insurance coverage that may mitigate any potential payments 
other guarantees indemnifications 
in the ordinary course of business  our vacation ownership business provides guarantees to certain owners associations for funds required to operate and maintain vacation ownership properties in excess of assessments collected from owners of the vois 
we may be required to fund such excess as a result of unsold company owned vois or failure by owners to pay such assessments 
in addition  from time to time  we will agree to reimburse certain owner associations up to of their uncollected assessments 
these guarantees extend for the duration of the underlying subsidy or similar agreement which generally approximate one year and are renewable at our discretion on an annual basis or until a stipulated percentage typically or higher of related vois are sold 
the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make under these guarantees was approximately million as of december  we would only be required to pay this maximum amount if none of the assessed owners paid their assessments 
any assessments collected from the owners of the vois would reduce the maximum potential amount of future payments to be made by us 
additionally  should we be required to fund the deficit through the payment of any owners assessments under these guarantees  we would be permitted access to the property for our own use and may use that property to engage in revenue producing activities  such as rentals 
during  and  we made payments related to these guarantees of million  million and million  respectively 
as of december  and  we maintained a liability in connection with these guarantees of million and million  respectively  on our consolidated balance sheets 
as part of our waam programs  we may guarantee to reimburse the developer a certain payment or to purchase from the developer inventory associated with the developer s resort property for a percentage of the original sale price if certain future conditions exist 
the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make under these guarantees was approximately million as of december  as of both december  and  we had no recognized liabilities in connection with these guarantees 
during january  we entered into an agreement with guggenheim partners whereby guggenheim will acquire a hotel through a spe 
we will manage and operate the hotel while guggenheim converts the hotel into timeshare units 
we have committed to purchase such timeshare units from guggenheim over a year period for a guaranteed price 
since we are considered to be the primary beneficiary of the spe  we are required to consolidate the spe within our financial statements 
beginning with the first quarter of  the consolidation of this spe will result in an increase of approximately million to property and equipment and long term debt on our consolidated balance sheet 
from time to time  we may enter into a hotel management agreement that provides the hotel owner with a guarantee of a certain level of profitability based upon various metrics 
under such an agreement  we would be required to compensate the hotel owner for any shortfall over the life of the management agreement up to a specified aggregate amount 
for certain agreements  we may be able to recapture a portion or all of the shortfall payments in the event that future operating results exceed targets 
as of december   the maximum potential amount of future payments to be made under these guarantees was million with an annual cap of million 
as of december   we maintained a liability in connection with these guarantees of million  on our consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  on january   we executed an agreement with felcor lodging trust incorporated for the management of eight hotel properties which will be rebranded to wyndham brands 
with such an agreement  we may be required to compensate for any profitability shortfalls at the hotels over the ten year life of management agreement 
the maximum potential amount of future payments that may be made under these guarantees is million with an annual cap of million 
securitizations 
we pool qualifying vacation ownership contract receivables and sell them to bankruptcy remote entities all of which are consolidated into the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  letters of credit 
as of december   we had million of irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding  of which million were under our revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had million of irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding all of which were under our revolving credit facility 
such letters of credit issued during and primarily supported certain insurance policies and development activity at our vacation ownership business 

table of contents surety bonds 
as of december   we had assembled commitments from twelve surety providers in the amount of billion  of which million was outstanding 
see note commitments and contingencies critical accounting policies in presenting our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein 
several of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events 
however  events that are outside of our control cannot be predicted and  as such  they cannot be contemplated in evaluating such estimates and assumptions 
if there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions  it could result in a material impact to our consolidated results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions we used when preparing our financial statements were the most appropriate at that time 
presented below are those accounting policies that we believe require subjective and complex judgments that could potentially affect reported results 
however  the majority of our businesses operate in environments where we are paid a fee for a service performed  and therefore the results of the majority of our recurring operations are recorded in our financial statements using accounting policies that are not particularly subjective  nor complex 
vacation ownership revenue recognition 
our sales of vois are either cash sales or seller financed sales 
in order for us to recognize revenues of voi sales under the full accrual method of accounting as prescribed in the guidance for sales of real estate for fully constructed inventory  a binding sales contract must have been executed  the statutory rescission period must have expired after which time the purchasers are not entitled to a refund except for non delivery by us  receivables must have been deemed collectible and the remainder of our obligations must have been substantially completed 
in addition  before we recognize any revenues on voi sales  the purchaser of the voi must have met the initial investment criteria and  as applicable  the continuing investment criteria  by executing a legally binding financing contract 
a purchaser has met the initial investment criteria when a minimum down payment of is received by us 
in accordance with the requirements of the guidance for real estate time sharing transactions  we must also take into consideration the fair value of certain incentives provided to the purchaser when assessing the adequacy of the purchaser s initial investment 
in those cases where financing is provided to the purchaser by us  the purchaser is obligated to remit monthly payments under financing contracts that represent the purchaser s continuing investment 
the contractual terms of seller provided financing arrangements require that the contractual level of annual principal payments be sufficient to amortize the loan over a customary period for the voi being financed  which is generally ten years  and payments under the financing contracts begin within days of the sale and receipt of the minimum down payment of 
if all of the criteria for a voi sale to qualify under the full accrual method of accounting have been met  as discussed above  except that construction of the voi purchased is not complete  we recognize revenues using the poc method of accounting provided that the preliminary construction phase is complete and that a minimum sales level has been met to assure that the property will not revert to a rental property 
the preliminary stage of development is deemed to be complete when the engineering and design work is complete  the construction contracts have been executed  the site has been cleared  prepared and excavated  and the building foundation is complete 
the completion percentage is determined by the proportion of real estate inventory costs incurred to total estimated costs 
these estimated costs are based upon historical experience and the related contractual terms 
the remaining revenues and related costs of sales  including commissions and direct expenses  are deferred and recognized as the remaining costs are incurred 
until a contract for sale qualifies for revenue recognition  all payments received are accounted for as restricted cash and deposits within other current assets and deferred income  respectively  on the consolidated balance sheets 
commissions and other direct costs related to the sale are deferred until the sale is recorded 
if a contract is cancelled before qualifying as a sale  non recoverable expenses are charged to the current period as part of operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income 
changes in costs could lead to adjustments to the poc status of a project  which may result in differences in the timing and amount of revenues recognized from the construction of vacation ownership properties 
this policy is discussed in greater detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses 
in our vacation ownership segment  we provide for estimated vacation ownership contract receivable cancellations at the time of voi sales by recording a provision for loan losses as a reduction of voi sales on the consolidated statements of income 
we assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses based on the historical performance of similar vacation ownership contract receivables 
we use a technique referred to as static pool analysis  which tracks defaults for each year s sales over the entire life of those contract receivables 
we consider current defaults  past due aging  historical write offs of contracts and consumer credit scores fico scores in the assessment of borrower s credit strength  down payment amount and expected loan performance 
we also consider whether the historical economic conditions are comparable to current economic conditions 
if current conditions differ from the conditions in effect when the historical experience was generated  we adjust the allowance for loan losses to reflect the expected effects of the current environment on the collectability of our vacation ownership contract receivables 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets 
with regard to the goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets recorded in connection with business combinations  we annually during the fourth quarter of each year subsequent to completing our annual forecasting process or  more frequently if circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired  review the reporting units carrying values as required by the guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets 
for goodwill impairment testing  we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test per the accounting guidance is unnecessary 
the qualitative factors evaluated include macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  cost factors  overall financial performance  our historical share price as well as other industry specific considerations 
however  if we conclude otherwise  then we are required to perform the first step of the two step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
to the extent estimated market based valuation multiples and or discounted cash flows are revised downward  we may be required to write down all or a portion of goodwill  which would adversely impact earnings 
based on the results of our qualitative assessment performed during the fourth quarter of  we determined that no impairment existed  nor do we believe there is a material risk of it being impaired in the near term at our lodging  vacation exchange and rentals and vacation ownership reporting units 
we also determine whether the carrying value of other indefinite lived intangible assets is impaired on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist 
application of the other indefinite lived intangible assets impairment test requires judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine fair value 
the fair value of each other indefinite lived intangible asset is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology 
this analysis requires significant judgments  including anticipated market conditions  operating expense trends  estimation of future cash flows  which are dependent on internal forecasts  and estimation of long term rate of growth 
the estimates used to calculate the fair value of an other indefinite lived intangible asset change from year to year based on operating results and market conditions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and the other indefinite lived intangible assets impairment 
we also evaluate the recoverability of our other long lived assets  including property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets  if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred  pursuant to guidance for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this analysis is performed by comparing the respective carrying values of the assets to the current and expected future cash flows  on an undiscounted basis  to be generated from such assets 
property and equipment is evaluated separately within each segment 
if such analysis indicates that the carrying value of these assets is not recoverable  the carrying value of such assets is reduced to fair value 
business combinations 
a component of our growth strategy has been to acquire and integrate businesses that complement our existing operations 
we account for business combinations in accordance with the guidance for business combinations and related literature 
accordingly  we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of purchase 
the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination  we use various recognized valuation methods including present value modeling and referenced market values where available 
further  we make assumptions within certain valuation techniques including discount rates and timing of future cash flows 
valuations are performed by management or independent valuation specialists under management s supervision  where appropriate 
we believe that the estimated fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions that marketplace participants would use 
however  such assumptions are inherently uncertain and actual results could differ from those estimates 
accounting for restructuring activities 
restructuring actions require us to make significant estimates in several areas including i expenses for severance and related benefit costs  ii the ability to generate sublease income  as well as our ability to terminate lease obligations  and iii contract terminations 
the amount that we have accrued as of december  represent our best estimate of the obligations that we incurred in connection with these actions  but could be subject to change due to various factors including market conditions and the outcome of negotiations with third parties 

table of contents income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets that we believe will not be ultimately realized 
in performing this review  we make estimates and assumptions regarding projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
a change in these assumptions may increase or decrease our valuation allowance resulting in an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate  which could materially impact our results of operations 
for tax positions we have taken or expect to take in our tax return  we apply a more likely than not threshold  under which we must conclude a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained  assuming that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information  in order to recognize or continue to recognize the benefit 
in determining our provision for income taxes  we use judgment  reflecting our estimates and assumptions  in applying the more likely than not threshold 
adoption of accounting pronouncements during  we adopted the guidance related to the accounting for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
additionally  we early adopted recently issued guidance related to the presentation of comprehensive income 
during  we adopted guidance related to the testing of goodwill for impairment  testing of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment and fair value measurement 
for detailed information regarding these standards and the impact thereof on our financial statements  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use various financial instruments  particularly swap contracts and interest rate caps  to manage and reduce the interest rate risk related to our debt 
foreign currency forwards and options are also used to manage and reduce the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign currency denominated receivables and payables  and forecasted royalties  forecasted earnings and cash flows of foreign subsidiaries and other transactions 
we are exclusively an end user of these instruments  which are commonly referred to as derivatives 
we do not engage in trading  market making or other speculative activities in the derivatives markets 
more detailed information about these financial instruments is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our principal market exposures are interest and foreign currency rate risks 
our primary interest rate exposure as of december  was to interest rate fluctuations in the united states  specifically libor and asset backed commercial paper interest rates due to their impact on variable rate borrowings and other interest rate sensitive liabilities 
in addition  interest rate movements in one country  as well as relative interest rate movements between countries can impact us 
we anticipate that libor and asset backed commercial paper rates will remain a primary market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
we have foreign currency rate exposure to exchange rate fluctuations worldwide and particularly with respect to the british pound and euro 
we anticipate that such foreign currency exchange rate risk will remain a market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
any adverse reaction resulting from the financial instability within certain european economies could potentially have an effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
we assess our market risk based on changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis measures the potential impact in earnings  fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical change increase and decrease in interest and foreign currency exchange rates 
we have approximately billion of debt outstanding as of december  of that total  million was issued as variable rate debt and has not been synthetically converted to fixed rate debt via an interest rate swap 
a hypothetical change in our effective weighted average interest rate would not generate a material change in interest expense 
the fair values of cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables  accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate carrying values due to the short term nature of these assets and liabilities 
we use a discounted cash flow model in determining the fair values of vacation ownership contract receivables 
the primary assumptions used in determining fair value are prepayment speeds  estimated loss rates and discount rates 
we use a duration based model in determining the impact of interest rate shifts on our debt and interest rate derivatives 
the primary assumption used in these models is that a increase or decrease in the benchmark interest rate produces a parallel shift in the yield curve across all maturities 

table of contents we use a current market pricing model to assess the changes in the value of our foreign currency derivatives used by us to hedge underlying exposure that primarily consist of the non functional current assets and liabilities of us and our subsidiaries 
the primary assumption used in these models is a hypothetical weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against all our currency exposures as of december  the gains and losses on the hedging instruments are largely offset by the gains and losses on the underlying assets  liabilities or expected cash flows 
as of december   the absolute notional amount of our outstanding foreign exchange hedging instruments was million 
a hypothetical change in the foreign currency exchange rates would result in an immaterial change in the fair value of the hedging instrument as of december  such a change would be largely offset by an opposite effect on the underlying assets  liabilities and expected cash flows 
our total market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors including the volatility present within the markets and the liquidity of the markets 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented 
while probably the most meaningful analysis  these shock tests are constrained by several factors  including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and the inability to include the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
we used december  market rates on outstanding financial instruments to perform the sensitivity analysis separately for each of our market risk exposures interest and foreign currency rate instruments 
the estimates are based on the market risk sensitive portfolios described in the preceding paragraphs and assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in interest rate yield curves and exchange rates
