critical accounting policies and accounting estimates critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies upon which our financial condition depends  and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments are as follows 
reserve for credit losses the company s reserve for credit losses provides for estimated losses based upon evaluations of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio and related loan commitments 
arriving at an estimate of the appropriate level of reserve for credit losses which consists of our reserve for loan losses and our reserve for loan 
table of contents commitments involves a high degree of judgment and assessment of multiple variables that result in a methodology with relatively complex calculations and analysis 
management uses historical information to assess the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses and considers qualitative factors including economic conditions and a range of other factors in its determination of the reserve 
on an ongoing basis  the company seeks to enhance and refine its methodology such that the reserve is at an appropriate level and responsive to changing conditions 
however  the company s methodology may not accurately estimate inherent loss or external factors and changing economic conditions may impact the loan portfolio and the level of reserves in ways currently unforeseen 
the reserve for loan losses is increased by provisions for loan losses and by recoveries of loans previously charged off and reduced by loans charged off 
the reserve for loan commitments is increased and decreased through non interest expense 
for a full discussion of the company s methodology of assessing the adequacy of the reserve for credit losses  see loan portfolio and credit quality below in this item deferred income taxes the provision credit for income taxes is based on income and expenses as reported for consolidated financial statement purposes using the asset and liability method for accounting for deferred taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled 
as changes in tax laws or rates are enacted  deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision credit for income taxes 
a valuation allowance  if needed  reduces deferred tax assets to the expected amount to be realized 
income tax positions that meet a more likely than not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of income tax benefit that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority 
the portion of the benefits associated with income tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above would be reflected as a liability for unrecognized income tax benefits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination 
interest and penalties associated with unrecognized income tax benefits would be classified as additional income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations 
due to cumulative losses incurred by the company in prior years and related considerations  the company is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will realize its net deferred tax asset and  accordingly  has recorded a valuation allowance to fully offset its deferred tax asset at december  and realization of deferred tax assets is generally dependent upon the company generating future taxable income  and is subject to limitations arising from the capital raise that could result in permanent impairment of a material portion of the company s deferred tax assets and or limit deductibility of certain losses 
as broadly defined in section of the internal revenue code  the issuance of common stock in connection with the company s capital raise in resulted in an ownership change of the company 
as a result of the ownership change  utilization of the company s net operating loss carry forwards  tax credit carry forwards and certain built in losses under federal income tax laws will be subject to annual limitations and may be disallowed 
the annual limitation imposed under section may limit the deduction for both the carry forward tax attributes and the built in losses realized within one to five years of the date of the ownership change 
given the complexity of application of section and the carry forward limitations  a material portion of these potential attributes may be disallowed 
other real estate owned and foreclosed assets other real estate owned and other foreclosed assets acquired through loan foreclosure are initially recorded at estimated fair value less costs to sell when acquired  establishing a new cost basis 
the adjustment at the time of foreclosure is recorded through the reserve for loan losses 
due to the subjective nature of establishing the asset s fair value when it is acquired  the actual fair value of the other real estate owned or foreclosed asset could differ from the original estimate 
if it is determined that fair value declines subsequent to foreclosure  a valuation allowance is recorded through non interest expense 
operating costs associated with the assets after 
table of contents acquisition are also recorded as non interest expense 
gains and losses on the disposition of other real estate owned and foreclosed assets are netted and posted to other non interest expenses 
economic conditions the company business is closely tied to the economies of oregon and the greater boise treasure valley  idaho area 
the company s financial performance is directly and consequentially affected by the ability of borrowers to pay interest on  and repay principal of  outstanding loans 
the slow recovery and uncertain economic outlook constrains business and consumer incomes  cash reserves  and the value of collateral securing loans 
business activity has stabilized generally  along with real estate values  with modestly increasing prices evident in housing 
similarly  unemployment rates have stabilized yet with only modest improvement despite the recovering economy 
businesses are facing challenges due to elevated unemployment and economic uncertainty 
the uncertain state of the economy and slow recovery could cause further deterioration of the economies of our primary markets  resulting in an adverse effect on the company financial condition and results of operations consolidated results of operations years ended december    and net income loss our consolidated results of operations are dependent to a large degree on our net interest income 
we also generate other income primarily through service charges and fees  card issuer and merchant service fees  earnings on bank owned life insurance boli and mortgage banking income 
our operating expenses consist in large part of compensation  employee benefits expense  occupancy  communications  equipment  insurance expenses  professional and outside services  and expenses related to oreo 
interest income and cost of funds are affected significantly by general economic conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  and by government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
in the company recorded net income of million  compared to a net loss of million in and a net loss of million in during these periods  net income loss per share was  and  respectively 
the return to profitability in is attributable to significantly reduced credit costs  including a lower loan loss provision and reduced cost incurred in connection with the disposition of oreo 
the company recorded a million loan loss provision in  significantly below the million loan loss provision made in and the million loan loss provision made in oreo related expenses declined to million  compared to million in and million in also benefited from revitalized residential mortgage originations which contributed million to net income  compared to million in and million in net interest income for most financial institutions  including the company  the primary component of earnings is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned  principally from loans and investment securities portfolio  and interest paid  principally on customer deposits and borrowings 
changes in net interest income typically result from changes in volume  spread and margin 
volume refers to the dollar level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
spread refers to the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
margin refers to net interest income divided by interest earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income was million in  a million or decrease from net interest income decreased million or in over yields earned on assets decreased to for as compared to in and in due to declining market interest rates and because lower yielding securities increased while loan balances decreased 
meanwhile  the average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities for decreased to compared to in and in total interest income decreased million or due mainly to significantly lower average earning loans 
total interest income decreased approximately million or also due to lower average earning loans as well as interest reversals on loans being placed on non accrual  and interest foregone on non performing loans 
total interest expense declined by million or in as compared to 
table of contents mainly due to reduced volumes of time deposits and borrowings which carry higher rates than core deposits 
similarly interest expense declined million or as compared to as higher cost liabilities were reduced including borrowings from fhlb and extinguishment of the debentures 
the overall decline in net interest income from through was largely a result of declining average loan balances over the same periods 
the company is working to increase loan balances through continued marketing efforts in our banking area 
net interest margin nim the company s net interest margin nim increased to for compared to for and for the increase was primarily due to lower cost of funds resulting from a reduction in higher cost liabilities 

table of contents the following table presents further analysis of the components of cascade s nim and sets forth for   and information with regard to average balances of assets and liabilities  as well as total dollar amounts of interest income from interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  resultant average yields or rates  net interest income  net interest spread  net interest margin and the ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities for the company

the increase in our provision level over was mainly due to charge offs incurred in the bulk sale  as well as risk rating changes within the loan portfolio and higher than expected loss on impaired loans 
at december   the reserve for loan losses was approximately million while the reserve for unfunded commitments was million  as compared to a reserve for loan losses of million and a reserve for unfunded commitments of million at december  the bank maintains pooled and impaired loan reserves with additional consideration of qualitative factors and unallocated reserves in reaching its determination of the total reserve for loan losses 
the level of reserves is subject to review by the bank s regulatory authorities who may require adjustments to the reserve based on their evaluation and opinion of economic and industry factors as well as specific loans in the portfolio 
for further discussion  see critical accounting policies and estimates and loan portfolio and credit quality elsewhere in item of this report 
there can be no assurance that the reserve for credit losses will be sufficient to cover actual loan related losses 
non interest income non interest income increased million or in compared to due primarily to a million increase in gain on sale of residential mortgage originations 
mortgage volumes were significantly higher in due to improving market conditions and lower interest rates 
somewhat offsetting improved mortgage revenue were lower service charges which continued to decline in due to lower transaction volumes and effects of regulatory changes 
total non interest income decreased million or compared to due to lower service charges as a result of declining transaction volumes and effects of regulatory changes 
specifically  the dodd frank act placed limitations on charges for overdraft protection and other fees  contributing to a million year over year decline 
partially offsetting the declines were increased income from boli of million 

table of contents non interest expenses non interest expense was lower in virtually all categories in  and in total decreased million or compared to much of the reduction was a result of lower credit related costs that reflect the improving economy 
specifically oreo expenses declined million or compared to due to significantly lower valuation allowance additions and lower operating costs 
this improvement was achieved in part because of stabilizing real estate prices as well as the provision of a million oreo valuation allowance to expedite disposition of the portfolio 
this strategy resulted in a reduction of oreo from million at year end to million at december  oreo expenses also benefited from lower operating costs on a declining portfolio 
noninterest expenses were also lower due to several other favorable changes in as compared to the reserve for unfunded commitments was reduced by million in as result of changing estimates of applicable loss factors and usage levels for unused loan commitments 
prepayment penalties on borrowings declined from million in to zero in in addition  other expenses were higher than in due in large part to our million write off of our core deposit intangible cdi in  a litigation settlement in  and costs attendant to our ceo transition that were incurred in non interest expense increased million or compared to the elevated expense included a million increase related to oreo valuation  disposition  and operating costs  a one time million charge to fully impair our cdi asset  and million in costs for prepayment of certain borrowings 
also salaries and employee benefits increased million primarily related to executive management transition costs 
professional services increased million from  mainly due to professional fees and other expense related to our ceo transition  while costs related to settlement of litigation recorded in other expenses helped increase other expenses by million from the level 
partially offsetting these increases was a million reduction in fdic insurance expense costs compared to resulting from the company s improved capital ratios and consequent lower insurance assessment rate 
also the fdic insurance assessment base was changed from average quarterly deposits to average quarterly assets effective april   which generally benefited community banks including the company

table of contents income taxes due to cumulative losses incurred by the company in years prior to and other relevant factors  the company is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will realize its net deferred tax asset and  accordingly  has recorded a valuation allowance to fully offset its deferred tax asset at december  and realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company generating future taxable income  and is subject to limitations arising from the capital raise that could result in permanent impairment of a material portion of the company s deferred tax assets and or limit deductibility of certain losses 
as of december   the company maintained a valuation allowance against its deferred tax asset 
this amount represented a million decrease from year end due to changes in temporary differences between the financial statement and tax recognition of revenue and expenses and a reduction of deferred tax assets due to section of the internal revenue code 
as broadly defined in section of the internal revenue code  the issuance of common stock in connection with the company s capital raise in resulted in an ownership change of the company 
as a result of the ownership change  utilization of the company s net operating loss carry forwards  tax credit carry forwards and certain built in losses under federal income tax laws will be subject to annual limitations and potential impairment 
the annual limitation imposed under section may limit the deduction for both the carry forward tax attributes and the built in losses realized within five years of the date of the ownership change 
management determined the amount of the deferred tax valuation allowance at december  and december  by evaluating the nature and amount of historical and projected future taxable income and the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities  and available tax planning strategies 
the ability to utilize deferred tax assets is a complex process requiring in depth analysis of statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance and estimates of future taxable income 
the amount of deferred taxes recognized could be impacted by changes to any of these variables 
the company recorded an income tax provision of million in  an income tax provision of million in and a tax benefit of million in the provision of million also includes a credit for income taxes of approximately million related to the company s loss from operations excluding the extraordinary gain 
financial condition balance sheet overview at december   total assets were billion  comparable to total assets at december  total net loans declined million to million at december  compared to million at december  the lower loan balance was a result of borrower payoffs and paydowns 
the investment portfolio increased to million at december  as compared to million a year earlier as the company deployed excess liquidity into securities 
as a result of the redeployment of excess liquidity  total cash and cash equivalents at december  decreased million or compared to december  oreo balances at december  were million compared to million at december   a million or decline from december  the decline in oreo balances from to was primarily a result of dispositions of oreo as a result of a board decision in late to strategically expedite the liquidation of oreo as part of the effort to reduce classified assets during total deposits decreased million or at december  as compared to december  core deposits deposits  excluding time increased from december  levels  partially offsetting a million decline in time deposits 
the shift of deposits from time deposits and interest bearing demand deposits into demand deposits and savings deposits is evidence of an improving deposit mix as customers are moving their cash to more liquid funds  including operating accounts  as opposed to placing their balances in less liquid  term accounts 
total borrowings at december  remained unchanged from the balance at december   while total stockholders equity increased million from december  to december  the increase in total stockholders equity is a result of recording net income of million in the year ended december  coupled with increases in accumulated other comprehensive income and common stock

commercial real estate loan concentration risk real estate loans have historically represented a significant portion of the company s overall loan portfolio and real estate is frequently a material component of collateral for the company s loans 
risks associated with real estate loans include fluctuating land values  demand and prices for housing or commercial properties  national  regional and local economic conditions  changes in tax policies  and concentration within the bank market area 
the following provides information on the company s commercial real estate loan portfolio 
all such lending activities are subject to the varied risks of real estate lending 
the company s loan origination process requires specialized underwriting  collateral and approval procedures  which mitigates  but does not eliminate  the risk that loans may not be repaid 
the million commercial real estate or cre portfolio generally represents loans to finance retail  office and industrial commercial properties 
the expected source of repayment of cre loans is generally the operations of the borrower business  rents or the obligor s personal income 
cre loans represent approximately of total loans outstanding as of december  approximately of cre loans are made to owner occupied users of the commercial property  while of cre loans are to obligors who do not directly occupy the property 
management believes that lending to owner occupied businesses may mitigate  but not eliminate  commercial real estate risk 
however no assurance can be given that residential real estate or other economic factors will not adversely impact the cre portfolio

of total cre of gross loans commercial real estate owner occupied   non owner occupied   lending and credit management the company has a comprehensive risk management process to control  underwrite  monitor and manage credit risk in lending 
the underwriting of loans relies principally on an analysis of an obligor s historical and prospective cash flow augmented by collateral valuation analysis  credit bureau information  as well as business plan assessment 
ongoing loan portfolio monitoring is performed by a centralized credit administration function including review and testing of compliance to loan policies and procedures augmented from time to time with third party credit reviews 
internal and external auditors and bank regulatory examiners periodically sample and test certain credit files as well 
risk of nonpayment exists with respect to all loans  
table of contents which could result in the classification of such loans as non performing 
certain specific types of risks are associated with different types of loans 
reserve for loan losses the reserve for loan losses represents management recognition of the assumed and present risks of extending credit and the possible inability or failure of the obligors to make repayment 
the reserve is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses on loans and unfunded commitments based on management current assessment of a variety of current factors affecting the loan portfolio 
such factors include loss experience  review of problem loans  current economic conditions  and an overall evaluation of the quality  risk characteristics and concentration of loans in the portfolio 
the level of reserve for credit losses is also determined after consideration of bank regulatory guidance and recommendations and is subject to review by regulatory authorities who may require increases to the reserve based on their evaluation of the information available to them at the time of their examination of the bank 
the reserve is based on estimates  and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates 
these estimates are reviewed periodically  and  as adjustments become necessary they are reported in earnings in the periods in which they become known 
the reserve is increased by provisions charged to operations and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
see loan loss provision under consolidated results of operations years ended december    and above in this item during the year ended december   the company revised and continued to enhance its methodology for estimating the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses 
the significant revisions and enhancements to the methodology included the application of historical loss factors by risk rating for each loan segment  as compared to the prior method which utilized blended historical loss factors  a change to historical look back periods  and refinement of the qualitative factors and application thereof used to adjust the estimated historical loss factors 
the reserve for loan losses at december  was significantly affected by the revisions and enhancements to the company s methodology  as well as by the inclusion of charge offs incurred in the bulk sale of certain loans as it relates to its historical loss factors 
a description of the significant revision and enhancements to the methodology for estimating the reserve for loan losses is as follows application of historical loss factors by risk rating for each loan segment and change in look back period  as compared to the prior method which utilized blended quarterly historical loss factors under the previous method  historical loss factors were computed using a rolling quarter basis  then weighted for the most current four quarters  for the next four preceding quarters  and for the final four preceding quarters 
the previous method applied these historical loss factors without regard to risk rating 
under the previous method  each of quarterly look back periods in the model included charge off experience for the preceding quarter 
under the enhanced method  historical loss factors are calculated using a minimum of quarterly look back periods applied by risk rating to each loan segment 
each look back period includes charge off experience by risk rating for each loan segment for the preceding four quarters 
historical loss rates for each period are averaged and multiplied by current loan balances for each risk rating category within loan segments to estimate loss reserve 
in addition  the company made minor refinements to its loan segment groups according to related risk attributes and applied statistical smoothing techniques considered appropriate to the change in method 
refinement of qualitative factors the company refined the qualitative factors used to adjust the historical loss factors by more explicitly detailing the specific qualitative factors to be considered and the determination of the resulting quantitative amounts 
in addition  certain qualitative factors are included in the estimate of total reserve for loan losses to achieve directional consistence and reflect uncertainties such as lack of seasoning in the revised and enhanced model 
at december   management believes that the company s reserve is at an appropriate level under current circumstances and prevailing economic conditions 
however  the total amount of actual loan losses may vary significantly from the estimated amount 
no assurance can be given that in any particular period  the 
table of contents reserve for credit losses will be sufficient  or that loan losses will not be sustained that are sizable in relation to the amount reserved  or that changing economic factors or other environmental conditions will not require increases in the loan loss provision 
the company classifies reserves for unfunded commitments as a liability on its consolidated balance sheet 
such reserves are included as part of the overall reserve for credit losses 
reserves for unfunded commitments totaled approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
allocation of reserve for credit losses allocation of reserves is a function of historical loss factors as applied to rating of loans within each segment of the portfolio 
the higher reserve for loan losses in recent years is attributable to the effect the adverse economy has had on the ability of obligors to repay loans as measured by internal risk rating of various loans 
the unallocated portion of the reserve reflects the level of uncertainty as to the future direction and severity of the economic environment 
prior to december   the level of unallocated reserves included amounts now captured in the current methodology through certain loss factors and qualitative considerations 
allocation exposure percentages for moderated in most categories with improvement in overall risk profile as reflected in improved historical loss rates 
construction lot exposure percentage improved in part due to the reduction of adversely risk rated loans as compared to prior periods 
typical factors leading to changes in reserve allocation include changes in debt service coverage ratios  guarantor and or collateral valuation as well as economic conditions that may have a specific or generalized impact on the relative risks inherent in various loan portfolios 
this allocation process may not accurately predict credit losses by loan type or in the aggregate  however the total reserve for loan losses is available to absorb losses that may arise from any loan type or category

loans placed on nonaccrual status may or may not be contractually past due at the time of such determination  and may or may not be secured 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  it is the bank s policy to reverse  and charge against current income  interest previously accrued but uncollected 
interest subsequently collected on such loans is credited to loan principal if  in the opinion of management  full collectability of principal is doubtful 
interest income that was reversed and charged against income was million in  million in  and million in interest income that would have been recorded in had nonaccrual loans at december  been on accrual status throughout the year would have been million 
during our normal loan review procedures  a loan is considered to be impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or  as a practical expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair market value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
impaired loans are currently measured at lower of cost or fair value 
certain small balance homogeneous loans are collectively measured for impairment 
impaired loans are charged to the allowance when management believes  after considering economic and business conditions  collection efforts and collateral position that the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of principal is not probable 
at december   the company s recorded investment in certain loans that were considered to be impaired was million and specific valuation allowances were million 
impaired loans were million with specific valuation allowances of million at year end

from time to time the company makes commitments to acquire banking properties or to make equipment or technology related investments of capital 
at december   the company had no material capital expenditure commitments apart from those incurred in the ordinary course of business 
liquidity and sources of funds the objective of the bank s liquidity management is to maintain ample cash flows to meet obligations for depositor withdrawals  to fund the borrowing needs of loan customers  and to fund ongoing operations 
at december   liquid assets of the bank are mainly interest bearing balances held at frb totaling million compared to million at december  core relationship deposits are the bank s primary source of funds 
as such  the bank focuses on deposit relationships with local business and consumer clients who maintain multiple accounts and services at the bank 
the company views such deposits as the foundation of its long term liquidity because it believes such core deposits are more stable and less sensitive to changing interest rates and other economic factors compared to large time deposits or wholesale purchased funds 
the bank s customer relationship strategy has resulted in a relatively higher percentage of its deposits being held in checking and money market accounts  and a lesser percentage in time deposits 

table of contents the bank augments core deposits with wholesale funds from time to time 
until the order was terminated on march   the bank was restricted under the terms of the order from accepting or renewing brokered deposits 
at december  and  the company did not have any brokered deposits 
with the recapitalization of the bank in january and its becoming compliant with fdic capital standards  restrictions on its acceptance of public fund deposits were subsequently lifted 
current rules imposed by the oregon state treasury require that the bank collateralize of the uninsured public funds held by the bank 
at december   the bank was in compliance with this statute 
the bank also utilizes borrowings and lines of credit as sources of funds 
at december   the fhlb had extended the bank a secured line of credit of million of total assets accessible for short or long term borrowings given sufficient qualifying collateral 
as of december   the bank had qualifying collateral pledged for fhlb borrowings totaling million of which the bank had utilized million in secured borrowings 
at december   the bank also had undrawn borrowing capacity at frb of approximately million supported by specific qualifying collateral 
borrowing capacity from fhlb or frb may fluctuate based upon the acceptability and risk rating of loan collateral  and counterparties could adjust discount rates applied to such collateral at their discretion 
also  frb or fhlb could restrict or limit our access to secured borrowings 
correspondent banks have extended million in unsecured or collateralized short term lines of credit for the purchase of federal funds 
at december   the company had no outstanding borrowings under these federal fund borrowing agreements 
liquidity may be affected by the bank s routine commitments to extend credit 
at december   the bank had approximately million in outstanding commitments to extend credit  compared to approximately million at year end the increase relates to commitments to extend credit as part of the bank s efforts to grow loans 
at this time  management believes that the bank s available resources will be sufficient to fund its commitments in the normal course of business 
the investment portfolio also provides a secondary source of funds as investments may be pledged for borrowings or sold for cash 
this liquidity is limited  however  by counterparties willingness to accept securities as collateral and the market value of securities at the time of sale could result in a loss to the bank 
as of december   the company held unpledged investments with a book value that totaled million compared to million at december  the order  which remained in effect until it was terminated on march   required the bank to maintain a primary liquidity ratio net cash  plus net short term and marketable assets divided by net deposits and short term liabilities of at least

bancorp is a single bank holding company and its primary ongoing source of liquidity is dividends received from the bank 
oregon banking laws impose certain limitations on the payment of dividends by oregon state chartered banks 
the amount of the dividend may not be greater than the bank s unreserved retained earnings  deducting from that  to the extent not already charged against earnings or reflected in a reserve  the following all bad debts  which are debts on which interest is past due and unpaid for at least six months  unless the debt is fully secured and in the process of collection  all other assets charged off as required by the director of the department of consumer and business services or a state or federal examiner  and all accrued expenses  interest and taxes of the institution 
the bank received regulatory approval to adjust retained earnings to zero at september  accordingly  bank payment of dividends is constrained by the amount of increases in retained earnings from that date 
in addition  pursuant to its memorandum of understanding with its regulators  as was the case under the order before it was terminated on march   the bank is required to seek permission from its regulators prior to payment of cash dividends 
per the written agreement  bancorp must receive permission from its regulators prior to taking dividends from the bank additional information regarding limits on the payment of dividends may be found throughout item of this report  including under the headings supervision and regulation and regulations concerning cash dividends  in item of this report and in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report

the key ratios described above should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the company and related notes thereto and management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included elsewhere in this report 
inflation the effect of changing prices on financial institutions is typically different than on non banking companies since a substantial portion of a bank assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
in particular  interest rates are significantly affected by inflation  but neither the timing nor magnitude of the changes to interest rates can be directly correlated to price level indices  therefore  the company can best counter inflation over the long term by managing sensitivity to interest rates of its net interest income and controlling levels of non interest income and expenses
