as previously disclosed in the company s form k for the year ended july   in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company completed a review of all operating units and expected to reduce annual cash expenditures by million in fiscal based on actions completed by september  which included  among other items  a realignment of our workforce  final integration of the acquired businesses at life sciences  rationalization of low margin products  a refocus of our research and development program toward higher value diagnostic platforms and the reduction in outside consulting costs 
for the year ended july   the company realized the aforementioned cost reductions in annual expenditures however  such reductions were partially offset by higher than expected legal costs of approximately million relating to patent litigation matters 
the company will continue to review all operating units and expects to further reduce annual operating expenditures in fiscal while revenues at the life sciences has continued to decline the operating results have improved  although there can be no assurance that life sciences will be able to sustain these results and if not  it may be required to record an impairment of intangibles and long lived assets 
despite the challenging global economic environment  declining revenues in the life sciences reporting unit in fiscal attributed to macroeconomic concerns and customer research budgets  impacts of healthcare reform regulations and changes in payer policies affecting reimbursements to providers and the funding of research projects  the company believes that its current cash and cash equivalents level  utilization of the controlled equity offering program disclosed in note  which has resulted in net proceeds of million subsequent to july   and available borrowings under the aforementioned revolving loan and security agreement disclosed in note are sufficient for its foreseeable liquidity and capital resource needs over the next twelve months  although there can be no assurance that future events will not alter such view 
although there can be no assurances  in the event additional capital is required  the company believes it has the ability to raise additional funds through equity offerings or other sources of funds 
our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including those described in the item a 
risk factors section of this form k for the year ended july   some of which are outside our control 
macroeconomic conditions could limit our ability to successfully execute our business plans and therefore adversely affect our liquidity plans 
see in this form k for the fiscal year ended july  part item business  for forward looking cautionary statements 
effect of new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income asu no 
 which requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
asu eliminated the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of stockholders equity 
the company adopted asu in its first quarter of fiscal year by including the required disclosures in two separate but consecutive statements 
in september  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
testing goodwill for impairment asu no 
which is intended to reduce the complexity and costs to test goodwill for impairment 
the amendment allows an entity the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
an entity will no longer be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on its qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
the asu also expands upon the examples of events and circumstances that an entity should consider between annual impairment tests in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
the amendment became effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for the company s fiscal year beginning august  the company adopted asu in the first quarter of fiscal and adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued asu no 
health care entities topic presentation and disclosure of patient service revenue  provision for bad debts  and the allowance for doubtful accounts for certain health care entities 
this update was issued to provide greater transparency relating to accounting practices used for net patient service revenue and related bad debt allowances by health care entities 
some health care entities recognize patient service revenue at the time the services are rendered regardless of whether the entity expects to collect that amount or has assessed the patient s ability to pay 
these prior accounting practices used by some health care entities resulted in a gross up of patient service revenue and the provision for bad debts  causing difficulty for users of financial statements to make accurate comparisons and analyses of financial statements among entities 
asu no 
requires certain healthcare entities to change the presentation of the statement of operations  reclassifying the provision for bad debts associated with patient service revenue from an operating expense to a deduction from patient service revenue and also requires enhanced quantitative and qualitative disclosures relevant to the entity s policies for recognizing revenue and assessing bad debts 
this update is not designed to change and will not change the net income reported by healthcare entities 
the company adopted this update in its first quarter of fiscal year with no impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment asu  which permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit s indefinite lived intangible asset is less than the asset s carrying value before applying the two step goodwill impairment model that is currently in place 
if it is determined through the qualitative assessment that the fair value of a reporting unit s indefinite lived intangible asset is more likely than not greater than the asset s carrying value  the remaining impairment steps would be unnecessary 
the qualitative assessment is optional  allowing companies to go directly to the quantitative assessment 
asu is effective for the company for annual and interim indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests performed beginning august   however early adoption is permitted 
the company is currently evaluating the impact asu will have on its consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the company has entered into various real estate and equipment operating leases and has employment agreements with certain executive officers 
the real estate lease for the company s farmingdale clinical lab and research facility is with a related party 
see item  properties  and note to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of these various leases 
the following is a summary of future payments under the company s contractual obligations as of july  payments due by period in s total less than year years years more than years current and long term debt obligations   capital lease obligations operating lease obligations    employment agreements    total      management is not aware of any material claims  disputes or settled matters concerning third party reimbursements that would have a material effect on our financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements as such term is defined in item a of regulation s k 
critical accounting policies general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon enzo biochem  inc consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and judgments also affect related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to contractual expense  allowance for uncollectible accounts  inventory  intangible assets and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
product revenues revenues from product sales are recognized when the products are shipped and title transfers  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
royalties royalty revenues are recorded in the period earned 
royalties received in advance of being earned are recorded as deferred revenues 
revenues clinical laboratory services revenues from the clinical labs segment are recognized upon completion of the testing process for a specific patient and reported to the ordering physician 
these revenues and the associated accounts receivable are based on gross amounts billed or billable for services rendered  net of a contractual adjustment  which is the difference between amounts billed to payers and the expected approved reimbursable settlements from such payers 
the following table represents the clinical labs segment s net revenues and percentages by revenue category year ended july year ended july year ended july revenue category in s in in s in in s in medicare    third party payers   patient self pay    hmo s    total    the company provides services to certain patients covered by various third party payers  including the federal medicare program 
laws and regulations governing medicare are complex and subject to interpretation for which action for noncompliance includes fines  penalties and exclusion from the medicare programs 
see item legal proceedings 
other than the medicare program  one provider whose programs are included in the third party payers and health maintenance organizations hmo s categories represent approximately  and of the clinical labs segment net revenue for the years ended july   and respectively 
another third party provider represents  and of the clinical labs segment s net revenue for the years ended july   and  respectively 
contractual adjustment the company s estimate of contractual adjustment is based on significant assumptions and judgments  such as its interpretation of payer reimbursement policies  and bears the risk of change 
the estimation process is based on the experience of amounts approved as reimbursable and ultimately settled by payers  versus the corresponding gross amount billed to the respective payers 
the contractual adjustment is an estimate that reduces gross revenue based on gross billing rates  to amounts expected to be approved and reimbursed 
gross billings are based on a standard fee schedule we set for all third party payers  including medicare  health maintenance organizations hmo s and managed care 
the company adjusts the contractual adjustment estimate quarterly  based on its evaluation of current and historical settlement experience with payers  industry reimbursement trends  and other relevant factors 
the other relevant factors that affect our contractual adjustment include the monthly and quarterly review of current gross billings and receivables and reimbursement by payer  current changes in third party arrangements and the growth of in network provider arrangements and managed care plans specific to our company 
our clinical laboratory business is primarily dependent upon reimbursement from third party payers  such as medicare which principally serves patients and older and insurers 
we are subject to variances in reimbursement rates among different third party payers  as well as constant changes of reimbursement rates 
changes that decrease reimbursement rates or coverage would negatively impact our revenues 
the number of individuals covered under managed care contracts or other similar arrangements has grown over the past several years and may continue to grow in the future 
in addition  medicare and other government healthcare programs continue to shift to managed care 
these trends will continue to reduce our revenues 
during the years ended july   and  the contractual adjustment percentages  determined using current and historical reimbursement statistics  were approximately  and  respectively  of gross billings 
the company believes a decline in reimbursement rates or a shift to managed care  or similar arrangements may be offset by the positive impact of an increase in the number of tests we perform 
however  there can be no assurance that we can increase the number of tests we perform or that if we do increase the number of tests we perform  that we can maintain that higher number of tests performed  or that an increase in the number of tests we perform would result in increased revenue 
the company estimates by using a sensitivity analysis that each point change in the contractual adjustment percentage could result in a change in clinical laboratory services revenues of approximately million  million  and million  for the years ended july    and  respectively  and a change in the net accounts receivable of approximately million and million as of july  and  respectively 
our clinical laboratory financial billing system records gross billings using a standard fee schedule for all payers and does not record contractual adjustment by payer at the time of billing 
therefore  we are unable to quantify the effect of contractual adjustment recorded during the current period that relate to revenue recorded in a previous period 
however  we can reasonably estimate our monthly contractual adjustment to revenue on a timely basis based on our quarterly review process  which includes an analysis of industry reimbursement trends  an evaluation of third party reimbursement rates changes and changes in reimbursement arrangements with third party payers  a rolling monthly analysis of current and historical claim settlement and reimbursement experience statistics with payers  an analysis of current gross billings and receivables by payer 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reported at realizable value  net of allowances for doubtful accounts  which is estimated and recorded in the period of the related revenue 
the following is a table of the company s net accounts receivable by segment 
the clinical labs segment s net receivables are detailed by billing category and as a percent to its total net receivables 
as of july  and  approximately and  respectively  of the company s net accounts receivable relates to its clinical labs business  which operates in the new york  new jersey and eastern pennsylvania medical communities 
the life sciences segment s accounts receivable  of which million or and million or represents foreign receivables as of july  and respectively  includes royalty receivables of million and million  respectively  from qiagen corporation 
net accounts receivable july  july  in s in in s in clinical labs by billing category medicare  third party payers   patient self pay   hmo s total clinical labs   total life sciences   total accounts receivable net   changes in the company s allowance for doubtful accounts are as follows in s july  july  beginning balance   provision for doubtful accounts   write offs  net   ending balance   for the clinical labs segment  the allowance for doubtful accounts represents amounts that the company does not expect to collect after the company has exhausted its collection procedures 
the company estimates its allowance for doubtful accounts in the period the related services are billed and adjusts the estimate in future accounting periods as necessary 
it bases the estimate for the allowance on the evaluation of historical collection experience  the aging profile of accounts receivable  the historical doubtful account write off percentages  payer mix  and other relevant factors 
the allowance for doubtful accounts includes the balances  after receipt of the approved settlements from third party payers  for the insufficient diagnosis information received from the ordering physician which result in denials of payment  and the uncollectible portion of receivables from self payers  including deductibles and copayments  which are subject to credit risk and patients ability to pay 
during the years ended july  and  the company determined an allowance for doubtful accounts for customers whose accounts receivable have been oustanding less than days and wrote off of accounts receivable over days  as it assumed those accounts are uncollectible  except for certain fully reserved balances  principally related to medicare 
these accounts have not been written off because the payer s filing date deadline has not occurred or the collection process has not been exhausted 
the company s collection experience on medicare receivables beyond days has been insignificant 
the company adjusts the historical collection analysis for recoveries  if any  on an ongoing basis 
the company s ability to collect outstanding receivables from third party payers is critical to its operating performance and cash flows 
the primary collection risk lies with uninsured patients or patients for whom primary insurance has paid but a patient portion remains outstanding 
the company also assesses the current state of its billing functions in order to identify any known collection or reimbursement issues in order to assess the impact  if any  on the allowance estimates  which involves judgment 
the company believes that the collectability of its receivables is directly linked to the quality of its billing processes  most notably  those related to obtaining the accurate patient information in order to bill effectively for the services provided 
should circumstances change eg shift in payer mix  decline in economic conditions or deterioration in aging of receivables  our estimates of net realizable value of receivables could be reduced by a material amount 
billing for laboratory services is complicated because of many factors  especially the differences between our standard gross fee schedule for all payers and the reimbursement rates of the various payers we deal with  disparity of coverage and information requirements among the various payers  and disputes with payers as to which party is responsible for reimbursement

under the liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
the liability method requires that any tax benefits recognized for net operating loss carry forwards and other items be reduced by a valuation allowance where it is not more likely than not the benefits will be realized in the foreseeable future 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
under the liability method  the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
it is the company s policy to provide for uncertain tax positions  if any  and the related interest and penalties based upon management s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
to the extent the company prevails in matters for which a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit is established or is required to pay amounts in excess of the liability  the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be affected 
inventory the company values inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
work in process and finished goods inventories consist of material  labor  and manufacturing overhead 
write downs of inventories to market value are based on a review of inventory quantities on hand and estimated sales forecasts based on sales history and anticipated future demand 
unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and require additional write downs of inventory which would impact our results of operations 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
the company tests goodwill and had tested other indefinite lived intangibles for impairment annually as of the first day of the fourth quarter  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test requires the identification of the reporting units and comparison of the fair value of each of these reporting units to their respective carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit is less than its fair value  no impairment exists and the second step is not performed 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value  the second step must be performed to compute the amount of the goodwill impairment  if any 
in the second step  the impairment is computed by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized for the excess 
in the fiscal fourth quarter the company recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge relating to the life sciences reporting unit of million after completing an interim impairment assessment as of july  the interim impairment test as of july  was required due to a decline in market capitalization of from may to july  and declining revenues experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal in connection with the annual assessment of indefinite lived intangibles as of may   the company determined the estimated fair value of trademarks  relating to the enzo life sciences reporting unit  were less than their carrying values by million primarily due to declines in projected revenues and in connection with future plans resulting from a strategic review 
as a result of this impairment  which included a change in the future branding strategy  the useful life of the trademarks were reassessed and determined to have an estimated economic life of years 
a non cash impairment charge of million  million net of related taxes was recorded for the trademark impairment in the fourth quarter 
as a result of the reclassification of trademarks from indefinite lived to a year life  annual amortization of trademarks is estimated to be million per year 
intangible assets intangible assets exclusive of patents  arose primarily from acquisitions and primarily consist of customer relationships  trademarks  licenses  employment and non compete agreements  and website and database content 
these finite lived intangible assets are amortized according to their estimated useful lives  which range from to years 
the company had previously capitalized certain legal costs directly incurred in pursuing patent applications as patent costs 
when such applications result in an issued patent  the related costs are amortized over a ten year period or the life of the patent  whichever is shorter  using the straight line method 
the company reviews its issued patents and pending patent applications  and if it determines to abandon a patent application or that an issued patent no longer has economic value  the unamortized balance in deferred patent costs relating to that patent is immediately expensed 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulting from acquisitions with foreign locations see item a 
risk factors and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements that could impact our results of operations and financial position 
we do not currently engage in any hedging or market risk management tools 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the financial reporting of our non us subsidiaries is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
since the functional currency of our non us subsidiaries is the local currency  foreign currency translation adjustments are accumulated as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
assuming a hypothetical decline of in the exchange rates of foreign currencies against the us dollar at july   our assets and liabilities would decrease by million and million  respectively  and our net sales and net earnings loss would decrease by million and million  respectively  on an annual basis 
we also maintain intercompany balances and loans receivable with subsidiaries with different local currencies 
these amounts are at risk of foreign exchange losses if exchange rates fluctuate 
assuming a hypothetical increase of in the exchange rates of foreign currencies against the us dollar at july   our pre tax earnings loss would be unfavorably impacted by approximately million on an annual basis 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk with our variable rate credit agreement which bears interest at the three month libor with a floor of plus per annum 
a change in the libor rate would impact our interest expense by million 
as of july   we have fixed interest rate financing on transportation and equipment leases
