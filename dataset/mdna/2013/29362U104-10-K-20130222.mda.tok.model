overview this overview is not a complete discussion of the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations  it is intended merely to facilitate an understanding of the most salient aspects of its financial condition and operating performance and to provide a context for the detailed discussion and analysis that follows and must be read in its entirety in order to fully understand the company s financial condition and results of operations 
entegris  inc is a leading provider of a wide range of products and services for purifying  protecting and transporting the critical materials used in processing and manufacturing in the microelectronics and other high technology industries 
entegris derives most of its revenue from the sale of products and services to the semiconductor and related industries 
the company s customers consist primarily of semiconductor manufacturers  semiconductor equipment and materials suppliers as well as thin film transistor liquid crystal display tft lcd and hard disk manufacturers  which are served through direct sales efforts  as well as sales and distribution relationships  in the united states  asia  europe and the middle east 

table of contents the company offers a diverse product portfolio which includes more than  standard and customized products that it believes provide the most comprehensive offering of contamination control solutions and microenvironment products and services to maintain the purity and integrity of critical materials used by the semiconductor and other high technology industries 
certain of these products are unit driven and consumable products that rely on the level of semiconductor manufacturing activity to drive growth  while others are capital expenditure driven and rely on expansion of manufacturing capacity to drive growth 
the company s unit driven and consumable products includes membrane based liquid filters and housings  metal based gas filters  resin based gas purifiers  wafer shippers  disk shipping containers and test assembly and packaging products and consumable graphite and silicon carbide components used in plasma etch  ion implant and chemical vapor deposition processes in semiconductor manufacturing 
the company s capital expense driven products include components  systems and subsystems that use electro mechanical  pressure differential and related technologies to permit semiconductor and other electronics manufacturers to monitor and control the flow and condition of process liquids used in these manufacturing processes  and process carriers that protect the integrity of in process wafers 
key operating factors key factors  which management believes have the largest impact on the overall results of operations of entegris  inc  include level of sales since a significant portion of the company s product costs except for raw materials  purchased components and direct labor are largely fixed in the short to medium term  an increase or decrease in sales affects gross profits and overall profitability significantly 
also  increases or decreases in sales and operating profitability affect certain costs such as incentive compensation and commissions  which are highly variable in nature 
the company s sales are subject to the effects of industry cyclicality  technological change  substantial competition  pricing pressures and foreign currency fluctuation 
variable margin on sales the company s variable margin on sales is determined by selling prices and the costs of manufacturing and raw materials 
this is affected by a number of factors  which include the company s sales mix  purchase prices of raw material especially polymers  stainless steel and purchased components  competition  both domestic and international  direct labor costs  and the efficiency of the company s production operations  among others 
fixed cost structure 
the company s operations include a number of large fixed or semi fixed cost components  which include salaries  indirect labor and benefits  facility costs  lease expense  and depreciation and amortization 
it is not possible to vary these costs easily in the short term as volumes fluctuate 
accordingly  increases or decreases in sales volume can have a large effect on the usage and productivity of these cost components  resulting in a large impact on the company s profitability 
overall summary of financial results for the year ended december  the company s financial results for reflected the lower capital spending levels and sluggish production rates in the semiconductor industry that began in the latter half of total net sales for the year ended december  were million  down million  or  from sales of million for the year ended december  sales in showed modest quarterly growth from late levels before declining in the latter half of the year 
the sales decrease in included unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of million related to the year over year weakening of most international currencies versus the us dollar  most notably the euro 
excluding this factor  net sales fell approximately in when compared to the year over year sales decrease  along with a slightly unfavorable sales mix  accounted for lower gross profits in these factors  along with lower levels of factory utilization  underlie the gross margin rate for of compared to a year ago 

table of contents operating costs  consisting of selling  general and administrative sg a and engineering  research and development er d costs  increased for the year ended december  when compared to the year ago period 
included in sg a for the year ended december  was a million charge associated with a ceo succession and transition plan 
the company s effective tax rate was in compared to in tax expense in included a million benefit associated with a decrease in the company s us deferred tax asset valuation allowance  primarily accounting for the year to year increase in the effective tax rate 
as a result of the aforementioned factors  net income attributable to the company for was million  or per diluted share  compared to net income attributable to the company of million  or per diluted share  in during  the company s operating activities provided cash flow of million 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december  compared with million at december  the company had no outstanding short term bank borrowings or long term debt at december  critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
at each balance sheet date  management evaluates its estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to accounts receivable  sales return obligations  inventories  long lived assets  income taxes and shared based compensation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates  this could result in material differences in the amount and timing of the company s results of operations for any period 
in addition  actual results could be different from the company s current estimates  possibly resulting in increased future charges to earnings 
the critical accounting policies affected most significantly by estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are discussed below 
accounts receivable related valuation accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts and for sales returns and allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing these valuation accounts 
the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts for all individual receivables judged to be unlikely for collection 
in addition  for all other accounts receivable  the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors 
specifically  management considers the age of receivable balances  historical bad debt write off experience and current economic circumstances 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase in primarily reflects the recording of allowances for specific individual receivables 
an allowance for sales returns and allowances is established based on historical and current trends in both sales and product returns 
at december  and  the company s reserve for sales returns and allowances was million and million  respectively 
the increase in primarily reflects changes in the underlying variables of the company s determination of its sales return allowances 

table of contents inventory valuation the company uses certain estimates and judgments to properly value its inventory 
in general  the company s inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market 
the company evaluates its ending inventories for obsolescence and excess quantities each quarter 
this evaluation includes analyses of inventory levels  historical write off trends  expected product lives  and historical and projected sales levels by product 
inventories that are considered obsolete are written off or a full allowance is recorded 
in addition  allowances are established for inventory quantities in excess of forecasted demand 
inventory allowances were million at both december  and the company s inventories include materials and products subject to technological obsolescence  which are sold in highly competitive industries 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than current conditions or the company s projected outlook for sales  inventory write downs or additional allowances may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
impairment of long lived assets as of december   the company had million of net property  plant and equipment and million of net intangible assets 
the company routinely considers whether indicators of impairment of the value of its long lived assets  particularly its manufacturing equipment  and its intangible assets  are present 
a long lived asset asset group shall be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances triggering events indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the following are examples of such events or changes in circumstances a 
a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset asset group b 
a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset asset group is being used or in its physical condition c 
a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset asset group  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator d 
an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset asset group e 
a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset asset group f 
a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
if such indicators are present  it is determined whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the asset group in question is less than its carrying value 
if less  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its respective fair value 
fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows  appraisals or other methods deemed appropriate 
if the asset groups determined to be impaired are to be held and used  the company recognizes an impairment charge to the extent the fair value attributable to the asset group is less than the assets carrying value 
the fair value of the assets then becomes the assets new carrying value  which is depreciated or amortized over the remaining estimated useful life of the assets 
the company s long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level asset groups for which the identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
the company has four significant asset groups  identified by assessing the company s identifiable cash flows and the interdependence of such cash flows contamination control solutions ccs  microenvironments me  poco graphite poco and entegris specialty coatings esc 
as described above  the evaluation of the recoverability of long lived assets requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to  the identification of the asset group at the lowest level of independent cash flows  the primary asset of the group 
table of contents and long range forecasts of revenue and costs  reflecting management s assessment of general economic and industry conditions  operating income  depreciation and amortization and working capital requirements 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates  actual results could differ from those estimates 
in addition  changes in the underlying assumptions would have a significant impact on the conclusion that an asset group s carrying value is recoverable  or the determination of any impairment charge if it was determined that the asset values were indeed impaired 
based on current general economic conditions and trends within the semiconductor industry and the absence of any other triggering events  the company has not been required to perform impairment testing for any of its asset groups since the company will continue to monitor circumstances and events to determine whether asset impairment testing is warranted 
it is possible that in the future the company may no longer be able to conclude that there is no impairment of its long lived assets  nor can the company provide assurance that material impairment charges of long lived assets will not occur in future periods 
income taxes in the preparation of the company s financial statements  the income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid 
the company is subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining consolidated income tax expense 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements  which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future 
in evaluating the company s ability to recover its deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise  management considers all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and results of recent operations 
in projecting future taxable income  the company begins with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporates assumptions about the amount of future state  federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences 
the assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates management is using to manage the underlying business 
in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide  the company considers three years of cumulative operating income loss 
the company has deferred tax assets related to certain federal and state credit carryforwards  and certain state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
management believes it is more likely than not that the benefit from a portion of these carryforwards will not be realized 
in recognition of this risk  the company provided a valuation allowance of million and million as of december  and december   respectively  relating to these carryforwards 
if the company s assumptions change and it determines it will be able to realize these carryforwards  the tax benefits relating to any reversal of the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets will be recognized as a reduction of income tax expense 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  on the basis of the technical merits 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and operating results 
share based compensation u 
s generally accepted accounting principles require the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
the company estimates the value of stock option and restricted stock awards on the date of grant 

table of contents the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards is valued based on the company s stock price on the date of grant 
the fair value of stock option awards is estimated on the date of grant using an option pricing model affected by the company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include the expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards  risk free interest rate and dividend yield assumptions  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors and forfeitures 
because share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it is recorded net of estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience and current expectations 
if the above factors change  and the company uses different assumptions in future periods  the share based compensation expense recorded may differ significantly from what was recorded in the current period 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table sets forth the results of operations and the relationship between various components of operations  stated as a percent of net sales  for the years ended december  and the company s historical financial data was derived from its consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report

the company s operating segments experienced mixed sales results 
see the segment analysis included below in this section for additional detail 
the sales decrease in included unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of million related to the year over year weakening of most international currencies versus the us dollar  most notably the euro 
excluding this factor  net sales fell approximately in when compared to 
table of contents on a geographic basis  total sales to north america were  asia pacific  europe and japan in total sales to north america were  asia pacific  europe and japan in when comparing to  all regions experienced year over year sales decreases except north america 
net sales to customers in asia  europe  and japan decreased   and  respectively  and north america increased from to net sales for asia and europe were affected by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of million and million  respectively 
net of those effects  sales decreased and for asia and europe  respectively 
demand drivers for the company s business primarily consist of semiconductor fab utilization and production unit driven as well as capital spending for new or upgraded semiconductor fabrication equipment and facilities capital driven 
the company analyzes sales of its products by these two key drivers 
sales of unit driven products represented of total sales and sales of capital driven products represented of total sales in this compares to a unit driven to capital driven ratio of for this shift in relative demand for capital driven products reflects lower capital spending since mid by semiconductor customers for capacity related products 
sales of unit driven products increased in unit driven products generally have average lives of less than months or need to be replaced based on usage levels 
these products include liquid filters used in the photolithography  cmp and wet etch and clean processes  specialized graphite components  and wafer shippers used to ship raw wafers  particularly at wafer sizes of mm and below 
year over year sales of capital driven products decreased in capital driven products include wafer process carriers  gas microcontamination control systems used in the deployment of advanced photolithography processes  fluid handling systems  including dispense pumps used in the photolithography process  and integrated liquid flow controllers used in various processes around the fab 
the company believes the sales decreases noted above are primarily volume driven 
based on the information available  the company believes it improved or maintained market share for its products and that the effect of selling price erosion was nominal 
additionally  given that no single customer accounts for more than of the company s annual revenue  the decrease in sales has not been driven by any one particular customer or group of customers  but rather by the decline in semiconductor and other high technology sectors as a whole 
gross profit gross profit for decreased by million  to million  a decrease of from million for the gross margin rate for was versus for the year over year sales decrease accounted for the company s lower gross profit in the reduction in gross profit related to a slightly unfavorable sales mix was offset by improved levels of factory utilization  primarily at the company s microenvironments segment  and higher royalty revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for increased million  or  to million from million in sg a expenses  as a percent of net sales  increased to from a year earlier  reflecting both the decrease in net sales and increase in sg a expenditure levels 
the increase in sg a expenses includes a million charge associated with compensation to which the company s former chief executive officer was entitled in connection with a succession and transition plan  a million increase in consultants fees  and a million increase in the provision for bad debts 
other employee costs  which make up about two thirds of sg a expenses  were flat as lower accruals for incentive compensation were offset by increases in other employee cost categories  most notably benefit costs 
the increase in sg a costs was partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation effects of million 
included in the twelve month period ended december  was a million gain associated with the pension curtailment of the company s japan defined benefit pension plan

table of contents engineering  research and development expenses engineering  research and development er d expenses related to the support of current product lines and the development of new products and manufacturing technologies increased by million  or  to million in compared to million in er d expenses as a percent of net sales were compared to a year ago  reflecting both the increase in er d expenditure levels and decrease in net sales 
the increase in er d expense mainly reflects higher employee costs million and a general increase in overall er d expense levels related to the support of current product lines and the development of new products and manufacturing technologies 
moving into  the company intends to invest in its core membrane and coatings technologies to continue to create differentiated and high value  unit driven products for the most advanced and demanding semiconductor applications 
in addition  the company is committed to the er d spending and capital investment needed to sustain its initiative in mm wafer handling as that technology is adopted over the next several years 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets was million in compared to million for the decline reflects the absence of amortization expense for certain acquired developed technology and trade name assets that became fully amortized in or other income  net other income was million in compared to other income of million in in  other income includes a million gain recorded in the second quarter related to the remeasurement of the previously held equity investment in a taiwan joint venture entity in which the company acquired a interest in april the other income was partially offset by million of foreign currency transaction losses related to the remeasurement of yen denominated assets and liabilities held by the company 
in  other income primarily relates to a million gain recorded in connection with the sale of an equity investment 
income tax expense the company recorded income tax expense of million in compared to an income tax expense of million in the company s effective tax rate was in  compared to in in  the company s effective tax rate was lower than the us statutory rate of primarily due to lower rates in various foreign jurisdictions compared to the us statutory rate 
in  the company s effective tax rate was lower than the us statutory rate of due mainly to the million reduction of tax expense related to the decrease in the company s deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
management concluded it is more likely than not that the company would realize the us net deferred tax assets and thereby released the valuation allowance on most of its us deferred tax assets 
the million of benefit to tax expense comprises million from the us utilization of deferred tax assets during the year  million from the utilization of foreign deferred tax assets and million attributed to the release of the valuation allowance at december  equity in net income of affiliates the company recorded equity in the net income of affiliates of thousand in compared to equity in the net income of affiliates of million in during  the company acquired the remaining of entegris precision technologies corporation ept in taiwan  an entity in which it had previously owned a equity interest accounted for under the equity method 
net income attributable to entegris  inc net income attributable to the company was million  or per diluted share  in compared to net income attributable to the company of million  or per diluted share  in the decrease mainly reflects the company s lower net sales and related gross profit decrease  slightly increased operating expenses and higher income tax expense  each described in greater detail above

net of unfavorable foreign currency effects of million  ccs net sales fell 
ccs sales decreased due to lower sales of products tied to semiconductor industry capital spending  which experienced a sharp drop in the second half of sales of both fluid components and systems products  and gas filtration products fell in sales of liquid filtration products  which are less affected by capital spending levels  improved due to strong initial acceptance and demand for new products supporting advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes 
ccs reported a segment profit of million for the year ended december  compared to million in the comparable period last year  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in sales volume directly led to the decline in gross profit of million 
operating expenses increased  with selling and marketing expenses  and engineering  research and development costs related to the support of current product lines and the development of new and high value  unit driven products for the most advanced and demanding semiconductor applications increasing by million and million  respectively 
those factors account for the year over year change in the ccs s profitability 
microenvironments me for the year ended december   me net sales remained flat at million  versus million in the comparable period last year

the company believes the non gaap measures aid investors overall understanding of the company s results by providing a higher degree of transparency for such items and providing a level of disclosure that will help investors understand how management plans  measures and evaluates the company s business performance 
management believes that the inclusion of non gaap measures provides consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors understanding of the company s historical operating trends by providing an additional basis for comparisons to prior periods
