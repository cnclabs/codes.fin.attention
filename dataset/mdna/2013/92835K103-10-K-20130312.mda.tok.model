item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cost management related to our restructuring efforts 
sources of supplies although most materials incorporated in our products are available from a number of sources  certain materials are available only from a relatively limited number of suppliers 
the principal materials used in our products include various metallic foil alloys  aluminum  stainless steel  tool steel  plastics  and for a few products  gold 
some of the most highly specialized materials for our sensors are sourced from a single vendor 
we maintain a safety stock inventory of certain critical materials at our facilities 
our products do not contain significant amounts of precious metals 
we do not purchase any rare earth metals or tantalum 
due to our vertical integration structure  our force sensors and weighing and control systems segment products are based principally on strain gages produced by our foil technology products segment 
israeli government incentives we have substantial manufacturing operations in israel  where we benefit from the government s tax incentive programs 
these benefits take the form of reduced tax rates that are lower than those in the united states 
inventory and backlog we manufacture both standardized products and those designed and produced to meet customer specifications 
we maintain an inventory of standardized components  and monitor the backlog of outstanding orders for our products 
we include in our backlog only open orders that have been released by the customer for shipment in the next twelve months 
many of our customers for strain gages  load cells  and foil resistors encounter uncertain and changing demand for their products 
they typically order products from us based on their forecasts 
if demand falls below customers forecasts  or if customers do not control their inventory effectively  they may cancel or reschedule the shipments that are included in our backlog  in many instances without the payment of any penalty 
therefore  the backlog at any point in time is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods 
customers and marketing our customer base is diversified in terms of industry  geographic region  and range of product needs 
no single customer accounts for more than of our net revenues 
the vast majority of our products are used in the broad industrial market  with selected uses in the military aerospace  medical  agricultural  and construction sectors 
within the broad industrial market  our products serve a wide variety of applications in waste management  bulk hauling  logging  scales manufacturing  engineering systems  pharmaceutical  oil  chemical  steel  paper  and food industries 
our sales are global  with approximately of our net revenues attributable to customers in the americas  approximately of our revenues attributable to customers in europe  and approximately of our revenues attributable to customers in asia for the fiscal year ended december  we sell through a variety of sales channels  including oems  electronic manufacturing services companies ems which manufacture for oems on an outsourcing basis  independent distributors  and we sell directly to end use customers 
during  sales channels for our three reporting segments were as follows foil weighing technology force and control products sensors systems oems ems distributors end users many of our products have historically been sold by dedicated sales forces consisting mainly of faes focusing on specific market segments or specific customers 
the faes help identify the products in our portfolio that best meet the needs of our customers and provide technical and applications support 
their in depth knowledge of customer needs is a key factor in new product design and future research and development initiatives 
competition our competitive success depends on our ability to maintain a competitive advantage on the basis of superior product capability and performance  product quality  know how  proprietary data  market knowledge  service capability  and business reputation 
price competitiveness can be an important factor  especially within our force sensors segment 
our sales and marketing programs offer our customers a broad range of world class precision technologies  and superior global sales and support 
competition in the markets where we sell the bulk of our products is extremely fragmented  both geographically and by application 
to our knowledge  there are no competitors with the same product mix and proprietary technology as ours 
our competitors range from very small  local companies to large  international companies with greater financial resources than us 
our foil resistors and our foil strain gages  where we maintain a leading market share  are based on our proprietary technology 
competitors often compete in this area with functionally equivalent but alternative products 
research and development many of our products  manufacturing techniques  and technologies have been invented  designed  and developed by our engineers and scientists 
special proprietary resistive metallic foil is the most important material in both our foil resistors and our foil strain gages  and our research and development activities related to foil materials is an important linkage between these two products 
we maintain strategically placed design centers where proximity to customers enables us to more easily monitor and satisfy the needs of local markets 
these design centers are located in israel  the united states  sweden  japan  the united kingdom  india  the people s republic of china  the republic of china taiwan  germany and france 
with the acquisition of kelk in january  we have added additional research and development capabilities in canada 
we also maintain research and development staff and promote programs at a number of our production facilities to develop new products and new applications of existing products  and to improve manufacturing techniques 
this decentralized system encourages individualized product development at specific manufacturing facilities that occasionally has applications at other facilities 
our research and development staff and our sales force are closely linked 
our sales force is comprised of individuals with an engineering background who can help meet the needs of our customers for technical and applications support 
this in depth knowledge of customer needs and specifications is a key factor in future research and development initiatives 
research and development will continue to play a key role in our efforts to introduce innovative products for new sales and to improve profitability 
we expect to continue to expand our position as a leading supplier of precision foil technology products 
we believe our r d efforts should provide us with a variety of opportunities to leverage technology  products  and our manufacturing base and  ultimately  our financial performance 
to that end  we expect to increase our r d expenditures in order to fill the product development pipeline and lay the foundation for future sales growth 
patents and licenses we have made a significant investment in securing intellectual property protection for our technology and products 
we seek to protect our technology by  among other things  filing patent applications for technology considered important to the development of our business 
although we have numerous united states and foreign patents covering certain of our products and manufacturing processes  no particular patent is considered individually material to our business 
we also rely upon trade secrets  unpatented know how  and continuing technological innovation 
our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends  in part  on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology 
although we have been awarded  have filed applications for  or have obtained numerous patents in the united states and other countries  there can be no assurance concerning the degree of protection afforded by these patents or the likelihood that pending patents will be issued 
we require all of our technical  research and development  sales and marketing  and management employees and most consultants and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us 
these agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the entity or individual during the course of the entity s or individual s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances 
substantially all of our technical  research and development  sales and marketing  and management employees have entered into agreements providing for the assignment to us of rights to inventions made by them while employed by us 
environmental  health and safety we have an environmental  health and safety policy that commits us to achieve and maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws  to promote proper management of hazardous materials for the safety of our employees and the protection of the environment  and to minimize the hazardous materials generated in the course of our operations 
this policy includes accountability to the board of directors 
in addition  our manufacturing operations are subject to various federal  state  and local laws restricting discharge of materials into the environment 
we are not involved in any pending or threatened proceedings that would require curtailment of our operations 
we continually expend funds to ensure that our facilities comply with applicable environmental regulations 
while we believe that we are in compliance with applicable environmental laws  we cannot accurately predict future developments and do not necessarily have knowledge of all past occurrences on sites that we currently occupy 
more stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future  and we cannot determine the modifications  if any  in our operations that any such future regulations might require  or the cost of compliance with such regulations 
moreover  the risk of environmental liability and remediation costs is inherent in the nature of our business and  therefore  there can be no assurance that material environmental costs  including remediation costs  will not arise in the future 
employees as of december   we employed approximately  full time employees  of whom approximately were located outside the united states 
our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and administrative personnel 
some of our employees outside the united states are members of trade unions 
our relationship with our employees is generally good 
however  no assurance can be given that labor unrest or strikes will not occur

risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this form k in evaluating our company and common stock 
any of the following risks  as well as additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial  could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition and could also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
risks related to our business we face intense competition in our business 
we face various degrees and types of competition in our different businesses 
in some cases our products compete directly with those of third party competitors 
in other cases  competition at one business  such as for our weighing and control systems segment  may affect the sales of our products that we incorporate in those systems from other segments  such as load cells and strain gages 
we have a significant market position in foil resistors and foil strain gages 
foil resistors and foil strain gages are also produced by competitors  principally located in china 
we believe that our foil technology products provide superior performance relative to our competitors  but that could change if our competitors succeed in developing and introducing innovative competitive offerings 
also  our foil strain gages compete with other types of strain gages  such as semiconductor strain gages  which we do not manufacture 
we believe that other types of strain gages are not as reliable or stable as our foil strain gages  but that could change as the technology for these other products continues to evolve 
the ability of these competitors to improve the competitiveness or pricing of their products relative to our offering could adversely affect us 
the market for transducer load cell products is highly fragmented and very competitive 
our load cell modules and systems face competition from numerous other load cell module and systems manufacturers 
competition for modules and systems is most often based on customer relationships  product reliability  technical performance  and the ability to anticipate and satisfy customer needs for specific design configurations 
many other manufacturers have more experience in particular geographic markets and specific applications than we do  and may be better positioned to compete in these areas 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully grow our business in the face of these competitive challenges 
our vertical product integration exposes us to certain risks 
our business organization is focused on vertical product integration 
for example  we use our strain gages in our force sensor products and our force sensor business is our largest customer by volume for our strain gages 
our weighing and control systems business primarily uses our force sensor products in its systems 
we also sell our strain gages and force sensor products to third party customers 
many of the acquisitions which form the core operations of our business in recent years  including our recent acquisition of the kelk business  have been directed towards furthering our vertical integration organization 
while we believe this has been and will continue to be a sound business strategy  vertical product integration and the resulting interdependencies of our divisions exposes us to certain risks 
as a consequence of our vertical integration  our force sensors business may compete with certain of our customers and potential customers for strain gages while our systems may compete with certain of our customers and potential customers for force sensors  who  for that reason  may elect not to do business with us 
in the past we have grown through successful integration of acquired businesses  but this may not continue 
our long term historical growth in revenues and net earnings has resulted in large part from our strategy of expansion through acquisitions 
we cannot assure that we will identify  have the financial capabilities to acquire  or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future 
we also cannot assure that acquisitions that we will complete in the future will be successful 
such acquisitions or investments  including our recent acquisition of kelk  involve a number of risks  including the following we may be unable to achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquisition or investment  we may have difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business  and may have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired business  we may have difficulty incorporating the acquired technologies or products with our existing solutions  our ongoing business and management attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse locations  and we may lose customers of those companies due to the change in control or for other reasons 
the factors noted above could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition or cash flows  particularly in the case of a larger acquisition  such as the kelk acquisition 
from time to time  we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions or investments that are not ultimately consummated 
these negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time  as well as out of pocket costs 
future acquisitions could require us to incur or issue additional indebtedness or issue additional equity 
we financed a portion of the purchase price paid in the kelk acquisition with additional borrowings under our credit agreement 
if we were to undertake future substantial acquisitions for cash  these acquisitions would likely need to be financed in part through bank borrowings or the issuance of public or private debt 
this acquisition financing would likely decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other credit metrics 
our revolving credit facilities require us to obtain the lenders consent for certain additional debt financing and to comply with other covenants  including the application of specific financial ratios 
we cannot assure that the necessary acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms  if and when  required 
if we were to make an acquisition with equity  the acquisition may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common stock 
we might require additional capital to support business growth  and this capital might not be available 
we intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges or opportunities  including the need to develop new offerings or enhance our existing offerings  enhance our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies 
accordingly  we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds 
if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities  our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution  and any new equity securities we issue could have rights  preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock 
any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters  which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities  including potential acquisitions 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us  when we require it  our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited 
to remain successful  we must continue to innovate  and our investments in new technologies may not prove successful 
our future operating results depend on our ability to continually develop  introduce and market new and innovative products  to modify existing products  to respond to technological change  and to customize certain products to meet customer requirements 
there are numerous risks inherent in this process  including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to develop and market new products and applications in a timely fashion to satisfy customer demands 
if this occurs  we could lose customers and experience adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations 
our success is dependent upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of the protections provided by applicable patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret laws  as well as on confidentiality procedures and other contractual arrangements  to establish and protect our rights in our technology and related materials and information 
we enter into agreements with our customers and distributors 
these agreements contain confidentiality and non disclosure provisions  a limited warranty covering our products and indemnification for the customer from infringement actions related to our products 
despite our efforts  it may be possible for others to copy portions of our products  reverse engineer them or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary  all of which could adversely affect our competitive position 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop technology similar to ours 
the laws of certain countries in which we manufacture do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
in the office of the united states trade representative ustr annual special report released on april   the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection in a number of foreign countries were analyzed 
a number of countries in which we manufacture are identified in the report as being on the priority watch list 
in china  for instance  the ustr is concerned about the existence of serious obstacles to the effective protection of intellectual property rights  including the concern that china may treat foreign owned intellectual property differently than that owned or developed in china 
the ustr also expressed concern that india continues to have a weak legal framework and ineffective overall enforcement 
argentina  indonesia  russia  thailand  ukraine  and venezuela were also identified because of problems in intellectual property enforcement 
the absence of harmonized intellectual property protection laws and effective enforcement makes it difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent and other intellectual property rights on a worldwide basis 
as a result  it is possible that we will not be able to enforce our rights against third parties that misappropriate our proprietary technology in those countries 
the success of our business is highly dependent on maintenance of intellectual property rights 
the unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights may increase the cost of protecting these rights or reduce our revenues 
we seek to protect trade secrets and our other proprietary technology in part by requiring each of our employees to enter into non disclosure and intellectual property assignment agreements 
in these agreements  the employee agrees to maintain the confidentiality of all of our proprietary information and  subject to certain exceptions  to assign to us all rights in any proprietary information or technology made or contributed by the employee during his or her employment 
generally  we do not enter into non compete arrangements with our employees  with the exception of certain executives and  in some cases  one or more of the principals of the businesses that we acquire 
all of these types of agreements may be breached or be found unenforceable  and we may not have an adequate remedy for any such breach of  or inability to enforce  these agreements 
we may initiate  or be subject to  claims or litigation for infringement of proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights  which could result in significant expense to us  cause product shipment delays  require us to enter royalty or licensing agreements  and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel from productive tasks  whether or not such litigation were determined in our favor 
we may be exposed to product liability claims 
while our agreements with our customers and distributors typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential material product liability claims  including appropriate warranty  indemnification  damages waiver and limitation of liability provisions  it is possible that such provisions may not be effective under the laws of some jurisdictions  thus exposing us to substantial liability 
moreover  defending a suit  regardless of its merits  could entail substantial expense and require the time and attention of key management personnel 
if product liability claims are brought against us  the costs associated with defending such claims may adversely affect our results of operations and future cash flows 
we must expend significant resources to obtain design wins without assurance that we will be successful 
in many cases  we must initiate communication with our customers  and convince the customer that our products and systems will offer solutions for its business that are technically superior and more cost effective compared to their existing arrangements 
to do so we must often expend significant financial and human resources to develop technologically compelling products or systems with no guarantee that they will be adopted by our customers 
the non recurring engineering nre costs for product development in these cases could be substantial and may adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to recover these costs 
also  customers will often require a lengthy period of onsite testing before committing to purchase a product or system  during which period we will not receive material revenue from the customer 
while a design win for our products and systems may result in a long period of recurring revenue during which we hope to recover our costs  we must often internally finance our development costs over significant time periods 
if our products or systems fail to gain acceptance with our customers  we will likely be forced to absorb substantial nre costs  which could adversely affect our business 
the long development times for certain of our products and systems may result in unpredictable fluctuations in revenue and results of operations 
our force sensor products and weighing and control systems often involve long product development cycles  both to develop the product or system and to secure customer acceptance following what may be a lengthy onsite testing period 
during product development and testing  we may incur substantial costs without corresponding revenues 
if our custom product or system is ultimately accepted by the customer  we may then begin to realize substantial revenues from our development efforts 
in particular  our weighing and control systems can be priced for several hundred thousand dollars per unit  so that a contract to acquire one or more units can materially contribute to our revenues during the period or periods that we are permitted to recognize the contract revenues for accounting purposes 
the nature of our products and systems may therefore result in substantial fluctuations in our operating results  including revenues and profitability  from period to period  even though there has been no fundamental change in our business or its prospects 
this may make it difficult for investors to undertake period to period comparisons of our performance 
also  the fluctuating nature of key components of our revenues may limit the visibility of our management regarding performance in future periods and make it more difficult for our management to provide guidance to our investors 
we may not have adequate facilities to satisfy future increases in demand for our products 
our business is cyclical and in periods of a rising economy  we may experience intense demand for our products 
during such periods  we may have difficulty expanding our manufacturing capacity to satisfy demand 
factors which could limit such expansion include delays in procurement of manufacturing equipment  shortages of skilled personnel  and physical constraints on expansion at our facilities 
if we are unable to meet our customers requirements and our competitors sufficiently expand production  we could lose customers and or market share 
these losses could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
also  capacity that we add during upturns in the business cycle may result in excess capacity during periods when demand for our products recedes  resulting in inefficient use of capital adversely affecting our business 
the nature of the market for our products may render them particularly susceptible to downturns in the economic environment 
our products are designed to replace and provide superior functionality over existing product infrastructure utilized by our customers 
often  it is only after introductory demonstrations by our sales and engineering teams that our customers come to appreciate the advantages of our products and systems and the long term benefits of their adoption 
market factors  such as the recession that we have recently experienced  may make customers less receptive to adopting new technological solutions at our suggestion  even ones with demonstrated operational and financial advantages 
during these periods  customers may defer or even cancel orders for products and systems for which they have previously contracted or given indications of interest 
also  because our business is concentrated largely in the industrial sector  we do not benefit from countervailing fluctuations in consumer demand 
as a result  our business may be more significantly affected by the consequences of a general economic slowdown than other segments of our industry and may also take longer to recover from the effects of a slowdown 
another sustained slowdown or significant downturn in our global markets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows again 
growth rates in certain of our markets began to slow in the second half of  particularly in our european markets where the recovery remains sluggish due to the unwinding of fiscal stimuli  lingering high unemployment  concerns over european sovereign debt issues and the tightening of government budgets 
we continue to see slowing growth rates in our markets 
further disruptions in europe or in other economies could affect our revenues or liquidity 
continued inflationary pressures in emerging market countries could cause their governments to further tighten credit and raise interest rates  resulting in slowing economic growth 
if the global economy  or some of our significant markets  were to undergo a sustained slowdown or another significant downturn  depending upon the length  duration and severity of such a slowdown or downturn  our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow would likely be materially adversely affected 
our backlog is subject to customer cancellation 
many of the orders that comprise our backlog may be canceled by our customers without penalty 
our customers  particularly for our foil technology products  often cancel orders when business is weak and inventories are excessive  a situation that we have experienced during periods of economic slowdown 
therefore  we cannot be certain that the amount of our backlog accurately forecasts the level of orders that will ultimately be delivered 
our results of operations could be adversely impacted if customers cancel a material portion of orders in our backlog 
the complexity of our sophisticated weighing and control systems may require costly corrections if design flaws are found 
our weighing and control systems combine sophisticated electronic hardware and computer software 
we believe that the sophistication of our systems contributes to their competitive advantage over similar products offered by other system integrators 
we go to substantial lengths to assure that our system products are free of design flaws when they are delivered to our customers for installation and testing 
however  due to the systems complexity  design flaws may occur and require correction 
if the requisite corrections are substantial or difficult to implement due to the systems complexity  we may not be able to recover the costs of correction and retesting  with the result that our profit margins on these systems could be substantially reduced  or even negated by losses  and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our results are sensitive to raw material availability  quality  and cost 
although most materials incorporated in our products are available from a number of sources  certain materials are available only from a relatively limited number of suppliers 
the materials that are only available from a limited number of sources include certain molding compounds  metal package suppliers  low resistance switches  polyimide film and laminating adhesives 
we generally maintain a supply of strategic raw materials for continuity and risk management 
our customers would need significant advance notification to qualify alternative materials  if we had to use them 
alternative suppliers are available worldwide for most of our raw materials  but significant time between to months would be required to qualify new suppliers and establish efficient production scheduling 
certain metals used in the manufacture of our products are traded on active markets  and can be subject to significant price volatility 
our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials  if the quality of available raw materials deteriorates  if there are significant price changes for these raw materials  or if compliance with the laws and regulations described below proves costly and time consuming 
for periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising  we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers  which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used 
for periods in which the prices are declining  we may be required to write down our inventory carrying cost of these raw materials  since we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
depending on the extent of the difference between market price and our carrying cost  this write down could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings 
we also may need to record losses for adverse purchase commitments for these materials in periods of declining prices 
there is new us legislation to improve the transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals coming from the conflict zones of the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries 
this new legislation requires that  starting in the calendar year beginning january   a reporting company that determines that certain metals  dubbed conflict minerals by the sec which include tantalum  gold  tin and tungsten  are necessary to the functionality or production of a product it manufactures or contracts to have manufactured must file a specialized disclosure form with the sec 
the implementation of these requirements could increase our legal compliance costs and affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of our products 
also  since our supply chain is complex  we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all metals used in our products 
our product sales may be adversely affected by changes in product classification levels under various qualification and specification standards 
certain of our products must be qualified or approved under various military and aerospace specifications and other standards 
we have qualified certain of our foil resistor products under various military specifications approved and monitored by the dla  and under certain european military specifications  and various aerospace standards approved by nasa and the esa 
certain of our force sensor products are approved by the ntep and oiml 
our on board weighing systems must meet approved standards to make them legal for trade 
qualification and specification levels are based in part upon product failure rate 
we must continuously perform tests on our products  and for products that are qualified  the results of these tests must be reported to the qualifying organization 
if a product fails to meet the requirements for the applicable classification level  the product s classification may be suspended or reduced to a lower level 
during the time that the classification is suspended or reduced to a lower level  net revenues and earnings attributable to that product may be adversely affected 
our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  managerial  marketing  finance  and administrative personnel 
the competitive environment of our business requires us to attract and retain highly qualified personnel to develop technological innovations and bring them to market on a timely basis 
our complex operations also require us to attract and retain highly qualified administrative personnel in functions such as legal  tax  accounting  financial reporting  and treasury 
the market for personnel with such qualifications is highly competitive 
we have not entered into employment agreements with many of our key personnel 
the loss of the services of  or the failure to effectively recruit  qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
failure to maintain effective internal controls could adversely affect our ability to meet our reporting requirements 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports  and to effectively prevent fraud 
internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of inherent limitations  including the possibility of human error  the circumvention or overriding of controls  or fraud 
therefore  even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements 
if we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and effectively prevent fraud  our operating results could be harmed 
in addition  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
our acquisition of new businesses  such as our recent acquisition of kelk  requires the integration and harmonization of the acquired business internal controls with our existing internal controls in order to properly account for the acquired business assets and operations 
if we fail to maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls  including any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or if we experience difficulties in their implementation  our business and operating results could be harmed  we could fail to meet our reporting obligations  and there could be a material adverse effect on our stock price 
future changes in our environmental liability and compliance obligations may harm our ability to operate or increase costs 
our manufacturing operations  products and or packaging are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions  wastewater discharges  the handling  disposal and remediation of hazardous substances  wastes and certain chemicals used or generated in our manufacturing processes  employee health and safety labeling or other notifications with respect to the content or other aspects of our processes  products or packaging  restrictions on the use of certain materials in or on design aspects of our products or packaging  and responsibility for disposal of products or packaging 
we establish reserves for specifically identified potential environmental liabilities which we believe are adequate 
nevertheless  new liabilities could arise  and we may have unavoidably inherited certain pre existing environmental liabilities  generally based on successor liability doctrines 
although we have never been involved in any environmental matter that has had a material adverse impact on our overall operations  there can be no assurance that in connection with any past or future operation  acquisition or otherwise  we will not be obligated to address environmental matters that could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
in addition  more stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future  and we cannot presently determine the modifications  if any  in our operations that any such future regulations might require  or the cost of compliance with these regulations 
our two credit facilities and two term loans subject us to financial and operating restrictions 
in each of october and november  we entered into separate three year revolving credit agreements with banks which we expect to use for working capital and other purposes 
in january  we amended our agreement from and added two year terms loans in connection with our acquisition of the kelk business 
each credit agreement subjects us to certain restrictions 
these restrictions may affect  and in some cases significantly limit or prohibit  among other things  our ability to borrow additional funds  pay dividends or make other distributions  make investments  including capital expenditures  complete acquisitions  engage in transactions with affiliates or subsidiaries  or create liens on our assets 
each credit agreement also requires us to maintain certain financial ratios 
if we fail to comply with the covenant restrictions contained in either credit agreement  that failure could result in defaults under both credit agreements that would accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness under the agreements 
unexpected events  such as a natural disaster  could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operations 
we have manufacturing and other facilities in countries around the world 
unexpected events  including fires or explosions at facilities  natural disasters  such as hurricanes and earthquakes  war or terrorist activities  unplanned outages  supply disruptions  and failures of equipment or systems at any of our facilities could adversely affect our results of operation 
if adverse conditions were to arise with respect to any of our facilities as a result of a natural disaster or other unexpected event  they may result in customer disruption  physical damage to one or more key operating facilities  the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities  the temporary disruptions of information systems  and or an adverse effect on our results of operations 
changes in our tax rate or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 
in addition  audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 
we are subject to income taxes in the us and in various foreign jurisdictions 
domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
our effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions  changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  accruals related to contingent tax liabilities  the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and changes in tax laws 
any of these factors may adversely affect our tax rate and decrease our profitability 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by us federal  state and local tax authorities and by foreign tax authorities 
if these audits result in assessments different from our reserves  our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities 
the obama administration has announced proposals to tax profits of us companies earned abroad 
while it is not possible to predict whether any such proposals will be implemented and how they will ultimately impact us  they may adversely impact our results of operations 
risks relating to our operations outside the united states we obtain substantial benefits by operating in israel  but these benefits may not continue 
we have substantial operations in israel 
the low tax rates in israel applicable to earnings of our operations in that country  compared to the rates in the united states  have the general effect of increasing our net earnings 
any significant increase in the israeli tax rates could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
there can also be no assurance that in the future the israeli government will continue to offer new tax incentive programs applicable to us or that  if it does  such programs will provide the same level of benefits we have historically received or that we will continue to be eligible to benefit from them 
we attempt to improve profitability by operating in countries in which labor costs are low  but the shift of operations to these regions may entail considerable expense 
our strategy is aimed at achieving significant production cost savings through the transfer and expansion of manufacturing operations to and in countries with lower production costs or other incentives  such as costa rica  india  israel  the people s republic of china  and the republic of china taiwan 
during this process  we may experience under utilization of certain plants and factories in higher labor cost regions and capacity constraints in plants and factories located in lower labor cost regions 
also  we may experience delays in the expected transition from a higher cost location to a lower cost one that result in greater than expected use of the higher cost facility 
this transitional utilization may result initially in production inefficiencies and higher costs 
these costs include those associated with compensation in connection with workforce reductions and plant closings in the higher labor cost regions  and start up expenses  manufacturing and construction delays  and increased depreciation costs in connection with the initiation or expansion of production in lower labor cost regions 
in addition  as we implement transfers of certain of our operations we may experience strikes or other types of labor unrest as a result of layoffs or termination of our employees in higher labor cost countries 
in connection with the transfer of manufacturing operations to lower labor cost countries  we are also increasing the level of automation in our plants for the purpose of seeking to optimize our capital and labor resources in production  inventory management  quality control  and warehousing 
although we have substantial experience with automation in several of our plants in higher labor cost countries  there are risks in seeking to increase the level of automation in plants which previously did not use a significant amount of automation 
these risks include the possibility of inefficiencies and higher operating costs in the transition from manual to automated operations  and if the transition extends longer than anticipated  we could suffer product yield inefficiencies  contributing to higher product costs and increasing the time it will take for us to achieve a return on our investment in the capital equipment involved in the automation process 
furthermore  any layoffs or termination of our employees as a result of increased automation may lead to strikes or other types of labor unrest 
we are subject to the risks of political  economic  and military instability in countries outside the united states in which we operate 
some of our products are produced in israel  india  china  and other countries which are particularly subject to risks of political  economic  and military instability 
this instability could result in wars  riots  nationalization of industry  currency fluctuations  and labor unrest 
these conditions could have an adverse impact on our ability to operate in these regions and  depending on the extent and severity of these conditions  could materially and adversely affect our overall financial condition and operating results 
our business has been in operation in israel for over years 
we have never experienced any material interruption in our operations attributable to these factors  in spite of several middle east crises  including wars 
however  we might be adversely affected if events were to occur in the middle east that interfered with our operations in israel 
we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risks which may impact our results of operations 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks  particularly due to market values of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries 
our significant foreign subsidiaries are located in the united kingdom  germany  israel  japan  and india 
we finance our operations in europe and certain locations in asia in local currencies 
our operations in israel and certain locations in asia are largely financed in us dollars  but these subsidiaries also have significant transactions in local currencies 
our exposure to foreign currency risk is mitigated to the extent that the costs incurred and the revenues earned in a particular currency offset one another 
our exposure to foreign currency risk is more pronounced in situations where  for example  production labor costs are predominantly paid in local currencies while the sales revenue for those products is denominated in us dollars 
this situation in particular applies to our operations in israel  china  and taiwan 
beginning in  the company entered into collar options to sell us dollars and purchase israeli shekels to mitigate exposure to fluctuations in us dollar and israeli shekel exchange rates 
the derivative contracts concluded in july of and the company has not entered into any new derivative contracts as of december  a net gain of million on these contracts was recorded for the year ended december  as of december   we did not have in place any other arrangements to mitigate or hedge against exposures relating to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rate 
a change in the mix of the currencies in which we transact our business could have a material effect on results of operations 
furthermore  the timing of cash receipts and disbursements could have a material effect on our results of operations  particularly if there are significant changes in exchange rates in a short period of time 
risks stemming from the spin off background on october   vishay intertechnology announced its intention to spin off its precision measurement and foil resistor businesses into an independent  publicly traded company to be named vishay precision group  inc on july   vishay intertechnology completed the spin off through a tax free stock dividend to vishay intertechnology s stockholders 
prior to the spin off  we entered into a series of agreements that  among other things  allocated assets  liabilities and obligations between vishay intertechnology and us and required cooperation between the parties to fulfill the terms of the spin off and specified the conditions to the spin off 
for a more detailed description of these agreements see our information statement filed with the sec on june  as exhibit to our registration statement on form we have a short operating history as an independent company upon which you can evaluate our performance and  accordingly  our prospects must be considered in light of the risks that any newly independent company encounters 
prior to july   we operated as part of vishay intertechnology 
accordingly  we have a short experience operating as an independent company and performing various corporate functions  including human resources  tax administration  legal including compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and with the periodic reporting obligations of the securities exchange act of  treasury administration  investor relations  insurance  information technology and telecommunications services  as well as the accounting for many items such as equity compensation  income taxes  derivatives  intangible assets and pensions 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties encountered by companies in the early stages of independent business operations  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
some of our historical financial information is not necessarily indicative of our results as a separate company and therefore may not be reliable as an indicator of our future financial results 
some of our historical financial statements were created  in part  from vishay intertechnology s financial statements using our historical results of operations and historical bases of assets and liabilities as part of vishay intertechnology 
accordingly  some of the historical financial information we have included in this document is not necessarily indicative of what our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would have been if we had been a separate  stand alone entity during the periods presented 
the historical financial information is not necessarily indicative of what our results of operations  financial position and cash flows will be in the future 
while the historical results of operations for when we were part of vishay intertechnology include all costs of vishay intertechnology s precision measurement and foil resistor businesses  those historical costs and expenses do not include all of the costs that would have been or will be incurred by us as an independent company 
in addition  we have not made adjustments to that historical financial information to reflect changes  many of which are significant  that have  or will  occur in our cost structure  financing and operations as a result of the spin off 
these changes include potentially increased costs associated with reduced access to resources  economies of scale  and purchasing power 
while our combined and consolidated financial statements are calculated on a separate tax return basis  our effective income tax rate as reflected in our historical financial statements also may not be indicative of our future effective income tax rate 
among other things  the rate may be materially impacted by changes in the mix of our earnings from the various jurisdictions in which we operate  the tax characteristics of our earnings  the timing and amount of earnings of foreign subsidiaries that we repatriate to the united states  which may increase our tax expense and taxes paid  the timing and results of any reviews of our income tax filing positions in the jurisdictions in which we transact business  and the expiration of the tax incentives for manufacturing operations in israel 
we use the mark vishay under license from vishay intertechnology  which could result in product and market confusion 
we use the mark vishay as part of our name and in connection with many of our products 
our use of the vishay mark is governed by an agreement between us and vishay intertechnology  giving us a perpetual  royalty free  worldwide license for the use of the mark 
we believe that it is important that we continue the use of the vishay name in order to benefit from the reputation of the vishay brand  which was first used in connection with our foil resistors and strain gages when vishay intertechnology was founded years ago 
there are risks associated with our use of the vishay mark  however  both for us and for vishay intertechnology 
because both we and vishay intertechnology use the vishay mark  confusion could arise in the market regarding the products offered by the two companies  and there could be a misplaced perception of our continuing to be associated with vishay intertechnology 
also  any negative publicity associated with one of the two companies in the future could adversely affect the public image of the other 
finally  vishay intertechnology will have the right to terminate the license agreement in certain extreme circumstances if we are in material and repeated breach of the terms of the agreement  which would likely have an adverse effect on us and our business 
risks relating to our common stock our smaller size may affect the trading market for our shares 
we are considered a microcap company and our trading volume is likely to fluctuate 
also  it is possible that there will be less market and institutional interest in our shares  and that we will not attract substantial coverage in the analyst community 
as a result  the trading market for our shares may be less liquid  making it more difficult for investors to dispose of their shares at favorable prices  and investors may have less independent information and analysis available to them concerning our company 
our stock price could become more volatile and investments could lose value 
the market price of our common stock and the number of shares traded each day has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly 
the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors  including  but not limited to shortfalls in our expected net revenue  earnings or key performance metrics  changes in recommendations or estimates by securities analysts  the announcement of new products by us or our competitors  quarterly variations in our or our competitors results of operations  a change in our dividend or stock repurchase activities  developments in our industry or changes in the market for technology stocks  changes in rules or regulations applicable to our business  and other factors  including economic instability and changes in political or market conditions 
a significant drop in our stock price could expose us to costly and time consuming litigation  which could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  resulting in an adverse effect on our business

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview vpg is an internationally recognized designer  manufacturer and marketer of components based on resistive foil technology  sensors and sensor based systems specializing in the growing markets of stress  force  weight  pressure  and current measurements 
we provide vertically integrated products and solutions that are primarily based upon our proprietary foil technology 
these products are marketed under a variety of brand names that we believe are characterized as having a very high level of precision and quality 
our global operations enable us to produce a wide variety of products in strategically effective geographical locations that also optimize our resources for specific technologies  sensors  assemblies and systems 
the company s products are precision foil resistors  foil strain gages  and sensors that convert mechanical inputs into an electronic signal for display  processing  interpretation  or control by our instrumentation and systems products 
precision sensors are essential to the accurate measurement  resolution and display of force  weight  pressure  torque  tilt  motion or acceleration  especially in the legal for trade  commercial  and industrial marketplace in a wide variety of applications 
our products are not typically used in the consumer market 
the precision sensor market is growing as a result of the significant increase in intelligent products across virtually all end markets  including medical  agricultural  transportation  industrial  avionics  military  and space applications 
we believe that as oems strive to make products smarter  they are generally integrating more sensors to link the analog physical world with digital control and or response 
until july   our business was part of vishay intertechnology  and our assets and liabilities consisted of those that vishay intertechnology attributed to its precision measurement and foil resistor businesses 
since the spin off on july   we have operated as an independent  publicly traded company  and vishay intertechnology does not retain any ownership interest in us 
vpg reports in three product segments the foil technology products segment  the force sensors segment  and the weighing and control systems segment 
the foil technology products reporting segment is comprised of the foil resistor and strain gage operating segments 
the force sensors reporting segment is comprised of transducers  load cells and modules 
the weighing and control systems reporting segment is comprised of instruments  complete systems for process control  and on board weighing applications 
in january  we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of the george kelk corporation 
kelk engineers  designs and manufactures highly accurate optical and electronic roll force measurement and control equipment primarily used in metals rolling mills and mining applications throughout the world 
this acquisition expands our geographic and end market strength in the metals measurement processing market and will add new products to our weighing and control systems reporting segment 
net revenues for the year ended december  were million versus million for the prior year 
net earnings attributable to vpg stockholders for the year ended december  were million  or per diluted share  versus million  or per diluted share  for the prior year 
financial metrics we utilize several financial measures and metrics to evaluate the performance and assess the future direction of our business 
these key financial measures and metrics include net revenues  gross profit margin  end of period backlog  book to bill ratio  and inventory turnover 
gross profit margin is computed as gross profit as a percentage of net revenues 
gross profit is generally net revenues less costs of products sold  but could also include certain other period costs 
gross profit margin is clearly a function of net revenues  but also reflects our cost cutting programs and our ability to contain fixed costs 
end of period backlog is one indicator of potential future sales 
we include in our backlog only open orders that have been released by the customer for shipment in the next twelve months 
if demand falls below customers forecasts  or if customers do not control their inventory effectively  they may cancel or reschedule the shipments that are included in our backlog  in many instances without the payment of any penalty 
therefore  the backlog is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods 
another important indicator of demand in our industry is the book to bill ratio  which is the ratio of the amount of product ordered during a period compared with the product that we ship during that period 
a book to bill ratio that is greater than one indicates that demand is higher than current revenues and manufacturing capacities  and it indicates that we may generate increasing revenues in future periods 
conversely  a book to bill ratio that is less than one is an indicator of lower demand compared to existing revenues and current capacities and may foretell declining sales 
we focus on our inventory turnover as a measure of how well we are managing our inventory 
we define inventory turnover for a financial reporting period as our costs of products sold for the four fiscal quarters ending on the last day of the reporting period divided by our average inventory computed using each quarter end balance for this same period 
a higher level of inventory turnover reflects more efficient use of our capital 
the quarter to quarter trends in these financial metrics can also be an important indicator of the likely direction of our business 
the following table shows net revenues  gross profit margin  the end of period backlog  the book to bill ratio  and the inventory turnover for our business as a whole during the five quarters beginning with the fourth quarter of and through the fourth quarter of dollars in thousands th quarter st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter net revenues    gross profit margin end of period backlog      book to bill ratio inventory turnover see financial metrics by segment below for net revenues  gross profit margin  end of period backlog  book to bill ratio  and inventory turnover broken out by segment 
revenues were flat from the fourth quarter of through the rd quarter of revenues decreased in the fourth quarter of mainly due to volume decreases across all product lines and regions 
comparing the fourth quarter of to the third quarter of  the regional breakdown showed a reduction in revenues of million in the americas  million in asia and million in europe 
there was also a slight decline in orders  primarily in the americas and asia  in the fourth quarter of versus the third quarter of gross profit margins remained fairly consistent during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of the second quarter of showed an improvement in gross margins in all of the reporting segments with the most significant increase coming from the force sensors segment 
this was primarily due to volume increases  product mix and the realization of efficiencies from the movement of production to our new facility in india 
in the third quarter of  gross margin dropped to with the most significant decrease coming from the foil technology products segment 
in response to economic conditions  temporary plant shutdowns in two of our subsidiaries led to lower volume and labor inefficiencies 
in the fourth quarter of  gross profit margin improved to  mainly from the foil technology products and force sensors segments 
we began to show improvements in operating efficiencies in the foil technology products segment and we continue to show improvements in operating efficiencies in the force sensors segment  mainly resulting from our new facility in india 
financial metrics by segment the following table shows net revenues  gross profit margin  end of period backlog  book to bill ratio  and inventory turnover broken out by reporting segment for the five quarters beginning with the fourth quarter of  through the fourth quarter of dollars in thousands th quarter st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter foil technology products net revenues    gross profit margin end of period backlog      book to bill ratio inventory turnover force sensors net revenues      gross profit margin end of period backlog      book to bill ratio inventory turnover weighing and control systems net revenues      gross profit margin end of period backlog      book to bill ratio inventory turnover optimize core competence the company s core products incorporate certain technologies to provide customers with precision foil products  force measurement sensors  and systems 
our foil technology products are recognized as global market leaders of strain gages and resistors that provide high precision  high stability over extreme temperature ranges  and long life 
our force sensor products and our weighing and control systems products are also certified to meet some of the highest levels of precision measurements of force  weight  pressure  torque  tilt  motion  and acceleration 
while these competencies form a solid basis for our products  we believe there are several areas that can be optimized  including increasing our technical sales efforts  continuing to innovate in product performance and design  and refining our manufacturing processes 
our foil technology research group continues to provide innovations that enhance the capability and performance of our strain gages  while simultaneously reducing their size and power consumption 
we believe this new level of foil technology will create new markets as customers design in these next generation products in existing and new applications 
our development engineering team is also responsible for creating new processes to further automate manufacturing and improve productivity and quality 
our design  research  and product development teams  in partnership with our marketing teams  drive our efforts to bring innovations to market 
we intend to leverage our insights into customer demand to continually develop and roll out new  innovative products within our existing lines and to modify our existing core products in ways that make them more appealing  addressing changing customer needs and industry trends in terms of form  fit  and function 
acquisition strategy to date  our growth and acquisition strategy largely focused on vertical product integration  using our foil strain gages in our force sensor products and incorporating our sensors and electronic measurement instrumentation and software into our weighing and control systems 
precision foil resistor products are also used in many of the control systems that we manufacture 
the kelk acquisition will provide growth in our weighing and control systems segment  through expansion into the metals measurement processing market 
we expect to continue to make strategic acquisitions  like the kelk acquisition  particularly where opportunities present themselves to grow our force sensors segment and our weighing and control systems segment 
we believe acquired businesses will benefit from improvements we implement to reduce redundant functions and from our current global manufacturing operations and distribution channels 
research and development research and development will continue to play a key role in our efforts to introduce innovative products to generate new sales and to improve profitability 
we expect to continue to expand our position as a leading supplier of precision foil technology products 
we believe our r d efforts should provide us with a variety of opportunities to leverage technology  products  and our manufacturing base in order to ultimately improve our financial performance 
the amount charged to expense for research and development aggregated million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
cost management to be successful  we believe we must seek new strategies for controlling operating costs 
through automation in our plants  we believe we can optimize our capital and labor resources in production  inventory management  quality control  and warehousing 
we are in the process of moving some manufacturing from higher labor cost countries to lower labor cost countries  such as costa rica  india  and israel 
this will enable us to become more efficient and cost competitive  and also maintain tighter controls of the operation 
our acquisition strategy may involve a focus on reducing selling  general  and administrative expenses and achieving significant production cost savings at acquired companies 
the plant closure and employee termination costs subsequent to acquisitions are also integral to our cost reduction programs 
production transfers  facility consolidations  and other long term cost cutting measures require us to initially incur significant severance and other exit costs 
we have begun to realize the benefits of our restructuring through lower labor costs and other operating expenses  and expect to continue reaping these benefits in future periods 
however  these programs to improve our profitability also involve certain risks which could materially impact our future operating results  as further detailed in item a risk factors of this annual report on form k 
we did not initiate any new restructuring programs during the years ended december    or and thus did not record any restructuring expenses during those years 
we are presently executing plans to further reduce our costs by consolidating additional manufacturing operations with our expansion into india 
these plans will require us to incur restructuring and severance costs in future periods 
however  after implementing these plans  we do not anticipate significant restructuring and severance costs for our business except in the context of acquisition integration 
while streamlining and reducing fixed overhead  we are exercising caution so that we will not negatively impact our customer service  or our ability to further develop products and processes 
israeli government incentives we have substantial manufacturing operations in israel  where we benefit from the government s tax incentive programs 
these benefits take the form of reduced tax rates that are lower than those in the united states 
foreign currency we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks  particularly due to transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries 
us generally accepted accounting principles gaap require that entities identify the functional currency of each of their subsidiaries and measure all elements of the financial statements in that functional currency 
a subsidiary s functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates 
in cases where a subsidiary is relatively self contained within a particular country  the local currency is generally deemed to be the functional currency 
however  a foreign subsidiary that is a direct and integral component or extension of the parent company s operations generally would have the parent company s currency as its functional currency 
we have subsidiaries that fall into each of these categories 
foreign subsidiaries which use the local currency as the functional currency we finance our operations in europe and certain locations in asia using local currencies  and accordingly  these subsidiaries utilize the local currency as their functional currency 
for those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency  assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets have been translated at the rate of exchange as of the balance sheet date 
translation adjustments do not impact the results of operations and are reported as a separate component of equity 
for those subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency  revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the year 
while the translation of revenues and expenses into us dollars does not directly impact the consolidated statement of operations  the translation effectively increases or decreases the us dollar equivalent of revenues generated and expenses incurred in those foreign currencies 
foreign subsidiaries which use the us dollar as the functional currency our operations in israel and certain locations in asia are largely financed in us dollars  and accordingly  these subsidiaries utilize the us dollar as their functional currency 
for those foreign subsidiaries where the us dollar is the functional currency  all foreign currency financial statement amounts are remeasured into us dollars 
exchange gains and losses arising from remeasurement of foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are included in the results of operations 
while these subsidiaries transact most business in us dollars  they may have significant costs  particularly related to payroll  which are incurred in the local currency 
for the year ended december   exchange rate impacts negatively impacted net revenues by million and positively impacted costs of products sold and selling  general  and administrative expenses by million when compared to the prior year 
for the year ended december   exchange rate impacts positively impacted net revenues by million and negatively impacted costs of products sold and selling  general  and administrative expenses by million when compared to the prior year 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to our combined and consolidated financial statements 
we identify here a number of policies that entail significant judgments or estimates by management 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on product sales during the period when the sales process is complete 
this generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale  title and risk of loss have been transferred  collectability is reasonably assured  and pricing is fixed or determinable 
for a small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss pass at the point of delivery  we recognize revenue upon delivery to the customer  assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met 
some of our larger systems products have post shipment obligations  such as customer acceptance  training  or installation 
in such circumstances  revenue is deferred until the obligation has been completed  unless such obligation is deemed inconsequential and perfunctory 
given the specialized nature of our products  we generally do not allow product returns 
accounts receivable our receivables represent a significant portion of our current assets 
we are required to estimate the collectability of our receivables and to establish allowances for the amount of receivables that will prove uncollectible 
we base these allowances on our historical collection experience  the length of time our receivables are outstanding  the financial circumstances of individual customers  and general business and economic conditions 
derivative contracts beginning in  the company entered into collar options to sell us dollars and purchase israeli shekels to mitigate exposure to fluctuations in us dollar and israeli shekel exchange rates 
this exposure results from our israeli operations utilizing the us dollar as their functional currency 
we do not utilize derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
we record all derivatives in the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities at fair value 
we have not designated any derivatives as hedges for accounting purposes  and as such the changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized in current period earnings as a component of other income expense 
in determining fair value  we consider both the counterparty credit risk and our own credit worthiness 
to determine our own credit risk we estimate our own credit rating by benchmarking the price of outstanding debt to publicly available comparable data from rating agencies 
using the estimated rating  our credit risk was quantified by reference to publicly traded debt with a corresponding rating 
the term of these contracts ended in july of  and the company has not entered into any new contracts as of december  inventories we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined under the first in  first out method  and market based upon net realizable value 
the valuation of our inventories requires our management to make market estimates 
for work in process goods  we are required to estimate the cost to completion of the products and the prices at which we will be able to sell the products 
for finished goods  we must assess the prices at which we believe the inventory can be sold 
inventories are also adjusted for estimated obsolescence and written down to net realizable value based upon estimates of future demand  technology developments and market conditions 
estimates of restructuring and severance costs and purchase related restructuring costs to maintain our cost competitiveness  we are shifting manufacturing emphasis to more advanced automation in higher labor cost regions and relocating production to regions with skilled workforces and relatively lower labor costs 
we also incur similar costs when we acquire companies 
these production transfers  facility consolidations  and other long term cost cutting measures require us to initially incur significant severance and other exit costs 
we anticipate that we will realize the benefits of our restructuring efforts through lower labor costs and other operating expenses in future periods 
restructuring and severance costs are expensed during the period in which we become obligated to pay those costs and all other requirements for accrual are met 
because transfers of manufacturing operations sometimes occur incrementally over a period  the expense initially recorded is often based on estimates 
because these costs are recorded based on estimates  our actual expenditures for restructuring activities may differ from the initially recorded costs 
if this happens  we will need to adjust our estimates in future periods  either by recording additional expenses in future periods  if our initial estimates were too low  or by reversing part of the charges that we recorded initially  if our initial estimates were too high 
impairment of long lived assets we assess the impairment of our long lived assets other than goodwill  including property and equipment and identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review  include significant changes in the manner of our use of the asset  changes in historical or projected operating performance  and significant negative economic trends 
pension and other postretirement benefits accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates 
the discount rate at which obligations could effectively be settled and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligations of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
other important assumptions include the anticipated rate of future increases in compensation levels  estimated mortality  and for postretirement medical plans  increases or trends in health care costs 
management reviews these assumptions at least annually 
we use independent actuaries to assist us in formulating assumptions and making estimates 
these assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis  as appropriate 
our defined benefit plans are concentrated in the united states and the united kingdom 
plans in these countries comprise approximately of our retirement obligations at december  we utilize published long term high quality bond indices to determine the discount rate at the measurement date 
we utilize bond yields at various maturity dates to reflect the timing of expected future benefit payments 
we believe the discount rates selected are the rates at which these obligations could effectively be settled 
for benefit plans which are funded  we establish strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk 
we set the expected long term rate of return based on the expected long term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolios 
in establishing this rate  we consider historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested  advice from pension consultants and investment advisors  and current economic and capital market conditions 
the expected return on plan assets is incorporated into the computation of pension expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
we believe that the current assumptions used to estimate plan obligations and annual expense are appropriate in the current economic environment 
however  if economic conditions change  we may be inclined to change some of our assumptions  and the resulting change could have a material impact on the combined and consolidated statements of operations and on the consolidated balance sheet 
income taxes our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid 
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements  which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider future taxable income by tax jurisdiction and tax planning strategies 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to equal an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in projecting future taxable income  we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state  federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences 
the assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide  we consider three years of cumulative operating income loss 
changes in tax laws and tax rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
we are not aware of any current changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
accounting standards codification topic  income taxes asc states that a benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  on the basis of the technical merits 
we first record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with asc and then adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available at the time of establishing the liability 
because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available 
as of december   the company anticipates that it is reasonably possible that approximately million to million of its current unrecognized tax benefits may be reversed within the next twelve months of the reporting date as a result of a lapse of the statute of limitation in certain jurisdictions 
we consider the earnings of certain non us subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs and our specific plans for reinvestment of those subsidiary earnings 
withholding taxes of approximately million would be payable upon remittance of all previously unremitted earnings at december  should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings  we would need to adjust our income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside the united states 
on july   we entered into a tax matters agreement with vishay intertechnology under which vishay intertechnology will be responsible for all income taxes for periods before the date of the spin off other than those taxes for which a liability was recorded on our books at the time of the spin off 
vishay intertechnology is also principally responsible for managing any income tax audits by the various tax jurisdictions for pre spin off periods 
we have joint and several liability with vishay intertechnology to multiple tax authorities 
however  under the terms of the tax matters agreement  vishay intertechnology has agreed to assume this liability and any similar liability for us federal  state or local and foreign income taxes that are determined on a separate company  consolidated  combined  unitary or similar basis for each taxable period in which vpg was a part of vishay intertechnology s affiliated group prior to july results of operations years ended december    and statement of operations captions as a percentage of net revenues and the effective tax rates were as follows years ended december  costs of products sold gross profit selling  general  and administrative expenses operating income income before taxes net earnings net earnings attributable to vpg stockholders parent effective tax rate net revenues net revenues were as follows dollars in thousands years ended december  net revenues    change versus prior year   percentage change versus prior year changes in net revenues were attributable to the following vs

the fluctuation in foreign currencies also aided the improvement in revenues 
gross profit and margins gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was as follows years ended december  gross margin percentage for the year ended december   the decrease in gross margin percentage when compared to the prior year was due to lower volume  higher fixed manufacturing costs such as wages  utilities  and it costs  and depreciation

gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the force sensors segment was as follows years ended december  gross margin percentage for the year ended december   the increase in the gross margin percentage when compared to the prior year is mainly due to an improved product mix and the realization of cost savings from the movement of production to our new facility in india 
for the year ended december   the decrease in gross margin percentage when compared to the prior year was due to product mix  higher variable costs and manufacturing fixed costs  including wages and material usage  and start up costs at our new india facility

vs 
change attributable to change in volume change in average selling prices foreign currency effects other net change the decrease in volume for the year ended december  compared to the prior year is primarily due to the reduction in on board weighing revenues in europe 
the increase in volume for the year ended december  compared to the prior year was due to higher volume across all lines of business 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the weighing and control systems segment was as follows years ended december  gross margin percentage for the year ended december   the gross margin percentage increased from the prior year mainly due to product mix 
a portion of our european on board weighing business  where the significant volume decrease occurred  has relatively low margins compared to the other lines of business in this segment 
therefore  while overall volume was down from the prior year  the gross margin increased compared to the prior year 
for the year ended december   the increase in gross margin percentage when compared to the prior year was primarily due to higher volume across all lines of business 
selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses are summarized as follows dollars in thousands years ended december  total sg a expenses    as a percentage of sales given the specialized nature of our products and our direct sales approach  we incur significant selling  general  and administrative costs 
sg a expenses for the year ended december  decreased versus the prior year 
this decrease is due to a reduction in professional service fees of million  a decrease in bonuses of million and favorable exchange rate fluctuations of million  partially offset by higher wage costs of million 
sg a expenses for the year ended december  increased versus the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to an increase of million due to wage increases  it costs  travel  and commissions  an increase of million for additional personnel and fees related to functioning as an independent  publicly traded company  and unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations of million 
sg a expenses for the year ended december   included allocations of corporate overhead costs from vishay intertechnology of million  and are not directly comparable to the costs that we incurred in as an independent public company 
through the date of the spin off  we had significant agreements  transactions  and relationships with vishay intertechnology operations outside the defined scope of our business 
while these transactions are not necessarily indicative of the terms we would have achieved had we been a separate entity  management believes they are reasonable 
a description of these transactions and allocations is included in note to our combined and consolidated financial statements 
historically  we used the corporate services of vishay intertechnology for a variety of functions including treasury  tax  legal  internal audit  human resources  and risk management 
as of the spin off  we are an independent  publicly traded company and we incurred and will continue to incur additional sg a costs associated with being an independent  publicly traded company 
these additional costs may not be reflected in the historical combined and consolidated financial statements for periods prior to july  pursuant to the transition services agreement  vishay intertechnology provided vpg certain information technology support services for its foil resistor business 
the transition services agreement terminated on march  vishay intertechnology no longer provides the company with information technology support services 
since inception  million was paid to vishay intertechnology for transition services 
acquisition costs in connection with the acquisition of the kelk business in january  we recorded million of acquisition costs in our combined and consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december   which are comprised of the following in thousands year ended december  accounting and legal fees appraisal fees other other income expense total interest expense for the year ended december  was comparable with the prior year 
interest expense for the year ended december  consisted of interest on the exchangeable notes issued in connection with the spin off and the amortization of deferred bank costs associated with securing a revolving credit facility 
the following table analyzes the components of the line other on the combined and consolidated statement of operations in thousands years ended december  change foreign exchange loss  interest income other foreign currency exchange gains and losses represent the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates with  among other things  the revaluation of balance sheet accounts 
the company recorded a foreign exchange loss of million during as compared to a foreign exchange loss of million during the foreign exchange loss during the year is largely due to the revaluation of the non us dollar denominated assets at the company israeli operations and the movement of the us dollar compared to the euro and the indian rupee 
other expense was million for the year ended december  as compared to million in the prior year 
included in other expense during is a million income tax indemnification adjustment 
total interest expense for the year ended december  decreased by million versus the prior year 
interest expense for the year ended december  consisted of interest on the exchangeable notes issued in connection with the spin off and the overdraft facility in india 
interest expense for the year ended december  was primarily associated with the net payable to vishay intertechnology 
interest expense on the net payable to vishay intertechnology through the date of the spin off is included in the combined and consolidated financial statements based on the prevailing interest rate of vishay intertechnology s revolving credit facility 
the following table analyzes the components of the line other on the combined and consolidated statement of operations in thousands years ended december  change foreign exchange loss   interest income other foreign currency exchange gains and losses represent the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates with  among other things  the revaluation of balance sheet accounts 
the company recorded a foreign exchange loss of million during as compared to a foreign exchange loss of million during the foreign exchange loss during the year is largely due to the revaluation of the non us dollar denominated assets at the company israeli operations and the movement of the us dollar compared to the euro  the indian rupee and the taiwanese dollar 
income taxes our effective tax rate  based on earnings before income taxes  for the year ended december  was  as compared to for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  our tax rate is affected by recurring items  such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions as compared to the us federal statutory tax rate  and the relative amount of income earned in those jurisdictions 
it is also impacted by discrete items that may occur in any given year  but are not consistent from year to year and may not be indicative of our continued operations 
the following items had the most significant impact on the difference between our statutory us federal income tax rate and our effective tax rate a rate reduction due to the net reversal of a valuation allowance recorded on deferred tax assets 
the primary driver  or of the reduction  came from a favorable tax ruling received in the fourth quarter of from the israeli tax authority approving the merger of several wholly owned israeli entities 
as part of the ruling  we were able to access net operating losses that  on a stand alone basis  were not available to other members of the israeli group 
we feel there is sufficient positive evidence existing as of december  to conclude that it is more likely than not that the israeli net operating losses are now realizable  and therefore  reduced the valuation allowance accordingly 
a rate reduction resulting from tax rate differences between u 
s and non us jurisdictions 
no non us taxes were provided  as the undistributed foreign earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states 
the primary driver of the rate difference is associated with our operations in israel 
a rate increase due to the accrual of foreign withholding taxes relating to our global operations 
a rate increase associated with statutory tax rate changes 
a rate reduction resulting from tax rate differences between us and us jurisdictions 
no us taxes were provided  as the undistributed foreign earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states 
the primary driver of the rate difference is associated with our operations in israel 
a rate increase due to the net build of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  primarily relating to current year net operating losses incurred in israel 
under applicable accounting principles  we may not recognize deferred tax assets for loss carryforwards in jurisdictions where there is strong negative evidence that these losses will not be utilized 
a rate increase due to the recording of an uncertain tax position relating to a foreign jurisdiction in which we operate 
a rate increase due to state income taxes net of federal income tax benefit

financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources at december  and december   we had significant cash balances and limited third party debt 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  credit facilities and projected cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next months 
effective july   we issued approximately million aggregate principal amount of exchangeable notes pursuant to agreements entered into in connection with our spin off from vishay intertechnology 
the maturity date of these notes is december  our other long term debt is not significant and consists of debt held by one of our japanese subsidiaries of approximately million at december  and million at december  in  we entered into a credit agreement credit agreement among the company  the lenders  rbs citizens  national association as joint book runner and jpmorgan chase bank  national association as agent for such lenders the agent  pursuant to which the lenders have made available to the company a multi currency  secured credit facility

see note to our combined and consolidated financial statements for more details 
due to our strong product portfolio and market position  our business has historically generated significant cash flow 
our cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was impacted by slight reductions in working capital accounts compared to a significant increase in working capital accounts for the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was impacted by tax payments made during  bonus profit sharing paid in  and other changes in working capital accounts 
our cash flows from operating activities during the year ended december  were negatively impacted by the transition of selling activities to vpg s dedicated sales forces for certain of our foil technology products effective june   in anticipation of the spin off 
these sales activities were previously performed by vishay intertechnology 
as a result of this transition  our third party accounts receivable increased significantly  which had a corresponding negative impact on cash flows from operating activities 
approximately and of our cash and cash equivalents balance at december  and december   respectively  was held by our non us subsidiaries 
see the following table for the percentage of cash and cash equivalents  by region  at december  and december december  israel united states asia europe united kingdom total we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the united states  which is deemed to be indefinitely reinvested in the foreign jurisdictions 
we currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds 
we expect existing domestic cash and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities  such as debt repayment and capital expenditures  for at least the next months and thereafter for the foreseeable future 
if we should require more capital in the united states than is generated by our domestic operations  for example  to fund significant discretionary activities such as business acquisitions  we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the united states through debt or equity issuances 
these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates  increased interest expense  or dilution of our earnings 
we consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of december   to be indefinitely reinvested and  accordingly  no us income taxes have been provided thereon 
as of december   the amount of cash associated with indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately million 
we have not  nor do we anticipate the need to  repatriate funds to the united states to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business  including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements 
we refer to the amount of cash generated from operations in excess of our capital expenditure needs and net of proceeds from the sale of assets as free cash  a measure which management uses to evaluate our ability to fund acquisitions 
we historically have generated positive free cash  even in the recent recession  and we expect to continue to be able to do so 
the following table summarizes the components of net cash debt at december  and at december  in thousands december  cash and cash equivalents   third party debt  including current and long term third party debt held by japanese subsidiary   exchangeable notes due   total third party debt   net cash   measurements such as free cash and net cash debt do not have uniform definitions and are not recognized in accordance with us gaap 
such measures should not be viewed as alternatives to gaap measures of performance or liquidity 
however  management believes that free cash is a meaningful measure of our ability to fund acquisitions  and that an analysis of net cash debt assists investors in understanding aspects of our cash and debt management 
these measures  as calculated by us  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
our financial condition as of december  is strong  with a current ratio current assets to current liabilities of to  as compared to a ratio of to at december  this increase in the current ratio is primarily due to an increase in inventories and decreases in trade accounts payable  other accrued expenses and income taxes  partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable  deferred income taxes and prepaid expenses  and an increase in payroll and related liabilities at december  cash paid for property and equipment for the year ended december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
capital spending for was comprised of projects related to the normal maintenance of business  cost reduction programs and some carryover projects from we incurred significant capital expenditures in  which included the construction of a new manufacturing facility in india that consolidated the majority of our existing manufacturing capacity in the force sensors segment into a low labor rate facility  and a new manufacturing line that began producing a new product offering in the foil technology products segment 
the construction of the manufacturing facility in india has been completed and the facility is fully operational 
capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately to million 
contractual commitments as of december   we had contractual obligations as follows in thousands payments due by period less than after total year years years years long term debt  interest payments on long term debt   operating leases    non competition agreements estimated costs to complete construction in progress unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties expected pension and postretirement plan funding     total contractual cash obligations     our consolidated balance sheet at december   includes approximately million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions relating to multiple taxing jurisdictions 
there are certain guarantees and indemnifications extended among vishay intertechnology and us in accordance with the terms of the master separation and distribution agreement and the tax matters agreement 
the guarantees primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities included in the tax matters agreement 
see note to our combined and consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the tax matters agreement 
of the million of unrecognized tax benefits  million are associated with our post spin off operation  and thus are not covered under the terms of the tax matters agreement 
due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations  combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded  we cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of the remaining cash outflows relating to these liabilities 
accordingly  the remaining uncertain tax positions are classified as payments due after five years  although actual timing of payments may be sooner 
inflation normally  inflation does not have a significant impact on our operations as our products are not generally sold on long term contracts 
consequently  we can adjust our selling prices  to the extent permitted by competition  to reflect cost increases caused by inflation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain financial risks  including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and commodity prices 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through internally established policies and procedures and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
our policies do not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and we are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
we monitor our underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believe that we can modify or adapt our strategies as needed 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances 
at december   we have million outstanding on our exchangeable notes  which bear interest at libor 
the company entered into a revolving credit facility on october  interest payable on the facility is based upon the agent s prime rate  the federal funds rate or libor 
at december   the company had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
vat  an israeli subsidiary of the company  entered into a revolving credit facility in november  in israel 
interest payable on the facility is based upon libor 
at december   vat had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
at december   we have million of cash and cash equivalents  which accrues interest at various variable rates 
based on the debt and cash positions at december  and  we would expect a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates to increase or decrease our annualized net earnings by approximately million and million  respectively 
see note and note to our combined and consolidated financial statements for additional information about our long term debt 
foreign exchange risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks  particularly due to market values of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries 
during  as a part of our funding activities in israel  we entered into collar options to sell us dollars and purchase israeli shekels to mitigate exposure to fluctuations in us dollar and israeli shekel exchange rates 
the term of these contracts ended in july of  and the company has not entered into any new contracts as of december  we recorded a net gain on these contracts of million for the year ended december   which is recorded on the combined and consolidated statement of operations as part of other income expense 
at december   the notional amount of the derivative contracts was approximately million shekels and had a fair value of million recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as a part of other accrued expenses 
these were foreign currency collar instruments  wherein the weighted minimal hedged rate was shekels per us dollar and the maximum hedged rate was shekels per us dollar 
we recorded a net loss on these contracts of million for the year ended december  these losses were recorded on the combined and consolidated statement of operations as part of other income expense 
as of december   we did not have any outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments 
our significant foreign currency exposures are to the british pound  israeli shekel  euro  indian rupee  japanese yen  swedish krona  taiwanese dollar  and chinese renminbi 
with our acquisition of kelk in january  we will also have foreign currency exposure to the canadian dollar 
we finance our operations in europe and certain locations in asia in local currencies 
our operations in israel and certain locations in asia are largely financed in us dollars  but these subsidiaries also have significant transactions in local currencies 
our exposure to foreign currency risk is mitigated to the extent that the costs incurred and the revenues earned in a particular currency offset one another 
our exposure to foreign currency risk is more pronounced in israel and china because the percentage of expenses denominated in israeli shekels and chinese renminbi to total expenses is much greater than the percentage of sales denominated in israeli shekels and chinese renminbi to total sales 
therefore  if the israeli shekel and chinese renminbi strengthen against all or most of our other major currencies  our operating profit is reduced 
we also have a higher percentage of british pound denominated sales than expenses 
therefore  when the british pound strengthens against all or most of our other major currencies  our operating profit is increased 
accordingly  we monitor several important cross currency rates 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis as of december  and  respectively  using a model that measures the change in the values arising from a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar  with all other variables held constant 
the foreign currency exchange rates we used were based on market rates in effect at december  and  respectively 
the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would impact our net earnings by approximately million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively  although individual line items in our combined and consolidated statement of operations could be materially affected 
for example  a weakening in all foreign currencies would increase the us dollar equivalent of operating income generated in foreign currencies  which would be offset by foreign exchange losses of our foreign subsidiaries that have significant transactions in us dollars or have the us dollar as their functional currency 
a change in the mix of the currencies in which we transact our business could have a material effect on the estimated impact of the hypothetical movement in the value of the us dollar 
furthermore  the timing of cash receipts and disbursements could result in materially different actual results versus the hypothetical movement in the value of the us dollar  particularly if there are significant changes in exchange rates in a short period of time 
commodity price risk although most materials incorporated in our products are available from a number of sources  certain materials are available only from a relatively limited number of suppliers 
some of the most highly specialized materials for our sensors are sourced from a single vendor 
we maintain a safety stock inventory of certain critical materials at our facilities 
certain metals used in the manufacture of our products are traded on active markets  and can be subject to significant price volatility 
our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if we have difficulty obtaining these raw materials  the quality of available raw materials deteriorates  or there are significant price changes for these raw materials 
for periods in which the prices of these raw materials are rising  we may be unable to pass on the increased cost to our customers which would result in decreased margins for the products in which they are used 
for periods in which the prices are declining  we may be required to write down our inventory carrying cost of these raw materials  since we record our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
depending on the extent of the difference between market price and our carrying cost  this write down could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings 
we also may need to record losses for adverse purchase commitments for these materials in periods of declining prices 
we estimate that a increase or decrease in the costs of raw materials subject to commodity price risk would decrease or increase our net earnings by million for the years ended december  and december   respectively  assuming that such changes in our costs have no impact on the selling prices of our products  and that we have no pending commitments to purchase metals at fixed prices
