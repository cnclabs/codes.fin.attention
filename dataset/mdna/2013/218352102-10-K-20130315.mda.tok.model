item  management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations results of operations 
manufacturing korlym as a drug discovery  development and commercialization company  we intend to continue to utilize our financial resources to commercialize korlym and advance other product candidates rather than diverting resources to establishing our own manufacturing facilities 
we intend to continue to rely on experienced contract manufacturers to produce our product candidates 
we have entered into a manufacturing agreement with one contract manufacturer  produits chimiques auxiliaires et de synthese sa pcas  to produce the active pharmaceutical ingredient api for korlym 
the fda approved our commercial use of material produced by pcas as part of our nda submission for korlym 
the agreement with pcas  which was executed in november  was for an initial period of five years with an automatic extension for one additional year and has been extended to june we are pursuing discussions to continue the relationship thereafter 
the agreement calls for us to purchase from pcas at least percent of our requirements until the expiration of the agreement 
if pcas is unable to manufacture the product for a consecutive six month period  we have the right to terminate the agreement  without penalty 
we have also entered into an agreement with another contract manufacturer  pharmaform  llc pharmaform  for the production of korlym tablets 
the agreement with pharmaform was executed in march for an initial period of two years 
the agreement will be automatically extended for additional one year periods unless one party gives six months prior written notice that it does not want such an extension 
the agreement with pharmaform may be terminated by either party upon days written notice  we may terminate projects initiated under this agreement with days written notice 
there are no minimum purchase amounts under this agreement 

table of contents we are currently in negotiations for a commercial manufacturing agreement with aai pharma  our second tablet manufacturer whose facility was approved by the fda for manufacture of our commercial korlym tablets in november competition for korlym korlym competes with established treatments  including surgery  radiation  and approved medicines prescribed off label 
korlym will also compete with novartis drug  signifor pasireotide injection  which the fda approved in december for the treatment of adult patients with cushing s disease a subset of cushing s syndrome who are not candidates for pituitary surgery or for whom surgery did not work 
in april  signifor received marketing approval in the eu 
it has orphan drug designation in both the united states and the eu 
signifor is a somatostatin analogue that inhibits acth production by the pituitary  which leads to reduced cortisol production 
in the phase study that served as the basis for novartis nda  the drug normalized cortisol levels in percent of patients 
sixty seven percent of patients developed hyperglycemia or diabetes 
signifor must be taken twice daily  by injection 
korlym may also experience competition from compounds under development for cushing s syndrome 
we are aware that laboratoire hra pharma hra has received an orphan drug designation in the united states and europe for the use of mifepristone to treat a subtype of cushing s syndrome and has begun a clinical trial in europe and the united states 
if this product is approved for commercialization in the united states and the eu  our potential future revenue could be reduced 
we are also aware that exelgyn laboratories  which operates as a subsidiary of medi challenge pty ltd  received orphan drug designation for endogenous cushing s syndrome in europe  but they have stated that they have not yet conducted any clinical trials 
many colleges  universities and public and private research organizations are also active in the human health care field 
while these entities focus on education  they may develop or acquire proprietary technology that we may require for the development of our product candidates 
we may attempt to obtain licenses to this proprietary technology 
our ability to compete successfully will be based on our ability to develop proprietary products  attract and retain scientific personnel  obtain patent or other protection for our product candidates  obtain required regulatory approvals and manufacture and successfully market korlym and our future products either alone or through outside parties 
intellectual property patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business 
it is our policy to seek patent protection for our inventions  and to rely upon trade secrets  know how  continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position 
under an agreement with stanford university  we have licensed exclusive rights to the following issued us patents and any corresponding foreign patents us patent number subject matter expiration date  use of gr ii antagonists in the treatment of psychotic major depression october   use of gr ii antagonists in the treatment of cocaine induced psychosis october   use of gr ii antagonists in the treatment of early dementia february  the corresponding foreign patents expire in 
table of contents we are required to make milestone payments and pay royalties to stanford university on sales of products commercialized under any of the above patents 
we are currently in compliance with our obligations under the agreement 
if stanford university were to terminate any of our exclusive licenses due to breach of the license on our part  we would not be able to commercialize mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression  cocaine induced psychosis or early dementia 
we also own issued us patents for the use of gr ii antagonists in the treatment of mild cognitive impairment  for the treatment of weight gain following treatment with antipsychotic medication  for the prevention and treatment of stress disorders  for increasing the therapeutic response to ect  for the treatment of delirium  for the treatment of catatonia  for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease and for inhibiting cognitive deterioration in adults with down s syndrome 
the expiration dates of these patents and their foreign counterparts range from to in addition  we have nine us method of use applications covering certain gr ii antagonists  including the treatment of patients suffering from mental disorders by optimizing mifepristone levels in plasma serum  neurological damage in premature infants  muscular dystrophy  migraine headaches  psychosis associated with interferon alpha therapy  depression in patients taking interleukin il  and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als 
the approximate expiration dates of the patents that could issue from these applications and their foreign counterparts range from to we have composition of matter claims on three patent families of novel selective gr ii antagonists 
applications for all of the three families have been allowed in both the united states and europe 
the expiration dates of these us and european patents range from to two additional composition of matter patent applications are pending 
we have also filed  where we deemed appropriate  foreign patent applications corresponding to our us patents and applications 
however  we cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of patents  that any issued patent will include claims of the breadth sought in these applications  or that competitors will not successfully challenge or circumvent our patents if they are issued 
although three of our patents have claims directed to the composition of compounds  we do not have a patent with claims directed to the composition of mifepristone 
our rights under our issued patents related to mifepristone cover only the use of that compound in the treatment of specific diseases 
the composition of matter patent covering mifepristone has expired 
the only previously fda approved use of mifepristone is to terminate pregnancy 
the fda has imposed significant restrictions on the use of mifepristone to terminate pregnancy 
to protect our market for korlym we plan to rely on the exclusive marketing rights conferred as a benefit of orphan drug designation in the united states and eu  the restrictions imposed by the fda on the use of mifepristone to terminate pregnancy  the different patient populations  administering physicians and treatment settings between the use of mifepristone to terminate pregnancy and to treat cushing s syndrome and our method of use patents described above 

table of contents the patent positions of companies in the pharmaceutical industry are highly uncertain  involve complex legal and factual questions and have been and continue to be the subject of much litigation 
our product candidates may give rise to claims that we infringe on the products or proprietary rights of others 
if it is determined that our drug candidates infringe on others patent rights  we may be required to obtain licenses to those rights 
if we fail to obtain licenses when necessary  we may experience delays in commercializing our product candidates while attempting to design around other patents  or determine that we are unable to commercialize our product candidates at all 
if we do become involved in intellectual property litigation  we are likely to incur considerable costs in defending or prosecuting the litigation 
we believe that we do not currently infringe any third party s patents or other proprietary rights  and we are not obligated to pay royalties relating to the use of intellectual property to any third party other than stanford university 
in akzo nobel filed an observation to the grant of our exclusively licensed european patent application with claims directed to psychotic depression 
in february  the epo allowed our patent application 
we are not aware of any other disputes related to patent issues 
license agreement under our exclusive license agreement with stanford university to patents covering the use of mifepristone to treat the psychotic features of psychotic depression and for the treatment of early dementia  we are required to pay stanford  annually as a nonrefundable royalty payment 
this payment is creditable against future royalties 
we are also obligated to pay stanford a  milestone upon the filing of the nda for mifepristone for the treatment of psychotic depression and a further  milestone payment upon fda approval of mifepristone for that indication 
the milestone payments are also creditable against future royalties 
this license agreement expires upon expiration of the related patents or upon notification by us to stanford relating to the use of intellectual property 
see intellectual property 
government regulation prescription pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive pre and post approval regulation  including regulations that govern the testing  manufacturing  safety  efficacy  labeling  storage  record keeping  advertising  and promotion of the products under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act 
all of our product candidates will require regulatory approval by government agencies prior to commercialization 
the process required by the fda before a new drug may be marketed in the united states generally involves the following completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing  submission of an ind  which must become effective before clinical trials may begin  performance of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or biologic s intended use  and  in the case of a new drug  approval by the fda of an nda 
the process of complying with these and other federal and state statutes and regulations in order to obtain the necessary approvals and subsequently complying with federal and state statutes and regulations involves significant time and expense 
preclinical studies are generally conducted in laboratory animals to evaluate the potential safety and the efficacy of a product 
drug developers submit the results of preclinical studies to the fda as a part of an ind  which must be approved before beginning clinical trials in humans 
typically  human clinical trials are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap 
phase clinical trials are conducted with a small number of subjects to determine the early safety profile  maximum tolerated dose and pharmacokinetics of the product candidate in human volunteers 
phase clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease to determine preliminary efficacy  optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety 
phase large scale  multi center  comparative trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease to establish the overall risk benefit ratio of the drug and to provide enough data to demonstrate with substantial evidence the efficacy and safety of the product  as required by the fda 

table of contents the fda and the institutional review boards closely monitor the progress of each of the three phases of clinical trials that are conducted in the united states and may reevaluate  alter  suspend or terminate the testing at any time for various reasons  including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
the fda may also require that additional studies be conducted  such as studies demonstrating that the drug being tested does not cause cancer 
after phase trials are completed  drug developers submit the results of preclinical studies  clinical trials  formulation studies and data supporting manufacturing to the fda in the form of an nda for approval to commence commercial sales 
the fda reviews all ndas submitted before it accepts them for filing 
the fda may request additional information rather than accept an nda for filing 
if the fda accepts an nda for filing  it may grant marketing approval  request additional information or deny the application if it determines that the application does not meet regulatory approval criteria 
once an nda has been accepted for filing  by law the fda has days to examine the application and respond to the applicant 
however  the review process is often significantly extended by fda requests for additional information or clarification 
under the prescription drug user fee act  the fda has a goal of responding to ndas within ten months of the filing date for standard review  and months for priority review if a sponsor shows that its drug candidate provides a significant improvement compared to marketed drugs 
the fda has indicated to us that it will grant us a priority review of our nda of mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression if no other medications have been approved for this indication at the time of our submission 
fda approvals may not be granted on a timely basis  or at all 
if the fda approves an nda  the subject drug becomes available for physicians to prescribe in the united states 
once approved  the fda may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre and post approval regulatory standards is not maintained 
the drug developer must submit periodic reports to the fda 
adverse experiences with the product must be reported to the fda and could result in the imposition of marketing restrictions through labeling changes or product removal 
product approvals may be withdrawn if problems with safety or efficacy occur after the product reaches the marketplace 
in addition  the fda may require post marketing studies  referred to as phase studies  to monitor the effect of approved products  and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post approval studies 
facilities used to manufacture drugs are subject to periodic inspection by the fda and other authorities where applicable  and must comply with current good manufacturing practices regulations cgmp 
failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action  such as suspension of manufacturing  seizure of product or voluntary recall of a product 
with respect to post approval product advertising and promotion  the fda imposes a number of complex regulations on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals  which include  among others  standards and regulations for direct to consumer advertising  off label promotion  industry sponsored scientific and educational activities  and promotional activities involving the internet 
the fda has very broad enforcement authority under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties including the issuance of a warning letter directing a company to correct deviations from fda standards  a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre cleared by the fda  and state and federal civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions 
in addition to studies requested by the fda after approval  a drug developer may conduct other studies to explore use of the approved compound for treatment of new indications 
the purpose of these trials and studies and related publications is to broaden the application and use of the drug and its acceptance in the medical community 
data supporting the use of a drug for these new indications must be submitted to the fda in a new or supplemental nda that must be approved by the fda before the drug can be marketed for the new indications 
orphan drug designation 
we have received orphan drug designation for korlym for the treatment of endogenous cushing s syndrome in both the united states and the eu 
in the united states  orphan drug 
table of contents designation provides special status to a product to treat a rare disease or condition providing that the product meets certain criteria 
orphan designation qualifies the sponsor of the product for the tax credit and marketing incentives of the orphan drug act  including seven years of exclusive marketing rights for the specific drug for the orphan indication  if it receives the first regulatory approval for that indication  with limited exceptions 
a marketing application for a prescription drug product that has been designated as a drug for a rare disease or condition is not subject to a prescription drug user fee unless the application includes an indication for other than a rare disease or condition 
orphan drug designation does not prevent competitors from developing or marketing different drugs for an indication 
it also does not convey an advantage in  or shorten the duration of  the review and approval process for a drug by the applicable regulatory authority 
benefits of orphan drug designation in the eu are similar to those in the us  but include ten years of marketing exclusivity in all member states  free scientific advice during drug development  access to a centralized review process and a reduction or complete waiver of fees levied by the european medicines agency 
approvals outside the united states 
other than applying for and receiving orphan drug designation for korlym for cushing s syndrome in the eu  we have not started the regulatory approval process in any jurisdiction other than the united states and we are unable to estimate when  if ever  we will commence the regulatory approval process in any foreign jurisdiction 
we or our potential future partners will have to complete an approval process similar to the us approval process in foreign target markets for our product candidates before we can commercialize our product candidates in those countries 
the approval procedure and the time required for approval vary from country to country and can involve additional testing 
foreign approvals may not be granted on a timely basis  or at all 
regulatory approval of pricing is required in most countries other than the united states 
the prices approved may be too low to generate an acceptable return to us 
fast track designation 
the fda sometimes grants fast track status under the food and drug administration modernization act of the fast track mechanism is intended to facilitate the development and approval of new drugs intended for the treatment of serious or life threatening diseases or conditions and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition 
the fast track process includes scheduling of meetings to seek fda input into development plans  the option of submitting an nda serially in sections rather than submitting all components simultaneously  the option to request evaluation of studies using surrogate endpoints  and the potential for a priority review 
we have been granted fast track status for mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
however  the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the fda at any time 
the fast track designation does not guarantee that we will qualify for or be able to take advantage of the expedited review procedures and does not increase the likelihood that mifepristone will receive regulatory approval 
priority review 
the fda has indicated to us that it will grant us a priority review of our nda of mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression if no other medications have been approved for this indication at the time of our submission

risk factors an investment in our common stock involves significant risks 
you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this annual report on form k  including our financial statements and related notes  before you decide to invest in our common stock 
if any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially harmed  the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment 
the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect us  however  they may not be the only ones that we face 
additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware or currently deem immaterial may also become important factors that may harm our business 
except as required by law  we undertake no obligations to update any risk factors 
risks related to the commercialization of korlym and development of mifepristone and our other proprietary gr ii antagonists we depend heavily on the success of korlym  which we only recently began to sell 
if we are unable to commercialize korlym successfully  or experience significant delays in doing so  we may not generate revenues as quickly as or at the levels that we or investors expect and our stock price will likely decline 
we anticipate that for the foreseeable future our ability to generate meaningful revenues and achieve profitability will be solely dependent on the successful commercialization of korlym 
many factors could harm our efforts to commercialize korlym  including an inability to generate meaningful revenue due to low product usage  inadequate coverage and reimbursement or other factors  competition from novartis s signifor and from other companies with greater financial  technical and marketing resources than ours 
an inability to manufacture korlym or the active ingredient in korlym in commercial quantities and at an acceptable cost  political concerns relating to other uses of mifepristone  or ru  that could limit the market acceptance of korlym  negative  inconclusive or otherwise unfavorable results from any post approval studies we conduct  previously unknown  serious side effects that may be identified  and rapid technological change making korlym obsolete 
even if we are able to commercialize korlym successfully  we cannot predict the rate at which success will occur 
as our current ability to generate revenue is wholly dependent upon the commercialization of korlym  its rate of sale will directly and materially affect our results of operations 
there are inherent difficulties in predicting the volumes of korlym that will be sold  which are heightened by our relative inexperience commercializing korlym or other products 
failure of our revenue to meet the expectations of investors could cause our stock price to decline 
see also the discussion below under the failure of our financial results to meet estimates published by research analysts or other investor expectations could cause our stock price to decline 
physicians may accept korlym slowly or may never accept it  which would adversely affect our financial results 
many factors may affect the market acceptance and commercial success of korlym 
even though the fda has approved korlym  physicians may not adopt it as a treatment for their eligible patients 
physicians will prescribe korlym only if they determine  based on experience  clinical data  side effect 
table of contents profiles and other factors  that it is preferable to other products or treatments currently in use  even if those products are not approved for cushing s syndrome 
because cushing s syndrome is rare  most physicians are inexperienced in the care of patients with the illness and it may be difficult to persuade them to prescribe a new treatment  such as korlym  even with clinical trial results that suggest that it may be a compelling treatment for them to consider 
other factors that may affect the market acceptance and commercial success of korlym include the effectiveness of korlym  including any side effects  as compared to alternative treatment methods  the rate of adoption of korlym by physicians and by target patient populations  the possible preference of some physicians for more familiar  long standing off label treatments for cushing s syndrome or for novartis drug  signifor  for the treatment of cushing s disease  the cost effectiveness of korlym and the availability of third party insurance coverage and reimbursement  in particular from government payors such as medicare and medicaid  for patients using korlym  the product labeling required by the fda for korlym  the extent and success of our efforts to manufacture  commercialize  market  distribute and sell korlym  and negative publicity concerning korlym  ru  mifeprex or mifepristone 
the failure of korlym to achieve market acceptance would prevent us from generating meaningful revenue 
the orphan drug designation for korlym may not provide protection from competition and other benefits as anticipated 
in july  we received orphan drug designation from the fda for korlym for the treatment of hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in adult patients with endogenous cushing s syndrome who have type diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and have failed surgery or are not candidates for surgery 
drugs that receive orphan drug designation are eligible to obtain seven years of marketing exclusivity for the approved indication from the date of drug approval  with limited exceptions  as well as tax credits for clinical trial costs  marketing application filing fee waivers and assistance from the fda in the drug development process 
in october  the european commission granted us orphan drug designation for korlym for the treatment of endogenous cushing s syndrome hypercortisolism in the eu 
benefits of orphan drug designation in the eu are similar to those in the united states  but include ten years of marketing exclusivity for the approved indication in all member states  free scientific advice during drug development  access to a centralized review process and a reduction or complete waiver of fees levied by the european medicines agency 
although we have received orphan drug designation in both the united states and the eu  we cannot be assured that we will recognize the potential benefits of these designations 
even after an orphan drug is approved for its orphan indication  the fda can subsequently approve a different drug for the same condition if the fda concludes that the later drug is safer  more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care 
in addition  the fda may  during the seven year orphan drug exclusivity period  approve the same drug for a different indication 
notwithstanding korlym s orphan status in both the united states and the eu  in novartis received approval in both jurisdictions to market its somatostatin analogue signifor for adult patients with cushing s disease a subset of cushing s syndrome that afflicts approximately percent of all cushing s syndrome patients for whom pituitary surgery is not an option or has not been curative 
novartis has substantially more resources and experience than corcept and may provide significant competition 

table of contents further  we are aware that laboratoire hra pharma has received orphan drug designation in the united states and the eu for the use of mifepristone to treat a subtype of cushing s syndrome and has begun a phase clinical trial in europe and the united states for this indication 
we are also aware that exelgyn laboratories  which operates as a subsidiary of medi challenge pty ltd  received orphan drug designation for cushing s syndrome in the eu  but it has stated that it has not yet conducted any clinical trials 
if another drug with mifepristone as its active ingredient is approved in the eu for cushing s syndrome before korlym  we will not receive the ten years of marketing exclusivity from the date of drug approval in the eu and other potential benefits 
any delay in our commercialization of korlym may have a negative impact on the revenue that we might be able to realize from the exclusivity provided during the applicable periods 
we will face competition from companies that attempt to develop mifepristone or other compounds for the treatment of cushing s syndrome  which could limit our future revenues from the commercialization of korlym and which could have a negative impact on future revenues from the commercialization of korlym for any indication 
these companies may have significantly more resources than we do 
we will experience competition from novartis  which has received approval in the united states and the eu to market signifor pasireotide  an injectable somatostatin analogue  for the treatment of adult patients with cushing s disease a subset of the patients with cushing s syndrome for whom pituitary surgery is not an option or has not been curative 
we expect novartis to begin promoting signifor in the united states 
in addition  we are aware that laboratoire hra pharma has begun a phase clinical trial in europe and the united states evaluating the use of mifepristone to treat a subtype of cushing s syndrome  and that exelgyn laboratories may be planning to develop a cushing s syndrome product  although it has stated that it has not conducted any clinical trials to date 
see also the discussion above under the orphan drug designation for korlym may not provide protection from competition and other benefits as anticipated 
if another product for treatment of cushing s syndrome or cushing s disease is approved for commercialization  our potential future revenue could be reduced 
if we are unable to continue to obtain acceptable prices or adequate coverage and reimbursement for korlym from third party payors  we will be unable to generate significant revenues 
there is significant uncertainty related to the availability of third party insurance coverage and reimbursement for newly approved medications 
the commercial success of our medications in both domestic and international markets depends on whether third party coverage and reimbursement is available for them 
government payors  including medicare and medicaid  health maintenance organizations and other third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new medicines  and  as a result  they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our medications 
our near term dependence on the commercial success of korlym makes us particularly susceptible to any such cost containment or reduction efforts 
accordingly  even though korlym has been approved for commercial sale  unless government and other third party payors continue to provide adequate and timely coverage and reimbursement  physicians may not prescribe it and patients may not purchase it 
in addition  meaningful delays in insurance coverage for individual patients may increase our costs and reduce our revenues 
further  we will need to obtain approvals from hospital formularies before korlym can be reimbursed for in patient treatment 
if we fail to obtain such approvals  this will reduce the level of revenues that we are able to attain 
in some foreign markets  pricing and profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals are subject to government control 
in the united states  we expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals for similar controls 
also  the trends toward managed health care in the united states and recent laws and legislation intended to reduce the cost of government insurance programs could significantly influence the purchase of health care services and products and may result in lower prices for our products or the exclusion of such products from reimbursement programs 

table of contents in march  the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act  collectively referred to as the ppaca  was passed 
the ppaca included  among other things  the following measures annual  non deductible fees on any entity that manufactures or imports certain prescription drugs and biologics  increases in medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the medicaid drug rebate program for both branded and generic drugs  a new patient centered outcomes research institute to oversee  identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical research  new requirements for manufacturers to discount drug prices to eligible patients by percent at the pharmacy level and for mail order services in order for their outpatient drugs to be covered under medicare part d  an increase in the number of entities eligible for discounts under the public health service pharmaceutical pricing program  and establishment of a licensure framework for follow on biologic products 
the ppaca provisions on comparative clinical effectiveness research extended the initiatives of the american recovery and reinvestment act of  also known as the stimulus package  which included billion in funding to study the comparative effectiveness of health care treatments 
this stimulus funding was designated for  among other things  conducting  supporting or synthesizing research that compares and evaluates the risks and benefits  clinical outcomes  effectiveness and appropriateness of products 
the ppaca also appropriated additional funding to comparative clinical effectiveness research 
although congress has indicated that this funding is intended to improve the quality of health care  it remains unclear how the research will impact current medicare coverage and reimbursement or how new information will influence other third party payor policies 
since its passage  a number of state governors have strenuously opposed the mandatory purchase of insurance  referred to as the individual mandate  and aspects of voluntary medicaid expansion under ppaca  and initiated lawsuits challenging its constitutionality 
on june   the united states supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the individual mandate  and invalidated requirements that states forfeit certain federal funding if they do not expand medicaid coverage as prescribed by ppaca 
the court left the remainder of ppaca intact 
in addition  other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the united states since the ppaca was enacted 
most recently  on august   the budget control act of among other things  created the joint select committee on deficit reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to congress 
the joint select committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least trillion for the years through  triggering the legislation s automatic reduction to several government programs 
this includes aggregate reductions to medicare payments to providers of up to percent per fiscal year  starting in on january   president obama signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of  or the atra  which  among other things  delayed for another two months the budget cuts mandated by these sequestration provisions of the budget control act of the atra also reduced medicare payments to several providers  including hospitals  imaging centers and cancer treatment centers  and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years 
these new laws may result in additional reductions in medicare and other health care funding  which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and accordingly  our financial operations 
these new laws and the regulations and policies implementing them  as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future  may have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our products 

table of contents we will need to continue to develop our medical education  sales and marketing capabilities to successfully commercialize korlym and our other proprietary  selective gr ii antagonists 
to achieve commercial success for any approved product  we must either develop sales and marketing capabilities internally or enter into arrangements with third parties to market and sell our current and future products  and we may not be successful in doing so 
we continue to hire experienced field and internal personnel to commercialize korlym in the united states  which is expensive and time consuming 
although we received approval to market and sell korlym in february  our efforts to staff  deploy and train a marketing and medical education organization remain in an early stage 
any failure or delay in the development or failure to maintain effectively our internal capabilities for the marketing and sales of korlym would adversely impact the commercialization of the product 
if our efforts to develop an internal commercial marketing and sales team are not successful  cost effective and timely  we may not achieve profitability 
we will need to increase the size of our organization  and we may experience difficulties in managing growth 
we expect that the development of our commercial organization and the likely future expansion of our research and development efforts will strain our administrative  operational and management resources 
future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management  including the need to identify  recruit  maintain and integrate additional employees 
to date  we have relied on a small management team  including a number of part time contributors 
our future financial performance and our ability to compete effectively will depend  in part  on our ability to manage any future growth effectively 
to that end  we must be able to integrate additional management  clinical development  administrative and sales and marketing personnel  expand the size and composition of our management team  develop our administrative  accounting and management information systems and controls  hire and train additional qualified personnel  manage our sales and marketing efforts effectively  maintain our supply chain effectively  manage our clinical trials effectively  and manage our research and development efforts effectively 
we may not be able to accomplish these tasks  and our failure to accomplish any of them could harm our business 
public perception of the active ingredient in korlym  mifepristone also known as ru  may limit our ability to market and sell korlym 
the active ingredient in korlym  mifepristone ru  is approved by the fda in another drug for the termination of early pregnancy 
as a result  mifepristone has been and continues to be the subject of considerable ethical and political debate in the united states and elsewhere 
public perception of mifepristone may limit our ability to engage alternative manufacturers and may limit the commercial acceptance of korlym by patients and physicians 
even though we have taken measures to minimize the likelihood of the prescribing of korlym to a pregnant woman  physicians may choose not to prescribe korlym to a woman simply to avoid any risk of unintentionally terminating a pregnancy 
we have taken measures to control the distribution of korlym to reduce the potential for diversion and this controlled distribution may negatively impact sales of korlym 

table of contents we have no manufacturing capabilities and we currently depend on third parties to manufacture the active ingredient and the tablets for korlym  both of which are single source suppliers 
if these suppliers are unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing korlym and we are unable to contract quickly with alternative sources  or if these third party manufacturers fail to comply with fda regulations or otherwise fail to meet our requirements  our business will be harmed 
we currently have no experience in  and we do not own facilities for  nor do we plan to develop facilities for  manufacturing any products 
we depend on third party contract manufacturers to supply the active pharmaceutical ingredient  or api  in korlym and to manufacture the korlym tablet 
in addition  we expect to use third party manufacturers and suppliers if and when our product candidates are approved 
the facilities used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture our products must be approved by the fda pursuant to inspections 
we do not control the manufacturing processes of  and are completely dependent on  our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with the regulatory requirements  known as current good manufacturing practices  or cgmps 
if our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the fda or others  they will not be able to secure and or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities 
in addition  we have no control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control  quality assurance and qualified personnel 
if the fda or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our products or if it withdraws any such approval in the future  we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities  which would significantly impact our ability to develop  obtain regulatory approval for or market our products 
in addition  sanctions could be imposed on us  including fines  injunctions  civil penalties  failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our product candidates  delays  suspension or withdrawal of approvals  seizures or recalls of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions  any of which could harm our business 
we have only one approved manufacturer of the api in korlym  with whom our agreement expires in june we intend to continue the relationship and are in the process of negotiating a new agreement 
we have a memorandum of understanding with a second api manufacturer 
however  there are no activities currently being conducted at this second manufacturer s site to develop or qualify the manufacturing processes or facilities and we did not request approval of material produced by this second manufacturer when we submitted our nda for cushing s syndrome 
we have an agreement with a tablet manufacturer that we included in our nda submission for korlym 
this tablet manufacturer has temporarily suspended commercial production while it relocates to  and seeks regulatory approval to begin operation of  a new facility 
on november   the fda approved our second korlym tablet manufacturer as a qualified site for the manufacture of korlym tablets  with whom we are now negotiating a commercial supply agreement 
we cannot assure you that our tablet suppliers will be able or willing to meet our future demands 
if our original tablet manufacturer is not able to qualify its new site or if our second korlym tablet manufacturer is unable to prepare korlym tablets in the quantities and time frame required  we may not be able to manufacture our product in a timely manner 
if our suppliers were to fail to manufacture tablets on a timely basis in the quantities that we require  or fail to maintain manufacturing capabilities that meet fda standards  we would likely experience a lengthy delay in our manufacturing processes 
our current arrangements with these manufacturers are terminable by such manufacturers 
if we are unable  for whatever reason  to obtain the api or korlym tablets from our contract manufacturers  we may not be able to manufacture our required quantities or identify alternate manufacturers of mifepristone or korlym tablets in a timely manner or on reasonable terms  if at all  which would harm our business 

table of contents if we or others identify previously unknown  serious side effects of mifepristone  we may be required to perform lengthy additional clinical trials  change the labeling of korlym or withdraw it from the market  any of which would hinder or preclude our ability to generate revenues 
the fda s approval of korlym requires that we conduct a study of the interactions between korlym and ketoconazole  an anti fungal agent sometimes used to treat patients with cushing s syndrome 
it also requires us to study drug utilization to better characterize the reporting rates of adverse events associated with the long term use of korlym 
if we or others identify previously unknown  serious side effects of mifepristone regulatory authorities may withdraw their approvals  we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials  make changes in labeling  implement changes to or obtain re approvals of our manufacturing facilities  we may experience a significant drop in the sales of korlym  our reputation in the marketplace may suffer  and we may become the target of lawsuits  including class action lawsuits 
any of these events could harm or prevent sales of the affected products or could increase the costs and expenses of commercializing and marketing korlym 
we may have substantial exposure to product liability claims and may not have adequate insurance to cover those claims 
we may be subject to product liability or other claims based on allegations that the use of our products has resulted in adverse effects or that our product candidates are not effective  whether by participants in our clinical trials for korlym or other product candidates  or by patients using korlym 
a product liability claim may damage our reputation by raising questions about korlym or any of our product candidates safety or efficacy and could limit our ability to sell a product by preventing or interfering with product commercialization 
in some cases  less common adverse effects of a pharmaceutical product are not known until long after the fda approves the product for marketing 
the active ingredient in korlym is used to terminate pregnancy 
therefore  clinicians using the medicine in our clinical trials and physicians prescribing the medicine to women with childbearing potential must take necessary and strict precautions to ensure that the medicine is not administered to pregnant women 
the failure to observe these precautions could result in significant product claims 
we have only limited product liability insurance coverage  with limits that we believe to be customary for a company beginning to commercialize its first pharmaceutical product 
we intend to expand our product liability insurance coverage to any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval 
however  this insurance may be prohibitively expensive or may not fully cover our potential liabilities 
our inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of korlym or any of our product candidates  or result in meaningful underinsured or uninsured liability 
defending a lawsuit could be costly and significantly divert management s attention from conducting our business 
if a third party successfully sues us for any injury caused by our product candidates  our liability could exceed our total assets 
even if we receive regulatory approval for our product candidates  we will be subject to ongoing and continued regulatory review  and if we are unable to maintain regulatory approval of korlym  or if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements  we will be unable to generate revenue or may be subject to penalties and our business will be harmed 
even after we obtain us regulatory approval for a product  the fda may still impose significant restrictions on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or on the conditions of approval 
for example  a product s approval may contain requirements for potentially costly post approval studies and surveillance  including phase clinical trials  to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product 
the 
table of contents fda s approval of korlym was subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed and requirements for post marketing follow up studies and information reporting 
in addition  the fda s approval of korlym requires that we conduct a study of the interactions between korlym and ketoconazole  an anti fungal agent sometimes used to treat patients with cushing s syndrome 
it also requires us to conduct a drug utilization study to better characterize the reporting rates of adverse events associated with the long term use of korlym 
we will also be subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review by the fda and other regulatory authorities in the united states and other countries with respect to the research  testing  manufacturing  labeling  distribution  adverse event reporting  storage  selling  advertising  promotion  recordkeeping and marketing of products 
these requirements include submissions of safety and other post marketing information and reports  annual updates on manufacturing activities and continued compliance with cgmps and cgcps for any clinical trials that we conduct post approval 
later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product  including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency  or with our third party manufacturers or manufacturing processes  or failure to comply with fda regulations and other applicable foreign and us regulatory requirements may result in  among other things  warning letters  civil and criminal penalties  injunctions  holds on clinical trials  product seizure or detention  refusal to permit the import or export of products  restrictions on product marketing  withdrawal of the product from the market  voluntary or mandatory product recalls  total or partial suspension of production  refusal to approve pending ndas or supplements to approved ndas  and suspension or revocation of product approvals 
the fda s policies may change and additional governmental regulations may be enacted that could prevent  limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates 
if we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies  or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance  we may place at risk any marketing approval that we may have obtained  which would adversely affect our business  prospects and ability to achieve or sustain profitability 
the sale of our products is subject to regulatory approvals  and our business is subject to extensive regulatory requirements  and if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for future product candidates  including mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression  we will be limited in our ability to commercialize such product candidates and our business will be harmed 
we are not permitted to market or promote any of our product candidates before we receive regulatory approval from the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities  and we may never receive such regulatory approval for any of our product candidates 
obtaining regulatory approval of a new drug is an uncertain  lengthy and expensive process  and success is never guaranteed 
despite the time  resources and effort expended  failure can occur at any stage 
in order to receive approval from the fda for each product candidate  we must demonstrate that the new drug product is safe and effective for its intended use and that our manufacturing processes for the product candidate comply with the fda s cgmps 
cgmps include requirements related to production processes  quality control and assurance  and recordkeeping 
the fda has substantial discretion in the approval process for human medicines 
the fda may require substantial additional clinical testing or find our drug products do not satisfy the standards for approval 
our inability or the inability of our suppliers to comply with applicable fda and other regulatory requirements can result in  among other things  delays in or denials of new product approvals  warning letters  fines  consent decrees restricting or suspending manufacturing operations  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of sales  and or criminal prosecution 
any of these or other regulatory actions could materially adversely affect our business and our financial condition 
future governmental action or changes in fda law  policy or personnel may also result in delays or rejection of an nda in the united states 
in addition  because the only other currently fda approved use of mifepristone is the termination of pregnancy  we expect that the label for mifepristone for any indication will include  as korlym s does  some limitations  including a so called black box warning that it should not be used by pregnant women or women seeking to become pregnant 

table of contents if we receive regulatory approval for our future product candidates  including mifepristone for the treatment of psychotic depression  we will be subject to ongoing fda obligations and continued regulatory oversight and review  such as continued safety reporting requirements  and we may also be subject to additional fda post marketing restrictions and obligations  such as a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy 
if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance  we may not be permitted to market our product candidates and or may be subject to product recalls or seizures 
any regulatory approvals that we receive for our future product candidates may also be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the medicine may be marketed or contain requirements for potentially costly post marketing follow up studies 
in addition  if the fda approves any of our product candidates  we will be subject to ongoing and continuing regulatory requirements 
see also the discussion above under even if we receive regulatory approval for our product candidates  we will be subject to ongoing and continued regulatory review  and if we are unable to maintain regulatory approval of korlym  or if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements  we will be unable to generate revenue or may be subject to penalties and our business will be harmed 
if we market products in a manner that violates fda regulations or health care fraud and abuse laws  we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties 
in the united states  we are subject to fda regulations governing the promotion of health care products 
although physicians are permitted  based on their medical judgment  to prescribe drugs for indications other than those approved by the fda  manufacturers are prohibited from promoting their products for such off label uses 
in the united states  we are marketing korlym for treatment of hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in adult patients with endogenous cushing s syndrome who have type diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and have failed surgery or are not candidates for surgery and provide promotional materials and training programs to physicians regarding the use of korlym for this indication 
although we believe our marketing materials and training programs for physicians do not constitute off label promotion of korlym  the fda may disagree 
if the fda determines that our promotional materials  training or other activities by our employees or agents constitute off label promotion of korlym  it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or other activities or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions  including the issuance of a warning letter  injunction  seizure  civil fine and criminal penalties 
it is also possible that other federal or state enforcement authorities might take action if they believe that the alleged improper promotion led to the submission and payment of claims for an unapproved use  which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities  such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement 
even if it is later determined that we are not in violation of these laws  we may be faced with negative publicity  incur significant expenses defending our position and have to divert significant management resources from other matters 
in addition  there are health care fraud and abuse regulations and enforcement by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business 
the laws that may affect our ability to operate include the federal health care programs anti kickback statute  which prohibits  among other things  persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting  receiving  offering or paying remuneration  directly or indirectly  in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for  or the purchase  order or recommendation of  any good or service for which payment may be made under federal health care programs such as the medicare and medicaid programs  federal false claims laws  which prohibit any person from knowingly presenting  or causing to be presented  a false claim for payment to the federal government  or knowingly making  or causing to be made  a false statement to get a false claim paid 
pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of promotional and marketing activities  such as allegedly providing free product to or entering into sham consulting arrangements with customers to induce such customers to purchase  order or recommend the company s products in violation of the anti kickback statute and 
table of contents federal false claims laws and regulations  reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by certain governmental programs to set reimbursement rates  engaging in the promotion of off label uses that caused customers to submit claims to and obtain reimbursement from governmental payors for non covered off label uses  and submitting inflated best price information to the medicaid drug rebate program  the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa  which created federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements relating to health care matters  federal sunshine laws that require transparency regarding financial arrangements with health care providers  such as the reporting and disclosure requirements imposed by the ppaca on drug manufacturers regarding any transfer of value made or distributed to prescribers and other health care providers 
manufacturers will be required to begin data collection on august  and report such data to the centers for medicare and medicaid services known as cms by march   and state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws  such as anti kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third party payor  including commercial insurers 
some states  such as california  massachusetts  minnesota  nevada  vermont and washington  as well as the district of columbia  mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs to ensure compliance with these laws 
the risk of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts  and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations 
moreover  recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws 
for example  the ppaca  among other things  amended the intent requirement of the federal anti kickback and criminal health care fraud statutes  a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them 
in addition  the ppaca provided that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes 
if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us  we may be subject to penalties  including civil and criminal penalties  damages  fines  exclusion from governmental health care programs  and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations  any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results 
clinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome  and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results 
clinical development is a long  expensive and uncertain process  and data obtained from clinical trials and supportive studies are susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
the results from early clinical trials may not be predictive of results to be obtained in later clinical trials 
product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials 
a number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles  notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials 
clinical trials may not demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals or a commercially viable product 
to gain regulatory approval from the fda to market mifepristone for the psychotic features of psychotic depression  our ongoing phase clinical trial must demonstrate the safety and efficacy of mifepristone for that indication 
the ongoing phase clinical trial of mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression may not demonstrate efficacy or safety results sufficient for approval  and we may need to conduct other studies in support of a potential nda in that indication 
if our ongoing phase clinical trial is not 
table of contents completed or conducted as planned or if mifepristone does not prove to be safe and effective or does not receive required regulatory approvals  the commercialization of mifepristone for the psychotic features of psychotic depression would be delayed or prevented  and our ability to generate revenues would be impaired 
moreover  the commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed by many factors that are beyond our control  including delays obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial  reaching agreement on acceptable terms with contract research organizations  or cros  and clinical trial sites  obtaining institutional review board  or irb  approval at each site  slower than anticipated patient enrollment  scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions  lack of funding  negative or inconclusive results  patient noncompliance with the protocol  adverse medical events or side effects among patients during the clinical trials  negative or problematic fda inspections of our clinical operations or manufacturing operations  and real or perceived lack of effectiveness or safety of mifepristone 
we could encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us  the irbs of the clinical trial sites in which such trials are being conducted  by the data safety monitoring board  or dsmb  for such trial or by the fda or other regulatory authorities 
such authorities may impose such a suspension or termination due to a number of factors  including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols  inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the fda or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold  unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects  failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug  changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial 
we may decide  or the fda or other regulatory authorities may require us  to pursue additional clinical or preclinical studies on mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
additional trials or studies may require additional funding  the availability of which is not assured 
also  it is possible that additional trials or studies that we decide are necessary or desirable will delay or prevent the completion of the development of mifepristone for treating the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
even if we are able to conduct all of the clinical trials and supportive studies that we consider appropriate for an optimal nda  we may never receive regulatory approval to market mifepristone for psychotic depression 
our use of medavante to provide centralized psychiatric rating services in study  our ongoing clinical trial evaluating mifepristone for the psychotic features of psychotic depression  may not result in any improvement in the accuracy and consistency of the psychiatric assessments and may continue to slow the pace of enrollment in study in connection with our ongoing phase trial evaluating mifepristone for the psychotic features of psychotic depression  study  we engaged medavante to provide centralized psychiatric rating services 
medavante is providing centralized psychometric assessments via high resolution video conferencing 
the use of medavante s centralized rating services is intended to increase the accuracy and consistency of the psychiatric assessments 

table of contents medavante has provided similar centralized rating services to companies conducting clinical studies in various psychiatric disorders 
however  they have not previously provided centralized rating services to any study in patients with psychotic depression 
although we and medavante conducted a small pilot evaluation in patients with psychotic depression to assess patient receptivity  we cannot be certain that centralized rating will be successful with the patients enrolled in our study 
if patients are uncomfortable or unwilling to participate in the centralized rating process or if medavante is unable to provide services in a satisfactory manner over the course of the trial  we may not see any improvement in the accuracy or reliability of the psychiatric assessments 
such a result might diminish the likelihood of a successful trial or a definitive demonstration of the efficacy of mifepristone in treating the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
during screening for study  there has been a higher than anticipated incidence of potential patients who do not meet appropriate criteria for entrance into the trial for diagnostic and other clinical reasons 
although we believe that this is the result of improved accuracy in the screening process resulting from the use of the medavante centralized rating services as an additional step in the selection of patients appropriate for inclusion in the study  medavante s diagnostic screening may not actually improve trial performance 
in addition  in mid  in order to lower expenses and to conserve financial resources  we scaled back our planned rate of spending on this trial and extended the timeline for its completion 
our current plan is to increase the number of clinical sites from eight to approximately  which will increase our rate of spending on the trial  with an unknown effect on the likelihood of success 
in order to meet our goal of enrolling a sufficient number of patients in study by the end of to perform a successful interim analysis  we will need to increase the pace of enrollment which will be costly and may not be successful 
the pace of enrollment in study is subject to a number of factors  including our ability to identify  qualify and enlist new trial sites  our ability to identify potential study subjects and enroll them in the trial  and the ability and willingness of patients in the trial to complete the study protocol 
furthermore  we will need to work with our existing third party service providers and may need to retain additional personnel to support our effort to increase the rate of study enrollment  which will be costly  and we may not be successful in these efforts 
finally  even if we succeed in increasing the rate of enrollment in study  this will not necessarily allow us to demonstrate the efficacy of the medicine 
if we conduct an interim analysis of the data from our on going phase trial of mifepristone for the treatment of psychotic depression trial  the results may not show efficacy 
if the interim results are inconclusive and we continue the study  conducting an interim analysis will make achieving a positive result more difficult 
one of our goals is to enroll a sufficient number of patients in trial by the end of so that we can  if we choose  perform an interim analysis of the study s data 
we have not yet determined whether we will perform such an analysis or what its parameters might be 
regardless of how many patients we enroll in trial by the end of  there can be no assurance that an interim analysis will take place 
even if we reach our patient enrollment goal and choose to perform an interim analysis  its results may be negative or inconclusive 
if they are negative  then we will terminate the trial and either incur the substantial additional expense and delay of undertaking a new trial  or discontinue the study of mifepristone for the psychotic features of psychotic depression  which may reduce our future revenue 
if the results are inconclusive  and we choose to continue the trial  we will incur additional expense and delay the possibility of our obtaining regulatory approval of a treatment for this disease 
in addition  performing an interim analysis makes the measure of statistical significance in any continued trial more rigorous and more difficult to meet 
therefore  a continued trial following an interim analysis is generally less likely to achieve a statistically meaningful positive outcome  making it more difficult to achieve a positive result 

table of contents we depend on third parties to conduct and manage many of our clinical trials and to perform related data collection and analysis and  if these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected timelines  we may face costs and delays that may prevent or delay us from obtaining regulatory approval for or commercializing our product candidates  which could substantially harm our business 
we rely on clinical investigators and clinical sites to enroll patients and other third parties such as clinical research organizations  or cros  to manage many of our trials and to perform related data collection and analysis 
we control only certain aspects of these third parties activities 
nevertheless  we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol  legal  regulatory and scientific standards  and our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities 
we and these third parties are required to comply with current good clinical practices  or cgcp  which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the fda and comparable foreign regulatory authorities through periodic inspections of trial sponsors  clinical investigators and clinical sites 
if we or any of the third parties working on or conducting our trials fail to comply with applicable cgcps  the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approval of our marketing applications  if at all 
we cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority  such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials complies with cgcp requirements 
in addition  our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cgmp regulations 
our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials  which would delay the regulatory approval process 
moreover  we may not be able to control the timing of identification and selection of appropriate sites for our planned trials and the amount and timing of resources that the clinical sites that conduct the clinical testing may devote to our clinical trials 
if our clinical investigators and clinical sites fail to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials or fail to enroll them on our planned schedules  we will be unable to complete our trials or to complete them as planned  which could delay or prevent us from completing the clinical development of mifepristone for the psychotic features of psychotic depression or other development programs 
we have an agreement with a cro that is conducting our ongoing phase trial evaluating mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression study to supervise and monitor clinical site performance and to perform investigator supervision  data collection and analysis for this trial 
the conduct of future clinical trials may also be conducted through the use of cros and third party clinical sites 
we may not be able to maintain relationships with this or other cros or with the clinical investigators and the clinical sites through the completion of all trial activities without delays in anticipated timing of trial activities or excessive expenditures 
if any of our relationships with cros or other third parties terminates  we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative cros or third parties on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
if these cros  clinical investigators  clinical sites or other third parties do not carry out their contractual duties or obligations or fail to meet expected deadlines  or if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons  our clinical trials may be extended  delayed or terminated and we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for  or successfully commercialize  mifepristone for the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
failure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions will prevent us from commercializing korlym and our other product candidates abroad 
we may seek to commercialize our products and product candidates in international markets with the help of one or more partners or on our own 
outside the united states  we may commercialize a product only if we receive a marketing authorization and  in many cases  pricing approval  from the appropriate regulatory authorities  whose approval processes include all of the risks associated with the fda approval process  and  in some cases  additional risks 
the approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing  and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain fda approval 
other than seeking and receiving orphan drug designation in the eu  we have not taken any actions to obtain foreign approvals 
we may not develop our product candidates in the clinic in order to obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis  if at all 

table of contents approval by the fda does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries  and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the fda  but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others 
we may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our product candidates in any foreign market 
the fast track designation for the development program of mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process 
if a human medicine is intended for the treatment of a serious or life threatening disease or condition and the medicine demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this disease or condition  the sponsor of an ind may apply for fda fast track designation for a particular indication 
marketing applications submitted by sponsors of product candidates in fast track development may qualify for expedited fda review under the policies and procedures offered by the fda  but the fast track designation does not assure any such qualification 
although we have obtained a fast track designation from the fda for mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression  we may not experience a faster development process  review or approval compared to applications considered for approval under conventional fda procedures 
in addition  the fda may withdraw our fast track designation at any time 
if we lose our fast track designation  the approval process may be delayed 
in addition  our fast track designation does not guarantee that we will qualify for or be able to take advantage of the expedited review procedures and does not increase the likelihood that mifepristone will receive regulatory approval for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
we face competition from companies with substantial financial  technical and marketing resources  which could limit our future revenues from the commercialization of mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression or for other indications 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change 
if approved for commercial use as a treatment for the psychotic features of psychotic depression  mifepristone will compete with established treatments  including ect and combination medicinal therapy 
combination medicinal therapy consists of the use of antipsychotic and antidepressant medicines not currently approved for the treatment of psychotic depression 
the antipsychotics are prescribed by physicians for off label use to treat the psychotic features of psychotic depression  which is the clinical target of mifepristone 
antipsychotics include abilify bristol myers squibb  clozaril novartis  geodon and navane pfizer  haldol ortho mcneil  mellaril mylan  risperdal janssen pharmaceuticals  seroquel astrazeneca  stelazine and thorazine glaxosmithkline and zyprexa eli lilly 
mifepristone may not compete effectively with these established treatments 
we are aware of one clinical trial conducted by organon  for a new chemical entity for the treatment of psychotic depression 
organon was the pharmaceutical division of akzo nobel  which was purchased by schering plough which was then subsequently acquired by merck co 
organon s new chemical entity is a gr ii antagonist  we believe that its commercial use would be covered by our patent 
our present and potential competitors include major pharmaceutical companies such as the makers of the drugs identified above  as well as specialized pharmaceutical firms  universities and public and private research institutions 
moreover  we expect competition to intensify as technical advances are made 
these competitors  either alone or with collaborative parties  may succeed with the development and commercialization of medicinal products that are superior to and more cost effective than mifepristone 
many of our competitors and related private and public research and academic institutions have greater experience  more financial and marketing resources and larger research and development staffs than we do 
in addition  many of these competitors  either alone or together with their collaborative partners  have significantly greater experience than we do in developing human medicines  obtaining regulatory approvals  manufacturing and commercializing products 

table of contents accordingly  mifepristone may not be an effective competitor against established treatments and our present or potential competitors may succeed in developing medicinal products that are superior to mifepristone or render mifepristone obsolete or non competitive 
if we are unable to establish mifepristone as a superior and cost effective treatment for the psychotic features of psychotic depression  or any future use  we may be unable to generate the revenues necessary to support our business 
our efforts to discover  develop and commercialize new product candidates beyond mifepristone are at a very early stage 
if we fail to identify and develop additional uses for gr ii antagonists  we may be unable to market additional products 
to develop additional potential sources of revenue  we believe that we must identify and develop additional product candidates 
we own or have exclusively licensed issued us patents covering the use of gr ii antagonists to treat psychotic depression  mild cognitive impairment  weight gain due to treatment with antipsychotic medication  stress disorders  early dementia  delirium  gastroesophageal reflux disease  down s syndrome  catatonia and psychosis associated with cocaine addiction  and to increase the therapeutic response to electroconvulsive therapy ect 
in addition  we have nine us method of use patent applications covering gr ii antagonists for the treatment of a number of other metabolic and psychiatric disorders  three us composition of matter patents covering specific gr ii antagonists  and two additional us composition of matter patents are pending 
we have also filed patent applications in the major international markets 
the use of gr ii antagonists may not be effective to treat these conditions or any other indications 
moreover  we could discover that the use of gr ii antagonists in these patient populations has unacceptable side effects or is otherwise not safe 
due to the risks of efficacy and side effects inherent in developing novel compounds  we are likely to enter multiple compounds into development  which would increase our rate of spending with no assurance that we will be successful in developing new drugs that are safe and effective 
in addition  we may not develop or continue to develop product candidates for any of the indications or compounds covered by our patents and patent applications 
typically  there is a high rate of attrition for product candidates in preclinical and clinical trials  and our product development efforts may not lead to commercially viable products 
we may elect to enter into collaboration arrangements with respect to one or more of our product candidates 
if we do enter into such an arrangement  we would be dependent on a collaborative partner for the success of the product candidates developed under the arrangement 
any future collaborative partner may fail to successfully develop or commercialize a product candidate under a collaborative arrangement 
we only have significant clinical experience with mifepristone and we may determine that mifepristone is not desirable for uses other than for the treatment of hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in adult patients with endogenous cushing s syndrome who have type diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and have failed surgery or are not candidates for surgery and  potentially  for the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
for example  we do not intend to develop mifepristone for mitigation of the weight gain associated with the use of zyprexa  risperdal or other atypical antipsychotics  even though we have reported positive results in the proof of concept studies described in part i  item  business overview mifepristone proof of concept studies  other metabolic disorders of our annual report on form k for the year ended december  we are pursuing other gr ii antagonists for this use 
the compounds developed pursuant to our early clinical  preclinical and discovery research programs  including cort  may fail to become viable product candidates regardless of the resources we may dedicate to the program 
even if product candidates are identified  we may abandon further development efforts before we reach clinical trials or after expending significant expense and time conducting clinical trials due to financial constraints  concerns over the safety or efficacy of the product candidates  manufacturing difficulties or other reasons 
moreover  governmental authorities may enact new legislation or regulations that could limit or restrict our development efforts 
if we are unable to successfully discover and commercialize new uses for gr ii antagonists  we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to support our operations 

table of contents if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional skilled personnel  we may be unable to pursue our product development and commercialization efforts 
our ability to operate successfully and manage our potential future growth depends significantly upon retaining key research  technical  sales  marketing  managerial and financial personnel  and attracting and retaining additional highly qualified personnel in these areas 
we depend substantially on the principal members of our management and scientific staff 
we do not have agreements with any of our executive officers that provide for their continued employment with us or employment insurance covering any of our key personnel 
any officer or employee can terminate his or her relationship with us at any time and work for one of our competitors 
the loss of these key individuals could result in competitive harm because we could experience delays in our product research  development and commercialization efforts without their expertise 
we face intense competition for qualified personnel from numerous companies  as well as universities and nonprofit research organizations in the highly competitive san francisco bay area 
although we believe that we have been successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to date  we may not be able to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel in the future 
the inability to attract and retain these personnel could result in delays in the research  development and commercialization of our potential products 
rapid technological change could make our product candidates obsolete 
pharmaceutical technologies have undergone rapid and significant change and we expect that they will continue to do so 
our future will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to these technologies 
any products and processes that we develop may become obsolete or uneconomical before we recover any or all expenses incurred in connection with their development 
rapid technological change could make our product candidates obsolete or uneconomical  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the occurrence of a catastrophic disaster or other similar events could cause damage to our own or our manufacturers facilities and equipment  which could require us to cease or curtail operations 
because our executive offices are located in the san francisco bay area and some of our current manufacturers are also located in earthquake prone areas  our business is vulnerable to damage from various types of disasters or other similarly disruptive events  including earthquake  fire  flood  power loss and communications failures 
in addition  political considerations relating to mifepristone may put us and our manufacturers at increased risk for terrorist attacks  protests or other disruptive events 
if any disaster or other similar event were to occur  we may not be able to operate our business and our manufacturers may not be able to produce our product candidates 
our insurance may not be adequate to cover  and our insurance policies may exclude coverage for  our losses resulting from disasters or other business interruptions 
we rely significantly on information technology and any failure  inadequacy  interruption or security lapse of that technology  including any cyber security incidents  could harm our ability to operate our business effectively 
despite the implementation of security measures  our internal computer systems and those of third parties with which we contract are vulnerable to damage from cyber attacks  computer viruses  unauthorized access  natural disasters  terrorism  war and telecommunication and electrical failures 
system failures  accidents or security breaches could cause interruptions in our operations  and could result in a material disruption of our clinical and commercialization activities and business operations  in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy 
the loss of clinical trial data could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data 
to the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of  or damage to  our data or applications  or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information  we could incur liability and our product research  development and commercialization efforts could be delayed 

table of contents risks related to our capital needs and financial results we may need additional capital in order to complete the development and commercialization of our proprietary  selective gr ii antagonists 
additional capital may not be available to us at all or on favorable terms  which could adversely affect our business 
we may have to perform more clinical trials  in addition to our ongoing phase trial  prior to submitting an nda for mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
if so  we may need to raise additional funds to complete the development of mifepristone for that indication 
in addition  we may need to raise additional funds to continue and expand the development of our proprietary  selective gr ii antagonists in various indications 
we may also raise additional funds for other research and development activities  including clinical trials  and working capital and for other general corporate purposes  or to acquire or invest in businesses  products and technologies that are complementary to our own 
factors impacting our cash position and future prospects of liquidity include the following the amount and timing of revenues from the commercialization of korlym  the pace at which physicians adopt korlym as a treatment  the willingness of insurance companies  the government and other third party payors to provide coverage for korlym at reasonable rates  changes in the coverage and reimbursement policies of third party insurance companies or government agencies  the costs  timing of site selection and enrollment of our clinical trials  the results of our research efforts and clinical trials  the need to perform additional clinical trials and other supportive studies  the timing of the submission of an nda to the fda  the acceptance of the nda submission  and the outcome of the fda approval process for the marketing of mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression  the timing of commercialization of mifepristone for the treatment of psychotic depression  developments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights  including announcements of claims of infringement  interference or litigation against us or our licensors  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  changes in our growth rates  and changes in our research and development plans for our proprietary  selective gr ii antagonists 
consequently  we may need additional funding sooner than anticipated 
in addition  we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current and future operating plans 
we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
even though we have raised funds a number of times in the past  market and economic conditions may make it difficult for us to raise any or sufficient additional capital 
our sales of common stock and warrants and the exercises of warrants have been dilutive to stockholders and any exercise of outstanding warrants and additional equity financing could cause further dilution to stockholders 
debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
if we obtain funds through collaborations with others  these arrangements may be on unfavorable terms or may require us to relinquish certain rights to korlym  our technologies or product candidates  which we would otherwise seek to develop on our own 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or we may be required to discontinue operations 

table of contents we have incurred losses since inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for at least the next few years 
we have a limited history of operations and have focused primarily on clinical trials 
we have begun to commercialize korlym and  if the outcome of our clinical trials supports it  we plan to seek fda regulatory clearance to market mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
historically  we have funded our operations primarily from the sale of our equity securities 
we have incurred losses in each year since our inception in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we only began to sell our first commercial product  korlym  in the united states in april based on this limited experience marketing korlym  it is difficult for us to predict the magnitude or timing of future product sales 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase in connection with the clinical trials and other development activities for mifepristone for the psychotic features of psychotic depression and for other product candidates 
we expect to incur significant expenses related to commercializing korlym 
as a result  we expect that our losses will increase at least until korlym is generating material amounts of revenue 
we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or whether or when we will become profitable 
we may not be able to pursue all of our product research and development opportunities if we are unable to generate sufficient revenue or secure adequate funding for these programs 
the costs required to start or continue many of the programs that our intellectual property allows us to consider for further development are collectively greater than the funds currently available to us 
for example  we have successfully discovered three series of compounds that are selective gr ii antagonists but  unlike mifepristone  do not appear to block the progesterone receptor 
further development of these proprietary compounds or any further development stemming from our method of use patents may be delayed or cancelled if we determine that such development may jeopardize our ability to complete the clinical development of mifepristone for the treatment of psychotic depression 
global economic conditions could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 
in the united states and globally  market and economic conditions have been volatile over the past few years  with significantly tighter credit conditions in the markets in which we conduct our operations 
the us and global economies have experienced a recession and face continued concerns about the systemic impact of adverse economic conditions  such as unstable global financial markets  adverse effects on the cost and availability of capital  high corporate  consumer and governmental debt levels and high unemployment 
concern about the stability of the markets generally  and the strength of counterparties specifically  has led and may again lead many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease  to provide credit to businesses 
renewed or increased turbulence in the global markets and economies may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 
in addition  our access to funds under any credit facility into which we may enter depends on the ability of the counterparties to such facilities to meet their funding commitments to us 
we cannot assure you that long term disruptions in the global economy and the return of tighter credit conditions among  and potential failures of  third party financial institutions as a result of such disruptions will not have an adverse effect on such counterparties 
if we do not have sufficient cash flow to continue operating our business and are unable to borrow funds or raise equity or debt capital  we may need to find alternative ways to increase our liquidity 
such alternatives may include  without limitation  curtailing clinical or drug development activity  or limiting our commercial efforts  product manufacturing or sales and marketing support  which would have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 

table of contents if we acquire other gr ii antagonists or other technologies or potential products  we will incur a variety of costs and may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
if appropriate opportunities become available  we may attempt to acquire other gr ii antagonists  particularly gr ii antagonists that do not terminate pregnancy 
we may also be able to acquire other technologies or potential products that are complementary to our operating plan 
we currently have no commitments  agreements or plans for any acquisitions 
the process of acquiring rights to another gr ii antagonist or any other potential product or technology may result in unforeseen difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business 
in addition  we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquired potential product or technology 
future acquisitions could dilute our stockholders ownership interest in us and could cause us to incur debt  expose us to future liabilities and result in amortization or other expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
failure to meet our obligations under our financing agreement with biopharma secured debt fund ii sub  s 
r 
l  could adversely affect our financial results and liquidity 
pursuant to our financing agreement with biopharma entered into in august  we are obligated to make payments to biopharma equal to percent of our net product sales of korlym  any future mifepristone based products and our next generation selective gr ii antagonists covered products  subject to certain quarterly caps  as well as an un capped percent of any upfront  milestone or other contingent payments we receive with respect to covered products  until such payments to biopharma total million 
pursuant to this agreement  we may not i incur indebtedness greater than the sum of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  including such items as non cash stock based compensation  ebitda for the four calendar quarters preceding such incurrence  which we refer to as the indebtedness covenant  ii pay a dividend or other cash distribution  unless we have cash and cash equivalents in excess of million after such payment  iii amend or restate our certificate of incorporation or bylaws unless such amendments or restatements do not affect biopharma s interests under the transaction  and iv encumber any of the collateral securing our performance under the agreement 
the percentage used to calculate our payments to biopharma would increase to percent and any applicable payment caps would lapse if we i fail to provide biopharma with certain information regarding our promotion and sales of covered products  ii do not devote a commercially reasonable amount of resources to the promotion and marketing of the covered products or iii violate the indebtedness covenant and  in each case  fail to cure within the applicable cure period 
upon a corcept change of control transaction  as defined in the agreement  biopharma will be automatically entitled to receive any amounts not previously paid  up to our maximum repayment obligation of million 
as defined in the agreement  change of control includes  among other things  i a greater than percent change in the ownership of corcept  ii certain changes in board composition of corcept and iii the licensing of korlym to a third party for sale in the united states 
to secure our obligations under the agreement  we granted biopharma a security interest in our rights in patents  trademarks  trade names  domain names  copyrights  know how and regulatory approvals related to the covered products  all books and records relating to the foregoing and all proceeds of the foregoing  which we refer to as the collateral 
if we i fail to deliver a royalty payment when due and do not remedy that failure within days  ii fail to maintain a first priority perfected security interest in the collateral in the united states and do not remedy that failure within five business days of receiving notice of such failure or iii become subject to an event of bankruptcy  then biopharma may attempt to recover up to million after deducting any payments we have already made 

table of contents there can be no assurance that we will not breach the covenants or other terms of  or that an event of default will not occur under this agreement and  if a breach or event of default occurs  there can be no assurance that we will be able to cure the event within the time permitted 
any failure to pay our obligations when due  any breach or default of our covenants or other obligations  or any other event that causes an acceleration of payment at a time when we do not have sufficient resources to meet these obligations  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and future viability 
the acceleration of the payment obligation in the event of a change of control transaction may make us less attractive to potential acquirers  and the payment of such funds out of our available cash or acquisition proceeds would reduce acquisition proceeds for our stockholders 
risks relating to our intellectual property if korlym or future product candidates conflict with the patents of others or if we become involved in other intellectual property disputes  we may have to engage in costly litigation or obtain a license and we may be unable to commercialize our product candidates 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain adequate patent protection for the use of mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression and other potential uses of gr ii antagonists 
if we do not adequately protect our intellectual property  competitors may be able to use our intellectual property and erode our competitive advantage 
to date  we own eleven issued us method of use patents and have exclusively licensed three issued us method of use patents 
we have nine us method of use patent applications pending for gr ii antagonists 
we own three composition of matter patents and have two composition of matter patent applications pending 
we have applied  and will continue to apply  for patents covering our product candidates as we deem appropriate 
we have also filed  where we deemed appropriate  foreign patent applications corresponding to our us patents and applications 
we have exclusively licensed three issued us patents from stanford university for the use of gr ii antagonists in the treatment of psychotic major depression  which is commonly referred to as psychotic depression  cocaine induced psychosis and early dementia  including early alzheimer s disease 
we bear the costs of protecting and defending the rights to these patents 
in order to maintain the exclusive license to these patents until their expiration  we are obligated to make milestone and royalty payments to stanford university 
if we become noncompliant with our obligations under this agreement  we may lose the right to commercialize mifepristone for the treatment of psychotic depression  cocaine induced psychosis and early dementia and our business would be materially harmed 
in addition  if stanford university were to terminate our mifepristone license due to breach of the license on our part  we would not be able to commercialize mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression  cocaine induced psychosis or early dementia 
our patent applications and patents licensed or issued to us may be challenged by third parties and our patent applications may not result in issued patents 
for example  in  akzo nobel  which was subsequently acquired by schering plough which was then subsequently acquired by merck co  filed an observation challenging the claims of our exclusively licensed european patent application with claims directed to psychotic depression 
in this instance  the patent later issued and  in  we received notice from the european patent office that there will be no opposition proceedings in europe in regard to this patent 
our presently pending and future patent applications may not issue as patents  and any patent issued to us may be challenged  invalidated  held unenforceable or circumvented 
for example  the arguments presented by akzo nobel could be raised in the united states either before the us patent and trademark office or in a court of law 
furthermore  the claims in patents which have been issued to us  or which may be issued to us in the future  may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products 
in addition  the laws of various foreign countries in which we compete may not protect our intellectual property to the same 
table of contents extent as do the laws of the united states 
if we fail to obtain adequate patent protection for our proprietary technology  our competitors may produce competing products based on our technology  which would impair our ability to compete 
if a third party were successful in asserting an infringement claim against us  we could be forced to pay damages and prevented from developing  manufacturing or marketing our potential products 
we do not have liability insurance for patent infringements 
a third party could require us to obtain a license to continue to use their intellectual property  and we may not be able to do so on commercially acceptable terms  or at all 
we believe that significant litigation will continue in our industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
if we become involved in litigation  it could consume a substantial portion of our resources 
regardless of the merit of any particular claim  defending a lawsuit takes significant time  is expensive and diverts management s attention from other business 
if we are unable to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information  our ability to compete in the market could be diminished 
in addition to patents  we rely on a combination of confidentiality  nondisclosure and other contractual provisions  laws protecting trade secrets and security measures to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information 
nevertheless  these measures may not adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information 
if they do not adequately protect our rights  third parties could use our proprietary information  which could diminish our ability to compete in the market 
in addition  employees  consultants and others who participate in the development of our product candidates may breach their agreements with us regarding our trade secrets and other proprietary information  and we may not have adequate remedies for the breach 
we also realize that our trade secrets may become known through means not currently foreseen 
notwithstanding our efforts to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information  our competitors may independently develop similar or alternative products that are equal or superior to our product candidates without infringing on any of our proprietary information or trade secrets 
our licensed patent covering the use of mifepristone to treat psychotic depression is a method of use patent rather than a composition of matter patent  which may make it more difficult for us to prove patent infringement if physicians prescribe another manufacturer s mifepristone for the treatment of cushing s syndrome or psychotic depression or if patients acquire mifepristone from other sources  such as the internet or black market 
we have an exclusive license from stanford university to a patent covering the use of gr ii antagonists  including mifepristone  for the treatment of psychotic depression 
a method of use patent covers only a specified use of a particular compound  not a particular composition of matter 
because none of our issued patents covers the composition of mifepristone  we cannot prevent others from commercializing mifepristone in indications not covered by our method of use patents 
if others receive approval to manufacture and market mifepristone or any other gr ii antagonist  physicians could prescribe mifepristone or any other gr ii antagonist for patients with psychotic depression instead of mifepristone 
although any such off label use would violate our licensed patent  effectively monitoring compliance with our licensed patent may be difficult and costly 
in addition  if others develop a treatment for the psychotic features of psychotic depression that works through a mechanism which does not involve the gr ii receptor  physicians could prescribe that treatment instead of mifepristone 
in addition  we cannot be assured that patients will not obtain mifepristone from other sources 
as with other pharmaceutical products  patients may be able to purchase mifepristone through the internet or black market 
mifepristone is also sold in the united states by danco laboratories for the termination of early pregnancy 
while distribution is limited to a single dose provided in the physician s office and covered by other restrictions  we cannot be certain that cushing s syndrome patients will not be able to obtain mifepristone from this source or others  should another company receive approval to market mifepristone for another indication 

table of contents risks related to our stock the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile due to the limited number of shares of our common stock held by non affiliates or factors influencing the stock market and opportunities for sale at any given time may be limited 
we cannot assure you that an active trading market for our common stock will exist at any time 
holders of our common stock may not be able to sell shares quickly or at the market price if trading in our common stock is not active 
during the week period ended march   our average daily trading volume was approximately  shares and the intra day sales prices per share of our common stock on the nasdaq stock market ranged from to 
as of march   our officers  directors and principal stockholders controlled approximately percent of our common stock 
he trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control  including the pace of market acceptance of korlym or the timing and level of coverage and reimbursement attained  our cash and short term investment position  actual or anticipated timing and results of our clinical trials  new products or services introduced or announced by us or our competitors  actual or anticipated regulatory approvals of our product candidates or of competing products  changes in laws or regulations applicable to our product candidates or our competitors products  changes in the expected or actual timing of our development programs or our competitors potential development programs  actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  including potential product returns and timing of revenue recognition  announcements of technological innovations by us  our collaborators or our competitors  general market and economic conditions  including those seen as a result of the recent worldwide financial credit crisis  changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  conditions or trends in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  changes in the market valuations of similar companies  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  additions or departures of key personnel  disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights  including patents  litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies  developments concerning collaborations  trading volume of our common stock  limited number of shares of our common stock held by our non affiliates  maintaining compliance with the listing requirements of the stock exchange on which we are listed  success of additional financing efforts  and purchases or sales of our common stock by us  our officers  directors or our stockholders 

table of contents in addition  the stock market in general  the nasdaq stock market and the market for biotechnology and life sciences companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies 
such litigation  if instituted against us  could result in substantial costs and diversion of management s attention and resources 
the failure of our financial results to meet estimates published by research analysts or other investor expectations could cause our stock price to decline 
there are inherent difficulties in predicting the amount of korlym that will be sold 
for example  the rate of physician adoption of korlym is uncertain 
furthermore  the timing of a single large order for korlym could substantially affect our revenue  making our levels of revenue potentially volatile and the identification of revenue trends difficult 
due to such uncertainty  we have not provided any revenue forecasts to investors or research analysts 
research analysts who cover our business have  however  put forth a wide range of revenue estimates  based entirely on their own investigation and analysis 
we have not guided or commented on these estimates and you should rely on them at your own discretion 
announcement of financial results that fail to meet analyst estimates or the expectations of investors could cause our stock price to decline 
research analysts may not continue to provide or initiate coverage of our common stock or may issue negative reports  which may have a negative impact on our common stock s market price 
securities analysts currently covering our common stock may discontinue research coverage 
additional securities analysts may elect not to provide research coverage of our common stock 
a lack of research coverage may adversely affect our common stock s market price 
the trading market for our common stock may be affected in part by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business 
if one or more of the analysts who elects to cover us downgrades our stock  our stock price would likely decline rapidly and significantly 
if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company  we could lose visibility in the market  which in turn could cause our stock price to decline 
in addition  rules mandated by the sarbanes oxley act of  and a global settlement reached in between the sec  other regulatory analysts and a number of investment banks have led to a number of fundamental changes in how analysts are reviewed and compensated 
in particular  many investment banking firms are required to contract with independent financial analysts for their stock research 
it may be difficult for companies such as ours with smaller market capitalizations to attract independent financial analysts that will cover our common stock 
this could have a negative effect on our market price 
a sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could harm the market price of our common stock 
as additional shares of our common stock become available for resale in the public market  whether as a result of equity financings by us or due to the release of trading restrictions  the supply of our common stock will increase  which could decrease the price 
substantially all of the shares of our common stock are eligible for sale  subject to applicable volume and other resale restrictions 
we may be required to pay significant amounts if we are not able to meet our obligations under our outstanding registration rights agreements 
the registration rights agreement covering the approximately million shares of our common stock issued in a private offering in march and an additional approximately million shares of common stock underlying warrants issued in connection with the offering provides that if we fail to file or cause to be declared effective the registration statement covering the resale of these shares prior to specified deadlines  or fail to 
table of contents maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement subject to limited permissible suspension periods  we will be required to pay the holders of such shares and warrants liquidated damages at the rate of percent of the purchase price of these shares and warrants per month  up to a total of percent 
the registration statement covering the resale of the shares and shares underlying the warrants sold in this transaction was declared effective by the sec in november since this registration statement was not declared effective within the time frame specified in the registration rights agreement  we became obligated to pay liquidated damages of approximately million in to the investors in this financing  which obligation was settled in the form of stock in lieu of cash in november as noted above  if we fail to maintain the effectiveness of this registration statement  we may be obligated to pay additional liquidated damage amounts in the future 
in addition  in march  we entered into a ceff with kingsbridge  under which we granted to kingsbridge a warrant for the purchase of  shares of common stock 
we terminated our ceff with kingsbridge effective august  and no further securities will be sold thereunder 
however  under the registration rights agreement issued in connection with the ceff  we are required to continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement covering the shares sold under this agreement and to be issued upon the exercise of the warrant for a period of up to two years following the termination of the ceff  subject to earlier termination on certain events 
during this period  if the effectiveness of the registration statement lapses through actions that were within our control  we may be obligated to pay kingsbridge for all shares issued upon exercise of the warrant and still owned by kingsbridge at any time during the period of ineffectiveness the difference between a the volume weighted average price as of the day prior to the period of ineffectiveness and b the volume weighted average price as of the day following the period of ineffectiveness 
if we are required to pay significant amounts under this or future registration rights agreements  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and ability to finance our operations 
our officers  directors and principal stockholders  acting as a group  will be able to significantly influence corporate actions 
as of march   our officers  directors and principal stockholders control approximately percent of our common stock 
as a result  these stockholders  acting together  will be able to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
the interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders and may prevent or delay a change in control 
this significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages to owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders 
changes in laws and regulations may result in increased costs to us  which may harm our financial results 
new laws and regulations  as well as changes to existing laws and regulations  affecting our company  including the provisions of the ppaca requiring the reporting of aggregate spending related to health care professionals  the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of and rules adopted by the sec and by the nasdaq stock market have and will likely continue to result in increased costs to us as we respond to their requirements 
we are investing resources to comply with evolving laws and regulations  and this investment may result in increased selling  general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management s time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
in addition  new rules and regulations could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance  including director and officer liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors  or our board committees  or as executive officers 
at present  we cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs related to new rules and regulations or the timing of such costs 

table of contents compliance with public company obligations  including the securities laws and regulations  is costly and requires significant management resources  and we may fail to comply 
we are a small company with limited resources 
the federal securities laws and regulations  including the corporate governance and other requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of  impose complex and continually changing regulatory requirements on our operations and reporting 
these requirements impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements  set stricter independence and financial expertise standards for audit committee members  and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies  their chief executive officers  principal financial officers and directors for securities law violations 
these requirements have increased and will continue to increase our legal compliance costs  increase the difficulty and expense in obtaining director and officer liability insurance  and make it harder for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors and or qualified executive officers 
such developments could harm our results of operations and divert management s attention from business operations 
in addition  as directed by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  the sec adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the company s internal control over financial reporting in their annual reports on form k 
this requirement first applied to our annual report on form k for the year ended december  this same legislation also requires that the independent registered public accounting firm auditing our financial statements must attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
this requirement first applied to our annual report on form k for the year ended december  uncertainty exists regarding our ability to comply with these requirements by applicable deadlines and to maintain compliance in future years 
if we are unable to complete the required assessment as to the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting in future years or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of future year ends  investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial reporting 
changes in or interpretations of accounting rules and regulations could result in unfavorable accounting charges or require us to change our accounting policies or operating practices 
accounting methods and policies for business and marketing practices of pharmaceutical companies are subject to continual review  interpretation and guidance from relevant accounting authorities  including the sec 
for example  in december  the financial accounting standards board adopted a revised standard related to stock based compensation 
this standard  which we adopted in  requires the recording of expense for stock options granted using fair value based measurements 
as a result  our operating expenses have increased and are likely to continue to increase 
we rely heavily on stock options to compensate existing employees and attract new employees 
because we are now required to expense stock options using fair value based measurements  we may choose to reduce our reliance on stock options as a compensation tool 
if we reduce our use of stock options  it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified employees 
although we believe that our accounting practices are consistent with current accounting pronouncements  changes to or interpretations of accounting methods or policies in the future may require us to reclassify  restate or otherwise change or revise our financial statements 
any such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and income 
any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline 
if we fail to continue to meet all applicable nasdaq stock market requirements  our stock could be delisted by the nasdaq stock market 
if delisting occurs  it would adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and harm our business 
if we are unable to meet any of the nasdaq listing requirements in the future  including  for example  if the closing bid price for our common stock is below per share for consecutive trading days  the nasdaq stock market could determine to delist our common stock  the delisting could adversely affect the market 
table of contents liquidity of our common stock and the market price of our common stock could decrease 
such delisting could also adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations and could result in the loss of confidence by investors  suppliers and employees 
anti takeover provisions in our charter and bylaws and under delaware law and payment acceleration provisions under the biopharma financing agreement may make an acquisition of us or a change in our management more expensive or difficult  even if an acquisition or a management change would be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions in our charter and bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management 
some of these provisions allow us to issue preferred stock without any vote or further action by the stockholders  require advance notification of stockholder proposals and nominations of candidates for election as directors and prohibit stockholders from acting by written consent 
in addition  a supermajority vote of stockholders is required to amend our bylaws 
our bylaws provide that special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by our chairman  president or the board of directors and that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors 
these provisions may prevent or delay a change in our board of directors or our management  which is appointed by our board of directors 
in addition  because we are incorporated in delaware  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
section may prohibit large stockholders  in particular those owning percent or more of our outstanding voting stock  from merging or combining with us 
in addition  our payment obligations to biopharma accelerate in the event of a change of control transaction 
see risk factors failure to meet our obligations under our financing agreement with biopharma secured debt fund ii sub  s

overview we are a pharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery  development and commercialization of drugs for the treatment of severe metabolic and psychiatric disorders 
our focus is on disorders associated with the steroid hormone cortisol 
elevated levels and abnormal release patterns of cortisol have been implicated in a broad range of human disorders 
since our inception in may  we have been developing mifepristone  a potent glucocorticoid receptor ii gr ii antagonist 
on february   the fda approved korlym mifepristone mg tablets in the united states as a once daily oral medication for treatment of hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in adult patients with endogenous cushing s syndrome who have type diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and have failed surgery or are not candidates for surgery 
we made korlym available to patients in april and have begun marketing the drug in the united states 
we continue to develop the sales  marketing  medical affairs and logistical infrastructure needed to commercialize the drug 
we also have an on going phase study of mifepristone  the active ingredient in korlym  for treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
we have discovered three series of novel selective gr ii antagonists 
unless otherwise stated  all references in this document to we  us  our  corcept  the company  our company and similar designations refer to corcept therapeutics incorporated 
cushing s syndrome 
cushing s syndrome is a disorder caused by prolonged exposure of the body s tissues to high levels of the hormone cortisol 
sometimes called hypercortisolism  it is uncommon and most often affects adults aged to an estimated to of every one million people are newly diagnosed with this syndrome each year  resulting in approximately  new patients and an estimated prevalence of  patients with cushing s syndrome in the united states 
the fda approved our nda for korlym on february  this approval allows us to market korlym in the united states for its approved indication 
we are carrying out our commercialization plans  including hiring a small number of medical science liaisons msls and sales representatives 
we have also developed internet marketing capabilities and patient assistance programs to support physicians and patients 
we began shipping korlym to our specialty pharmacy in early april  and the medicine first became available to patients on april  we finished hiring our team of msls in the third quarter of our sales representatives received their initial training and were deployed to the field in the fourth quarter of we have orphan drug designations for korlym from the fda for the approved indication and from the european commission for the treatment of endogenous cushing s syndrome 
orphan drug designation in the united states is a special status granted by the fda to encourage the development of treatments for diseases or conditions that affect fewer than  patients in the united states 
drugs that receive orphan drug designation obtain seven years of marketing exclusivity for the approved indication from the date of drug 
table of contents approval  as well as tax credits for clinical trial costs  marketing application filing fee waivers and assistance from the fda in the drug development process 
benefits of orphan drug designation in the eu are similar to those in the united states  but include ten years of marketing exclusivity for the approved indication in all member states  free scientific advice during drug development  access to a centralized review process and a reduction or complete waiver of fees levied by the european medicines agency 
psychotic depression 
we are also developing mifepristone  the active ingredient in korlym  for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression under an exclusive patent license from stanford university 
the fda has granted fast track status to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
in march  we began enrollment in study  our ongoing phase trial in psychotic depression 
the protocol for this trial incorporates what we have learned from our three previously completed phase trials 
it attempts to address the established relationship between increased drug plasma levels and clinical response and attempts to decrease the random variability observed in the results of the psychometric instruments used to measure efficacy 
in one of the previously completed phase trials  study  we prospectively tested and confirmed that patients whose plasma levels rose above a predetermined threshold statistically separated from both those patients whose plasma levels were below the threshold and those patients who received placebo  this threshold was established from data produced in earlier studies 
as expected  the group of patients who took milligrams mg of mifepristone in study developed higher drug plasma levels than did the groups of patients who received lower doses 
further  there was no discernable difference in the incidence of adverse events between patients who received placebo in study and those who received mg  mg or mg of mifepristone in that study 
in august  we published our analysis of these data in the journal of clinical psychopharmacology 
based on this information  we are testing a mifepristone dose of mg once per day for seven days in study in addition  we are using a third party centralized rating service to independently evaluate the patients for entry into the study as well as to evaluate their level of response throughout their participation in the study 
we believe the centralization of this process will improve the consistency of rating across clinical trial sites and reduce the background statistical noise that was observed in earlier studies and is endemic to psychopharmacologic studies 
we believe that the change in dose  as well as the other modifications to the protocol described above  should allow us to demonstrate the efficacy of mifepristone in the treatment of the psychotic symptoms of psychotic depression 
in mid  to conserve financial resources  we reduced the number of clinical sites in this study to eight and extended the timeline for its completion 
enrollment in study is ongoing 
our goal is to enroll a sufficient number of patients by the end of to be able to perform a successful interim analysis 
to help reach this goal  we began adding clinical sites in the fourth quarter of and plan to have sites by the end of the first quarter of antipsychotic induced weight gain mitigation 
in  we announced the results of studies in rats that demonstrated that mifepristone both reversed the weight gain associated with the ongoing use of olanzapine and mitigated the weight gain associated with the initiation of treatment with olanzapine the active ingredient in zyprexa 
the results from this study were published in the journal brain behavioral research in early this study was paid for by eli lilly and company eli lilly 
during  we announced positive results from our clinical proof of concept study in lean healthy male volunteers evaluating the ability of mifepristone to mitigate weight gain associated with the use of zyprexa 
the results showed a statistically significant reduction in weight gain in those subjects who took zyprexa plus mifepristone compared to those who took zyprexa plus placebo 
also  the addition of mifepristone to treatment with zyprexa had a beneficial impact on secondary metabolic measures such as fasting insulin  triglycerides and abdominal fat  as indicated by waist circumference 
eli lilly provided zyprexa and financial support for this 
table of contents study  the results of which were published in the journal advances in therapy in in january  we announced positive results from a similar proof of concept study evaluating the ability of mifepristone to mitigate weight gain associated with the use of johnson johnson s risperdal 
this study confirmed and extended the earlier results seen with mifepristone and zyprexa  demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in weight gain and in the secondary metabolic endpoints of fasting insulin  triglycerides and abdominal fat  as indicated by waist circumference 
the results from the study of mifepristone and risperdal were presented at several scientific conferences  including the american diabetes association meeting in june  and were published in the journal obesity in the combination of zyprexa or risperdal and mifepristone is not approved for any indication 
the purpose of these studies was to explore the hypothesis that gr ii antagonists  such as mifepristone and our next generation of selective gr ii antagonists  would mitigate weight gain associated with antipsychotic medications 
the group of medications known as second generation antipsychotic medication  including zyprexa  risperdal  clozaril and seroquel  are widely used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder 
all medications in this group are associated with treatment emergent weight gain of varying degrees and carry a warning in their labels relating to treatment emergent hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus 
selective gr ii receptor antagonists 
in  we initiated a discovery research program to identify and patent selective gr ii antagonists with the intent of developing a pipeline of products for proprietary use 
three distinct series of gr ii antagonists were identified 
these compounds  like mifepristone  potently block the cortisol receptor gr ii but  unlike mifepristone  they do not appear to block the pr progesterone  er estrogen  ar androgen or gr i mineralocorticoid receptors 
both the united states patent trademark office uspto and the european patent office epo have issued composition of matter patents to us on each of the three series 
two additional composition of matter patent applications are pending 
several of our new compounds have demonstrated positive results in animal models for the prevention and reversal of anti psychotic induced weight gain 
one of them  cort  is in exploratory phase a clinical trials and we plan to explore its potential use in other indications 
we have identified other selective gr ii antagonists from our proprietary series that we believe may have utility as therapeutic agents in a variety of diseases 
our intent is to continue our discovery research program with the goal of identifying new selective gr ii antagonists and to manufacture and conduct pre clinical development on one or more of these compounds and to submit investigational new drug ind applications with respect to the most promising of them  as we deem appropriate 
at the american diabetes association conference in june  there was also a presentation of preclinical data from another study of cort conducted at stanford university 
this study demonstrated that cort suppresses body weight gain and improves insulin sensitivity in healthy mice fed a percent fat diet and high sucrose liquid 
the results of these preclinical data were published in april in the journal nutrition and metabolism 
in addition  we are continuing research and pre clinical efforts to identify additional selective gr ii antagonists for clinical study 
general our activities to date have included product development  including drug formulation and manufacturing  as well as designing  funding and overseeing clinical trials and conducting non human clinical investigatory activities  such as toxicological testing  commercialization of korlym  including hiring and training medical science liaisons and sales representatives  retention and management of third party distribution partners  establishment of third party coverage and reimbursement and patient assistance programs and marketing activities 

table of contents discovery research  intellectual property prosecution and expansion  and regulatory affairs 
historically  we have financed our operations and internal growth primarily through private placements of our preferred and common stock  the public sale of common stock and our capped royalty financing transaction  rather than through collaborative or partnership agreements 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our historical operating losses have resulted principally from our research and development activities  including clinical trial activities for mifepristone  discovery research  non clinical activities such as toxicology and carcinogenicity studies  manufacturing process development and regulatory activities  as well as selling  general and administrative expenses  including preparations for the commercial launch of korlym 
we may continue to incur net losses over at least the next few years as we continue our mifepristone and selective gr ii antagonist discovery and clinical development programs  apply for regulatory approvals  acquire and or develop treatments in other therapeutic areas  establish sales and marketing capabilities and expand our operations 
our business is subject to significant risks  including the risks inherent in our research and development efforts  the results of our mifepristone and other clinical trials  uncertainties associated with securing financing  uncertainties associated with obtaining and enforcing patents  our investment in manufacturing set up  the management of our supply chain  the lengthy and expensive regulatory approval process and competition from other products 
our ability to successfully generate revenues in the foreseeable future is dependent upon our ability  alone or with others  to finance our operations and develop  obtain regulatory approval for  manufacture and market our products 
results of operations net product sales net product sales includes product revenue resulting from sales to our customers  reduced by trade allowances  such as discounts for prompt payment and distributor fees  estimated government rebates and chargebacks  reserves for expected product returns and estimated costs of our patient assistance program 
in april  we made korlym commercially available in the united states through a specialty pharmacy that sells to individual patients and a specialty distributor that sells to hospital pharmacies 
for the year ended december   we recognized million in net product sales 
to calculate net product sales  we deducted from gross sales estimates of prompt pay discounts  distribution service fees  rebates and chargebacks owed to government payors and patient assistance program costs  which amounts are not material for the year ended december  based on our limited experience marketing korlym  it is difficult for us to forecast its sales for any future periods 
cost of sales cost of sales includes the cost to manufacture korlym which includes material  third party manufacturing costs and indirect personnel and other overhead costs based on units sold in the current period  as well as the cost of stability testing and distribution 
we began capitalizing korlym production costs as inventory following approval by the fda to market korlym on february  prior to korlym s approval  we expensed all costs related to the manufacturing of product including stability costs and manufacturing overhead as incurred  classifying these costs as research and development expense 
a portion of the product manufactured prior to fda approval is available for us to use commercially 
cost of sales was  for the year ended december   which equals percent of net product sales for the same period 
the majority of these costs related to stability testing 
the amount and timing of 
table of contents stability testing varies from period to period as determined by fda regulations and our production schedule and is not a fixed percentage of our sales volumes 
in addition  the cost of manufacturing korlym reflected in our cost of sales in  and for some period thereafter  will not reflect the full cost of production because we have previously expensed the majority of the raw materials  labor and overhead costs incurred to produce the product sold during this period 
we expect that our cost of sales of korlym as a percentage of net product sales will fluctuate from period to period during and for some time thereafter as product manufactured prior to fda approval  which is already fully expensed  is consumed 
research and development expenses research and development expenses include the personnel costs related to our development activities  including facilities costs and non cash stock based compensation  the costs of discovery research  costs associated with ind enabling activities and pre clinical studies  costs of clinical trials  including trial preparation  enrollment  site monitoring and data management and analysis expenses  regulatory costs  the costs of manufacturing development  including the development and activities to qualify a second tablet manufacturing site  the costs of manufacture and or acquisition of clinical trial materials and material used in registration and validation batches included in the nda submission for korlym and other costs associated with the preparation and prosecution of the korlym nda or other fda submissions related to korlym or other product candidates 
research and development expenses decreased percent to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in during the year ended december  as compared to the corresponding period in  there was an increase of  in staffing costs  which includes bonuses paid on fda approval of korlym in the amount of  and an increase of  for stock based compensation expenses related to employees working in research and development functions 
during the year ended december  as compared to the corresponding periods in  there were decreases in consultancy costs of million due primarily to the additional resources required during for the preparation  submission and prosecution of the nda  which was submitted in april and filed by the fda in june for the year ended december   non cash stock based compensation expense related to consultant options decreased  as compared to the corresponding period of due primarily to the inclusion in of costs related to a stock option award to a consultant that vested in its entirety on the acceptance of the nda by the fda in june korlym manufacturing costs categorized as research and development expense decreased million during the year ended december  as compared to the corresponding period in  due primarily to capitalizing to inventory the costs of korlym s active pharmaceutical ingredient and the manufacture of korlym tablets for commercial sale following the date of fda approval 
clinical trial costs reflected a net decrease of million during the year ended december   as compared to the corresponding period of during the year ended december  as compared to the corresponding period in  there were decreases of million related to clinical studies with cort and  related to the clinical trials with korlym in the treatment of cushing s syndrome 
these decreases were partially offset by increases during year ended december   as compared to the corresponding period of  of  related to the psychotic depression study 
in addition  costs related to financial support for medical conferences and seminars in support of our cushing s syndrome program decreased  for the year ended december   as compared to the corresponding period of  because  subsequent to product approval  the nature of our activities at medical meetings has changed  and now such costs relate to marketing activities that are classified as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
costs relating to ind enabling activities and research efforts regarding our new gr ii antagonists increased  during the year ended december   as compared to the corresponding period in research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in for the year ended december  as compared to the 
table of contents corresponding period in  there were net increases of million in consultancy costs which included the following increases a  related to the development of the risk evaluation and mitigation system rems that was included in the korlym nda submission  b  related to the preparation  submission and prosecution of the nda  c  related to the development of a medical safety program  d  related to manufacturing and quality control activities to prepare for commercialization and e  in non cash stock based compensation costs related to a performance based award to a consultant that vested in june upon the filing of our nda for korlym by the fda  which were partially offset by the decrease in consulting fees in other clinical activities of  for the year ended december   as compared to the corresponding period in  there was also an increase of  related to attendance of seminars in support of our cushing s syndrome program 
korlym manufacturing costs increased million during the year ended december   as compared to the corresponding period in  due primarily to the acquisition of active pharmaceutical ingredient for korlym and the initiation of manufacturing development work at a potential back up site for the manufacture of korlym that were only partially offset by a decrease in manufacturing activities related to our proprietary  selective new gr ii antagonists 
there were decreases in clinical trial costs of million during the year ended december   as compared to the corresponding period of clinical trial cost decreases included a million related to drug drug interaction and other nda supportive studies with korlym that were substantially completed during  b  related to the clinical trials with korlym for the treatment of cushing s syndrome due to patients having completed the initial study and moving into the long term extension study  c  related to the clinical trial with mifepristone for the treatment of psychotic depression and d  related to clinical studies activities with cort during the year ended december   as compared to the corresponding period in  there was also a decrease of  related to the ind enabling work on cort  which was partially offset by increases of  related to research efforts on our other selective gr ii antagonists 
below is a summary of our research and development expenses by major project year ended december  project in thousands development programs cushing s syndrome psychotic depression selective gr ii antagonists unallocated activities  including nda supportive studies and manufacturing  regulatory and pre clinical activities stock based compensation total research and development expense we expect that research and development expenditures in will likely be higher than they were in  due to the cost of expanding enrollment in our phase study of mifepristone in the treatment of psychotic depression and increased spending on the development of our next generation selective gr ii antagonists 
research and development expenses in and beyond will depend on our strategic priorities 
see also  liquidity and capital resources 
many factors can affect the cost and timing of our trials including inconclusive results requiring more clinical trials  slow patient enrollment  adverse side effects in study patients  insufficient supplies for our clinical trials and real or perceived lack of effectiveness or safety of the drug in our trials 
the cost and timing of 
table of contents development of our selective gr ii antagonists will depend on the success of our efforts and any difficulties that we may encounter 
in addition  the development of all of our product candidates will be subject to extensive governmental regulation 
these factors make it difficult for us to predict the timing and costs of the further development and approval of our product candidates 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include personnel and consultancy costs related to administrative and commercialization activities  including facilities costs and non cash stock based compensation  expenses of third party vendors that we engage to execute our commercial plans related to korlym  including conducting market research  providing market analytics  developing reimbursement support services and  distribution and other logistical needs related to our commercialization of korlym and legal  accounting and other professional fees 
for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million from million for the comparable period in during the year ended december  as compared to the corresponding period in  staffing and consultancy costs increased million due primarily to additional resources necessary to commercialize korlym 
the increase for the year ended december  included million in cash bonuses awarded in the first quarter of to employees working in selling  general and administrative functions in recognition of the fda s approval of korlym  million of non cash stock based compensation costs related to performance based stock option awards to officers that vested in february upon the fda approval of korlym and  of increases related to other stock options to directors  officers and employees working in selling  general and administrative functions 
in addition  other professional services costs related to commercialization activities and other corporate matters increased million during the year ended december  as compared to the corresponding period of these costs reflect increased vendor activities after fda approval  pricing strategy and market analysis  patient registry and reimbursement programs  focus groups  internet marketing and communications 
there were also cost increases during the year ended december  as compared to the corresponding period of related to the infrastructure necessary to support the commercialization of korlym including a  related to travel  b  related to the expansion of facilities and information technology support  c  related to employee education primarily due to the training of the new medical science liaisons and d  related to donations 
for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million from million for the year ended december  during  we had recorded an aggregate amount of million related to bonuses awarded to our officers and employees working in selling  general and administrative functions in recognition of significant company accomplishments during we did not award bonuses for performance to any officer or employee in these functions 
in addition  during  as compared to  staffing and consultancy costs increased million due primarily to additional resources necessary to engage in preparations for the potential commercialization of korlym  which included an increase of  in noncash stock based compensation costs related to stock options granted to employees  directors and consultants 
there was also an increase of million during  as compared to  in market research and other commercialization preparation activities and an increase in legal costs related to patents  commercialization  compliance and other corporate matters during  as compared to  of  selling  general and administrative expenses included stock based compensation expense related to option grants to individuals performing these functions of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase during as compared to in regard to activities directly associated with product commercialization and the need to continue building our 
table of contents administrative infrastructure to support these activities 
the level of selling  general and administrative activities and related expenses in and future years will be largely dependent on our assessment of the staff and other services necessary to support product commercialization and our continued clinical development activities and the availability of additional funds

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have incurred operating losses since inception  and at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
since our inception  we have relied primarily on the proceeds from public and private sales of our equity securities and our capped royalty financing transaction to fund our operations 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to million at december  net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
we used cash in each period primarily for research and development activities  including efforts toward the submission and prosecution of the nda for korlym  for the commercialization of korlym and to develop administrative infrastructure to support commercialization 
in july  we sold million shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering for net proceeds of million after deducting expenses of the offering 
in march  we issued approximately million shares of our common stock upon the exercise of warrants that had been issued in a private placement transaction in april and sold new warrants to the same investors to purchase approximately million shares of common stock 
the net proceeds generated in this transaction were million  after the deduction of issuance costs 
in addition  during the year ended december   additional warrants and stock options were exercised for the purchase of our common generating aggregate net proceeds of  in march  we entered into a ceff with kingsbridge  under which the determination of the timing and amount of any ceff financings were to be made solely by us  subject to certain conditions 
as discussed in note of our financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k  effective august   we terminated the ceff 
no further securities will be sold under this agreement 
as discussed in notes and of our financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k  in august  we entered into a purchase and sale agreement financing agreement with biopharma secured debt fund ii sub  s 
r 
l biopharma  a private limited liability company organized under the laws of luxembourg  under which we received million 
pursuant to the financing agreement  beginning with the quarter ending june   we will make quarterly payments equal to i percent of our net product sales of korlym and any other products containing mifepristone or any of our proprietary selective gr ii antagonists covered products  subject to certain quarterly payment caps through and ii percent of any upfront  milestone or other contingent payments we receive under co promotion or out licensing agreements with respect to covered products subsequent to entering into the agreement without application of caps  until we have made cumulative payments of million 
under the terms of the financing agreement  our payments are variable  with no fixed minimums 
if there are no net sales  upfront  milestone or other contingent payments in a period with respect to covered products  then no payment will be due for that period 
we expect cash used in operating activities will increase during as compared to spending levels in due to the continued commercialization of korlym  the continuation and scale up of our phase clinical trial of mifepristone for the treatment of psychotic depression and the continued development of our selective gr ii antagonists  which will be only partially offset by sales of korlym 
we expect our funding requirements for operating activities may increase in and possibly beyond as costs associated with the continuation of our development program for cushing s syndrome  continuation and expansion of our development programs for psychotic depression and our selective gr ii antagonists  research activities  commercialization activities and selling  general and administrative expenses may be only partially offset by revenues from sales of korlym 
in addition  as discussed below under the caption contractual obligations and commercial commitments  beginning in july we will be required to make payments under the biopharma financing agreement  the amount of which will be variable 
we may choose to raise additional funds to finance our strategic priorities 
we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
further  any additional equity financing may be 
table of contents dilutive to stockholders  and any debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
if we obtain funds through collaborations with others  these arrangements may be on unfavorable terms or may require us to relinquish certain rights to our technologies or product candidates  including potentially our lead product candidate that we would otherwise seek to develop on our own 
while we monitor the cash balance in our checking account and transfer the funds in only as needed  these cash balances and our money market fund could be impacted if the underlying financial institution were to fail or were subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
to date  we have experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in our checking accounts or money market fund

in consideration of the million payment  we are obligated to make payments to biopharma totaling million  calculated as follows percent of our net product sales of covered products  beginning with the calendar quarter ending june   subject to quarterly payment caps of  during   during  and  during there is no quarterly cap on payments with respect to net product sales in and later 
percent of payments received for upfront  milestone or other contingent fees under co promotion and out license agreements for covered products without application of quarterly caps  provided however  that any amounts received under such agreements after the transaction s effective date of august  but before june  would be deferred and made simultaneously with the payment for the calendar quarter ending june  the percentage used to calculate our payments to biopharma would increase to percent and any applicable payment caps would lapse if we i fail to provide biopharma with certain information regarding our promotion and sales of covered products  ii do not devote a commercially reasonable amount of resources to the promotion and marketing of the covered products or iii violate the indebtedness covenant by incurring indebtedness greater than the sum of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  including such items as non cash stock based compensation  ebitda for the four calendar quarters preceding such incurrence and  in each case  fail to cure within the applicable cure period 
upon the occurrence of a corcept change of control transaction or the licensing of korlym to a third party for promotion and sale in the united states  the entire million  less any amounts already paid by us  would become due 
under the terms of the financing agreement  our payments are entirely variable  with no fixed minimums 
the timing of our payments is determined by future sales and other receipts 
if there are no net sales  upfront  milestone or other contingent payments in a period with respect to covered products  then no payment will be due for that period 
biopharma s right to receive payments will expire once it has received cumulative payments of million 
amounts reflected for research and development studies exclude amounts included in accounts payable and accrued clinical costs reflected on the balance sheet as of december  during  we entered into agreements for services in connection with our ongoing phase trial to confirm the utility of mifepristone for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression

in june  we amended these agreements to reduce the amounts of commitments with these 
table of contents organizations by million in accordance with the short term reduction in the scope of activities under this trial 
in december  we further amended these agreements to reflect the increase in trial activities toward our goal of concluding trial enrolment by the end of  increasing the cost by million

under our cancellable license agreement with stanford university  we are obligated to make nonrefundable minimum royalty payments of  annually for as long as we maintain our licenses with stanford  however  these payments are creditable against future royalties 
we also have other contractual payment obligations and purchase commitments  the timing of which are contingent on future events 
a under our license agreement with stanford university related to the patent covering the use of gr ii antagonists to treat the psychosis associated with psychotic depression and early dementia  we are obligated to make milestone payments to stanford of  upon filing of an nda covering a licensed product and  upon fda approval of a licensed product 
the milestone payments payable to stanford under these licenses are creditable against future royalties 
b under the agreement with a contract research company we may be obligated to make milestone payments upon the occurrence of certain events  including i  upon patent filings in connection with the project  ii  for each entry into a phase clinical trial  and iii  in respect of each first national regulatory approval of each product arising from work performed under the agreement  provided that sales of the product by the company or any future licensees reach  these obligations remain in force after the conclusion of work under the agreement

net operating loss carryforwards at december  we had net operating loss carryforwards available to offset any future taxable income that we may generate for federal income tax purposes of million  which expire in the years through  and california net operating loss carryforwards of million  which expire in the years through we also had federal and california research and development tax credits of million and million  respectively 
the federal research credits will expire in the years through and the california research credits have no expiration date 
our deferred tax assets have been offset by a full valuation allowance as the realization of such assets is uncertain 
utilization of our net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
such limitations could result in the expiration of the net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards before utilization

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
net product sales we sell korlym to a specialty pharmacy and a specialty distributor  which subsequently resell korlym to patients and healthcare providers 
we recognize product revenues from sales of korlym upon delivery to our customers as long as i there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists between ourselves and the customer  ii collectability is reasonably assured and iii the price is fixed or determinable 
in order to conclude that the price is fixed or determinable  we must be able to i calculate gross product revenues from the sales to our customers and ii reasonably estimate net product revenues 
we calculate gross product revenues based on the price that we charge our customers 
we estimate our net product revenues by deducting from our gross product revenues a trade allowances  such as discounts for prompt payment and distributor fees  b estimated government rebates and chargebacks  c reserves for expected product returns and d estimated costs of patient assistance programs 
we initially record estimates for these deductions at the time we recognize the gross revenue 
we update our estimates on a recurring basis as new information becomes available 
trade allowances we offer our customers a discount on korlym sales for payment within days 
we also offer them a small discount for the provision of data services 
we expect our customers to earn these discounts and accordingly deduct them in full from gross product revenues and trade receivables at the time we recognize such revenues 
rebates and chargebacks we contract with medicaid and other government agencies so that korlym will be eligible for purchase by  or qualify for partial or full reimbursement from  such government programs 
we estimate the rebates and chargebacks that we will be obligated to provide to government programs and deduct these estimated amounts from our gross product sales at the time the revenues are recognized 
we base our estimates of these rebates and chargebacks upon i the discount amounts applicable to government funded programs and ii information obtained from our vendors regarding the percentage of sales by our customers to patients who are covered by entities or programs that are eligible for such rebates and chargebacks 
allowances for patient assistance program we provide financial assistance to eligible patients whose insurance policies require them to pay high deductibles and co pays 
we estimate the cost of assistance to be provided under this program by applying our actual experience regarding such assistance to our estimate of the percentage of our sales in the period that will be provided to patients covered by the program 
sales returns our customers have the right to return korlym beginning six months before the labeled expiration date and ending months after the labeled expiration date 
this right of return is extended to our specialty distributor channel s hospital customers who generally have the right to return only unopened bottles 
the expiration date for our korlym product sold in will not occur until late in we estimate the amount of korlym that we believe will be returned and deduct that estimated amount from gross revenue at the time we recognize such revenue 
when estimating future returns  we analyze quantitative and qualitative information including  but not limited to  actual return rates  the amount of product in the distribution channel  the expected shelf life of such product  current and projected product demand  the introduction of competing products that may erode demand  and broad economic and industry wide indicators 
if we cannot reasonably estimate product returns with respect to a particular sale  we defer recognition of revenue from that sale until such time as a reasonable estimate can be made 

table of contents inventory and cost of sales we consider regulatory approval of product candidates to be uncertain  and product manufactured prior to regulatory approval may not be sold unless regulatory approval is obtained 
we expense manufacturing costs for product candidates incurred prior to regulatory approval as research and development expenses as we incur them 
when regulatory approval of a product is obtained  we begin capitalizing manufacturing costs related to the approved product into inventory 
we value our inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
we determine the cost of inventory using the specific identification method  which approximates a first in  first out basis 
we analyze our inventory levels quarterly and write down inventory that has become obsolete or has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value  as well as any inventory quantities in excess of expected requirements 
any expired inventory is disposed of and the related costs are recognized as cost of sales 
cost of sales includes the cost of product the cost to manufacture korlym  which includes material  third party manufacturing costs and indirect personnel and other overhead costs based on units for which revenue is recognized in the current period  as well as costs of stability testing  logistics and distribution of the product 
we began capitalizing korlym production costs as inventory following approval by the fda on february  prior to receiving fda approval for korlym  we expensed all costs related to the manufacturing of the product including stability costs and manufacturing overhead as incurred  we classified these costs as research and development expense 
a portion of the product manufactured prior to fda approval is available for us to use commercially 
inventory amounts that are not expected to be consumed within twelve months following the balance sheet date are classified as a noncurrent asset 
accruals of research and development costs we recorded accruals for estimated costs of research  pre clinical and clinical studies  and manufacturing development with outstanding balances of  and  as of december  and  respectively 
these costs are a significant component of our research and development expenses 
we make significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrual balance in each reporting period 
accrued clinical trial costs are based on estimates of the work completed under the service agreements  milestones achieved  patient enrollment and past experience with similar contracts and service providers 
our estimate of the work completed  and associated costs to be accrued  includes our assessment of the information received from our third party contract research organizations and the overall status of our clinical trial activities 
in the past  we have not experienced any material deviations between accrued and actual clinical trial expenses 
however  actual services performed  number of patients enrolled and the rate of patient enrollment may vary from our estimates  resulting in adjustments to clinical trial expense in future periods 
stock based compensation stock based compensation arises from the granting of stock options to employees and directors  as well as to non employees 
employees and directors our accounting practices and the estimates and judgments that are considered in determining fair value in regard to stock option grants to employees and directors are as follows for options granted from january  through september  the expected term used in determining the fair value based measurement of options was based on the simplified method prescribed by the sec that considers the weighted average of the vesting period and contractual life of the options 
for options granted since september  the expected term has been based on a formula that considers the expected service period and expected post vesting termination behavior differentiated by whether the grantee is an employee  an officer or a director 

table of contents we base the expected volatility of our common stock used in determining the fair value based measurement of option grants to employees  officers and directors on a weighted average combination of the volatility of our own stock price and that of a group of peer companies for those grants with expected terms longer than the period of time that we have been a public company 
for stock options granted to employees with expected terms of less than the period of time that we have been a public company  the volatility is based on historical data of the price for our common stock for periods of time equivalent to the expected term of these grants 
for service based awards  we recognize the expense over the requisite service period utilizing the straight line amortization method 
for options with performance based vesting criteria  we recognize the expense at such time as there is a high degree of probability ie  greater than of achieving the required vesting criteria 
since we have a limited base of employees and directors and have experienced minimal turnover  we do not apply a forfeiture rate 
when an employee terminates  we will record a change in accounting estimate that represents the difference between the expense recorded in the financial statements and the expense that would have been recorded based upon the rights to options that vested during the individual s service as an employee 
as of december   we had million of unrecognized compensation expense for employee and director options outstanding as of that date  which had a remaining weighted average vesting period of years 
non employees all stock option grants to consultants vest solely based upon continuing service  with the exception of a performance based award granted during for  shares and an award in december for  shares 
stock based compensation related to service based option grants to non employees is charged to expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the options  which approximates the period over which the related services are rendered  based on the fair value based measurement of the options using the black scholes option pricing model 
the assumptions used in these calculations are similar to those used for the determination of fair value based measurements for options granted to employees  with the exception that  for non employee options  we are required to use the remaining contractual term as the life of the option and the fair value based measurement related to unvested non employee options is re measured quarterly  based on the then current stock price as reflected on the nasdaq capital market 
for options with performance based vesting criteria  we recognize expense based on the minimum number of shares that will vest over time as the criteria are met based on the black scholes valuation of the vested shares 
long term obligation the accounting for the financing agreement with biopharma requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions  including the timing of royalty payments due to biopharma  the expected rate of return to biopharma  the split between current and long term portions of the obligation and the accretion of related interest expense 
korlym has only been marketed since april and the magnitude and timing of korlym revenue is difficult to predict 
therefore  these estimates and assumptions are subject to significant variability and are likely to change as we gain experience marketing korlym  which will result in changes in our classification of the current and long term portions of the amounts payable pursuant to this financing agreement  as well as the internal rate of return paid to biopharma and the accretion of interest expense related to this obligation 
actual payment amounts will be based on korlym receipts over the term of the financing agreement but in no event will the total amount paid to biopharma exceed million 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk of loss 
as of december   the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents was million and consisted primarily of money market funds maintained at major us financial institutions 
to minimize our exposure to interest rate risk  we have limited the maturities of our investments to less than two years with an average maturity not to exceed one year 
due to the short term nature of these instruments  a increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the total value of our portfolio as of december
