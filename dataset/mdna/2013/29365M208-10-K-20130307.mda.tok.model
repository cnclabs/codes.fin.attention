overview we are a development stage medical device company with approvals to commercially launch our product in australia  the european economic area and other countries that recognize the european ce mark 
we are focused on the design and development of devices that use neuroblocking technology to treat obesity  metabolic diseases and other gastrointestinal disorders 
our proprietary neuroblocking technology  which we refer to as vbloc therapy  is designed to intermittently block the vagus nerve using high frequency  low energy  electrical impulses 
we have a limited operating history and currently  we only have regulatory approval to sell our product in australia  the european economic area and other countries that recognize the european ce mark and do not have any other source of revenue 
our initial product is the maestro system  which uses vbloc therapy to affect metabolic regulatory control  limit the expansion of the stomach  help control hunger sensations between meals  reduce the frequency and intensity of stomach contractions and produce a feeling of early and prolonged fullness 
we were formerly known as beta medical  inc and were incorporated in minnesota on december  we later reincorporated in delaware on july  since inception  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the development and commercialization of our maestro system 
based on our understanding of vagal nerve function and nerve blocking from our preclinical studies and the results of our clinical trials  we believe the maestro system may offer obese patients a minimally invasive treatment that has the potential to result in significant and sustained weight loss 
we believe that our maestro system will allow bariatric surgeons to help obese patients who are concerned about the risks and complications associated with currently available restrictive and malabsorptive surgical procedures 
in addition  data from our vbloc dm enable trial outside the united states demonstrate that vbloc therapy may hold promise in improving obesity related comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension 
we are conducting  or plan to conduct  further studies in each of these comorbidities to assess vbloc therapy s potential in addressing multiple indications 
we continue to evaluate the maestro system in human clinical trials in the united states  australia  mexico  norway and switzerland 
to date  we have not observed any mortality related to our device or any unanticipated adverse device effects in these clinical trials 
we have also not observed any long term problematic clinical side effects in any patients  including in those patients who have been using the maestro system for more than one year 
in october  we received an unconditional investigational device exemption ide supplement approval from the us food and drug administration fda to conduct a randomized  double blind  sham controlled  multicenter pivotal clinical trial  called the recharge trial  testing the effectiveness and safety of vbloc therapy utilizing our second generation maestro rechargeable rc system 
enrollment and implantation in the recharge trial was completed in december in randomized patients implanted at centers 
all patients in the trial received an implanted device and were randomized in a allocation to treatment or control groups 
the control group received a non functional device during the trial period 
all patients were expected to participate in a weight management counseling program 
the primary endpoints of efficacy and safety were evaluated at months 
as announced on february   the recharge trial met its primary safety endpoint  though it did not meet its predefined co primary efficacy endpoints 
the trial did however demonstrate a clinically meaningful and statistically significant excess weight loss ewl of for vbloc therapy treated patients  with of patients achieving at least ewl 
as a result of the positive 
table of contents safety and efficacy profile of vbloc therapy  we plan to use the data from the recharge trial to support a premarket approval pma application for the maestro rechargeable system  which we anticipate filing during the second quarter of if the fda grants us approval  we anticipate we will be able to commercialize the maestro rechargeable system in the united states in if we obtain fda approval of our maestro rechargeable system we intend to market our products in the united states through a direct sales force supported by field technical and marketing managers who provide training  technical and other support services to our customers 
outside the united states we intend to use direct  dealer and distributor sales models as the targeted geography best dictates 
to date  we have relied on third party manufacturers and suppliers for the production of our maestro system 
we currently anticipate that we will continue to rely on third party manufacturers and suppliers for the production of the maestro system 
we obtained european ce mark approval for our maestro rechargeable system in in january  the final maestro rechargeable system components were listed on the australian register of therapeutic goods artg by the therapeutic goods administration tga 
we have been working closely with our australian distributor  device technologies australia pty limited  to bring the maestro rechargeable system to the australian market through a controlled commercial launch and made our first commercial shipment of the maestro rechargeable system to device technologies australia pty limited in march we also entered into an exclusive  multi year agreement with bader sultan brothers co 
wll for commercialization and distribution of the maestro rechargeable system in the gulf coast countries  including saudi arabia  kuwait  bahrain  qatar and the united arab emirates and made our first commercial shipments to bader sultan brothers co 
wll during the second quarter of we continue to explore additional select international markets to commercialize the maestro rechargeable system  including europe 
the method of assessing conformity with applicable regulatory requirements varies depending on the class of the device  but for our maestro system which is considered an active implantable medical device aimd in australia and the european economic area  and falls into class iii within the united states  the method involves a combination of self assessment by the manufacturer of the safety and performance of the device  and a third party assessment by a notified body  usually of the design of the device and of the manufacturer s quality system 
we use dekra certification bv formerly known as kema quality in the netherlands as the notified body for our ce marking approval process 
we have only recently begun to generate revenue from the sale of products  and we have incurred net losses in each year since our inception 
as of december   we had experienced net losses during the development stage of million 
although we recently received artg listings to sell our maestro rechargeable system in australia and european ce mark to sell our maestro rechargeable system in the european economic area and other countries that recognize the european ce mark  resulting in our first commercial sales in  we expect to incur significant sales and marketing expenses prior to recording sufficient revenue to offset these expenses 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to add the infrastructure necessary to support our initial commercial sales  operate as a public company and develop our intellectual property portfolio 
for these reasons  we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses for the next several years 
we have financed our operations to date principally through the sale of capital stock  debt financing and interest earned on investments 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k  we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to a full understanding and evaluation of our reported financial results 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title or risk of loss has passed  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
products are sold internationally through distributors and revenue is recognized upon sale to the distributor as these sales are considered to be final and no right of return or price protection exists 
terms of sales to international distributors are generally exw  reflecting that goods are shipped ex works  in which risk of loss is assumed by the distributor at the shipping point 
we do not provide for rights of return to customers on product sales and therefore do not record a provision for returns 
inventory since inception  inventory related purchases primarily have been used for research and development related activities and have accordingly been expensed as incurred 
in december  we began receiving artg listings for components of the maestro rechargeable system from the australian tga  with the final components being listed on the artg in january as a result  we determined certain assets were recoverable as inventory beginning in december and have recorded a current inventory balance of approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we account for inventory at the lower of cost or market and record any long term inventory as other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
there was approximately  and  of long term inventory as of december  and  respectively 
stock based compensation prior to january   we accounted for stock based employee compensation arrangements using the intrinsic value method and recognizing the expense over the option vesting period 
the intrinsic value method is calculated as the difference  if any  between the fair value of our common stock and the exercise price on the date of the grant 
we also followed the minimum value disclosure provisions 
using the intrinsic value method  we were not required to recognize stock based compensation expense for employee stock options granted from inception through as the exercise prices  for financial reporting purposes  were determined to be at or above the deemed fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of our common stock was assessed and approved by our board of directors  the members of which have extensive experience in the life sciences industry and all but one of whom are nonemployee directors 
in determining the appropriateness of the fair value of our common stock  the board of directors considered several factors  such as our life cycle  results of research and development  recent financings and financial projections 
effective january   we adopted the fair value method of accounting for share based payments  which superseded the previous accounting method  and requires compensation expense to be recognized using a fair value based method for costs related to all share based payments including stock options 
companies are required to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
we adopted the new provisions using the prospective transition method 
under this method  compensation cost is recognized for all share based payments granted or modified subsequent to december  all option grants valued after january  are expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
calculating stock based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  which represent our best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
estimates of stock based compensation expenses are significant to our consolidated financial statements  but these expenses are based on the black scholes pricing model and will never result in the payment of cash by us 

table of contents the application of share based payment principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among option valuation models  and this may result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of share based payment accounting in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the compensation expense that we record in the future may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating loss  net loss and net loss per share 
the fair value method is applied to all share based payment awards issued to employees and where appropriate  nonemployees  unless another source of literature applies 
when determining the measurement date of a nonemployee s share based payment award  the company measures the stock options at fair value and remeasures such stock options to the current fair value until the performance date has been reached 
for stock options granted to nonemployees  the fair value of the stock options is estimated using the black scholes valuation model 
this model utilizes the estimated fair value of common stock and requires that  at the date of grant and each subsequent reporting period until the services are completed or a significant disincentive for nonperformance occurs  we make assumptions with respect to the expected term of the option  the volatility of the fair value of our common stock  risk free interest rates and expected dividend yields of our common stock 
different estimates of volatility and expected life of the option could materially change the value of an option and the resulting expense 
common stock warrant liability effective january   we adopted new authoritative accounting guidance regarding the financial reporting for outstanding equity linked financial instruments 
this adoption required certain warrants issued by us to be recorded as a liability and recorded at fair value 
calculating the fair value of the warrant liability requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  which requires our best estimates  and involves inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
the common stock warrant liability and related changes in fair value are significant to our consolidated financial statements and is based on a weighted average black scholes valuation model  however the warrant liability will never result in the payment of cash by us 
net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards at december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
of this amount  approximately million is available after the application of internal revenue code irc section limitations  discussed below 
these net operating loss carryforwards will expire in varying amounts from through  if not utilized 
the irc imposes restrictions on the utilization of various carryforward tax attributes in the event of a change in ownership of the company  as defined by irc section in addition  irc section may limit the company s built in items of deduction  including capitalized start up costs and research and development costs 
during  we completed an irc section review and the results of this review indicate ownership changes have occurred which would cause a limitation on the utilization of carryforward attributes 
the company s gross net operating loss carryforwards  start up costs and research and development credits are all subject to limitation 
under these tax provisions  the limitation is applied first to any built in losses  then to any net operating losses and then to any general business credits 
the section limitation and accompanying recognized built in loss limitation is currently estimated to result in the expiration of million of our gross federal net operating loss carryforward  as well as a write off of million of capitalized start up costs  million of capitalized research and development costs  million of property and equipment and million of research and development credits 
an irc section review has not been completed since a valuation allowance has been established to reserve for the potential benefits of the remaining carryforwards and tax credits in our consolidated financial statements to reflect the uncertainty of future taxable income required to utilize available tax loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 

table of contents financial overview revenue we have received the european ce mark for our maestro rechargeable system  which enables commercialization in the european economic area and other countries that recognize the european ce mark 
in january  the final maestro rechargeable system components were listed on the artg by the australian tga and we have been working closely with device technologies australia pty limited to bring the maestro rechargeable system to the australian market through a controlled commercial launch and made our first commercial shipment of the maestro rechargeable system to device technologies australia pty limited in march we also entered into an exclusive  multi year agreement with bader sultan brothers co 
wll for commercialization and distribution of the maestro rechargeable system in the gulf coast countries  including saudi arabia  kuwait  bahrain  qatar and the united arab emirates and made our first commercial shipments to bader sultan brothers co 
wll during the second quarter of for the year ended december   we recognized  in revenue 
in the united states  we completed enrollment and device implantation in our recharge pivotal trial for obesity in december the primary endpoints of efficacy and safety were evaluated at months 
as announced on february   the recharge trial met its primary safety endpoint  though it did not meet its predefined co primary efficacy endpoints 
the trial did however demonstrate a clinically meaningful and statistically significant ewl of for vbloc therapy treated patients  with of patients achieving at least ewl 
as a result of the positive safety and efficacy profile of vbloc therapy  we plan to use the data from the recharge trial to support a premarket approval pma application for the maestro rechargeable system  which we anticipate filing during the second quarter of if the fda grants us approval  we anticipate we will be able to commercialize the maestro rechargeable system in the united states in any revenue from initial sales of a new product in the united states or internationally is difficult to predict and in any event will only modestly reduce our continued losses resulting from our research and development and other activities 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses primarily consist of engineering  product development and clinical and regulatory expenses  incurred in the development of our maestro system 
research and development expenses also include employee compensation  including stock based compensation  consulting services  outside services  materials  clinical trial expenses  including supplies  devices  explants and revisions  depreciation and travel 
we expense research and development costs as they are incurred 
from inception through december   we have incurred a total of million in research and development expenses 
with the completion of enrollment and device implantation in our recharge pivotal trial for obesity in late  research and development expenditures decreased in as costs were primarily associated with supporting the recharge trial in addition to the continued follow up on existing trials  such as vbloc dm enable and empower 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for executive  finance  market development and administrative personnel  including stock based compensation 
other significant expenses include costs associated with attending medical conferences  professional fees for legal  including legal services associated with our efforts to obtain and maintain broad protection for the intellectual property related to our products  and accounting services  cash management fees  consulting fees and travel expenses 
from inception through december   we have incurred million in selling  general and administrative expenses 

table of contents results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and sales 
sales were  for the year ended december   compared to no sales for the year ended december  the  of sales for the year ended december  were the result of beginning a controlled commercial launch of the maestro rechargeable system in australia and the gulf coast countries of the middle east with our first commercial shipments occurring in the first quarter of cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold were  for the year ended december   compared to no cost of goods sold for the year ended december  gross margin was for the year ended december  research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million  or  is primarily due to decreases of million and  in professional services and device costs  respectively 
the decreases in professional services and device costs are primarily the result of the completion of enrollments and device implantation in our recharge pivotal trial for obesity in late ongoing costs in were for follow up visits  which are significantly less than the implantation costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  is primarily due to an increase of million in compensation and benefits  including million in stock based compensation  and an increase of million in professional services 
the increase in compensation and benefits  including stock based compensation  is the result of increased staff to support international commercialization efforts as well as stock option grants made to management on july  the increase in professional services is also the result of international commercialization efforts 
interest expense 
interest expense was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
modifications to the loan agreement with silicon valley bank svb occurred in march and april the march loan modification reduced the interest rate from to with interest only payments through september  the principal balance was approximately million at the time of the modification 
the april loan modification increased the interest rate from to effective april  with interest only payments through march  the april loan modification resulted in the principal balance increasing from million to million 
comparison of the years ended december  and research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  is primarily due to increases of million   and  in professional services  device costs and travel  respectively 
the increases are primarily due to efforts in support of the recharge trial  including patient recruiting and the completion of enrollment and implantation in patients during selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of  or  is primarily due to increases of   and  in employee stock based compensation  professional services and compensation and benefits expense  respectively 
the increase in employee stock based compensation is primarily the result of granting million stock options during with a weighted average fair value of per share 
the increase in professional services and compensation and benefits was due to commercialization efforts in australia and additional select international markets 

table of contents interest expense 
interest expense was  for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of  or  was the result of a decrease in the gross principal balance outstanding from approximately million on december  to approximately million on december  and a modification to the loan agreement with svb that reduced our annual interest rate from to effective march  change in value of warrant liability 
there was no warrant liability during the year ended december  the value of the warrant liability decreased  for the year ended december  in the warrant liability consisted of warrants issued to compass horizon funding company llc horizon 
the fair market value of the remaining  warrants  with a weighted average exercise price of  was  as of may   the date on which the warrants down round protection expired 
the fair market value for these remaining warrants was calculated using the black scholes valuation model  which resulted in a decrease of  for the year ended december  as our stock price decreased from on december  to on may  liquidity and capital resources we have incurred losses since our inception in december and  as of december  we had experienced net losses during the development stage of million 
we have financed our operations to date principally through the sale of capital stock  debt financing and interest earned on investments 
through december   we had received net proceeds of million from the sale of common stock and preferred stock  including million from our initial public offering in november and million from public offerings  private placements and registered direct offerings in  and in addition  through december   we had received million in debt financing   to finance equipment purchases and million to finance working capital 
on april   we completed the sale of  shares of common stock in a registered direct offering at a purchase price of per share 
we received gross proceeds of million before deducting estimated offering expenses 
we have also received approximately million from the exercise of common stock warrants during the year ended december  on february   we closed a public offering  selling  shares of common stock  together with warrants to purchase approximately  shares of common stock at an aggregate price of per share and corresponding warrant  for gross proceeds of million before deducting offering expenses 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for a more detailed description of the public offering 
as of december  we had million in cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash 
of this amount million was invested in money market funds that are not considered to be bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance company or other government agency and  was invested in restricted cash collateral money market accounts as required by the terms of our lease agreement 
these money market funds seek to preserve the value of the investment at per share  however  it is possible to lose money investing in these funds 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in accordance with our investment policy  primarily with a view to liquidity and capital preservation 
at times  such deposits may be in excess of insured limits 
we have not experienced any losses on our deposits of cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that the cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash balance as of december   together with million in gross proceeds from the public offering completed february  and any interest income we earn on these balances  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements including scheduled or potentially accelerated debt obligations into  assuming we do not receive any other additional funds 
on november  we entered into a loan and security agreement with svb  venture lending leasing v  inc a private equity fund under the management of western technology investment wti and horizon  in an aggregate principal amount of up to million

pursuant to the loan and security agreement  svb has the right to require us to maintain a restricted cash balance of million in an svb account as a result of our not meeting the predefined primary efficacy measures of the recharge trial 
to date  svb has not exercised this right 
we may voluntarily prepay the term loan in full  but not in part  and any voluntary or mandatory prepayment is subject to applicable prepayment premiums and will also include the final payment fee 
we are required to comply with certain financial covenants that require us to generate certain minimum amounts of revenue from the sale of our maestro system and to implant certain minimum numbers of maestro systems during cumulative quarterly measurement periods beginning with the period ending march  and ending with the period ending june  if we fail to meet the financial covenants  the term loan will be in default 
we do not anticipate that we will be able to meet the financial covenants for the period ending march   and that we will attempt to renegotiate the terms of the loan and security agreement with svb 
if we are not able to renegotiate these terms we may be required to repay the million term loan and any associated fees 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included item of this annual report on form k for a more detailed description of the new loan and security agreement 
on october   we entered into a common stock purchase agreement the purchase agreement with terrapin opportunity  lp terrapin under which we may sell up to the lesser of million of common stock or  shares of our common stock over an approximately month period pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement 
we are not obligated to utilize any portion of the facility and we generally remain free to enter into and consummate other equity and debt financing transactions

if our available cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash balances are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek additional funding through our existing issuer managed equity financing facility with terrapin  sell additional equity or debt securities or enter into a credit facility 
obtaining funds through our existing issuer managed equity financing facility or through the sale of additional equity and debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
we may require additional capital beyond our currently forecasted amounts 
any such required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of  delay  or eliminate some or all of  our planned research  development and commercialization activities  which could materially harm our business 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations  the costs to complete development of products and the cost to commercialize our products are forward looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially and negatively as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed in part i  item a  risk factors  of this annual report on form k 
we have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of medical devices  such as our maestro system  we are unable to estimate the exact amounts of capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to complete the development of the products and successfully deliver a commercial product to the market 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to  the following the scope  rate of progress  results and cost of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost of any recalls or other field actions required either by us or by regulatory bodies in those countries in which we market our products  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our maestro system and any products that we may develop  the rate of market acceptance of our maestro system and vbloc therapy and any other product candidates  the cost of filing and prosecuting patent applications and defending and enforcing our patent and other intellectual property rights  the cost of defending  in litigation or otherwise  any claims that we infringe third party patent or other intellectual property rights

as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash 
the goals of our investment policy are preservation of capital  fulfillment of liquidity needs and fiduciary control of cash and investments 
we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
to achieve our goals  we may maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities of high credit quality 
the securities in our investment portfolio  if any  are not leveraged  are classified as either available for sale or held to maturity and are  due to their very short term nature  subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
because of the short term maturities of our cash equivalents  we do not believe that an increase in market rates would have any material negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio 
we have no investments denominated in foreign currencies and therefore our investments are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk
