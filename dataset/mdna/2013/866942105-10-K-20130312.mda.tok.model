the company sells its products globally through wholly owned subsidiaries and independent distributors 
sales outside the united states for the year ended december   were approximately of total net sales 
approximately two thirds of product sales are used by the mobile market  which is characterized by applications where the equipment is not fixed in place  the operating environment is often unpredictable and duty cycles are generally moderate to low 
some examples of the mobile market include equipment used in off road construction  agriculture  fire and rescue  utilities  oil fields  and mining 
the remaining one third of sales are used by industrial markets  which are characterized by equipment that is fixed in place  typically in a controlled environment  and which operates at higher pressures and duty cycles 
power units  automation machinery  metal cutting machine tools and plastics machinery are some examples of industrial equipment 
the company sells to both markets with a single product line 
in recent periods  the company s products have been used by emerging markets that have characteristics of both the mobile and industrial markets and do not conveniently fit either classification exclusively 
these markets include alternative energy equipment including wind  wave and solar equipment  animatronics and staging for theater and cinema 
the company sells to these markets the same products used in its traditional markets 
industry conditions demand for the company s products is dependent on demand for the capital goods into which the products are incorporated 
the capital goods industries in general  and the fluid power industry specifically  are subject to economic cycles 
according to the national fluid power association the fluid power industry s trade association in the united states  the united states index of shipments of hydraulic products increased  and in  and  respectively 
the company s order trend has historically tracked closely to the united states purchasing managers index pmi  with the pmi providing a six to ten months leading indication of business conditions 
a pmi above indicates economic expansion in the manufacturing sector and when below  it indicates economic contraction 
the index decreased to in december  from in december the index has remained relatively close to for most of the index in the early part of has increased with january at and february at this is the third consecutive month that the pmi has been above management believes the growth in the manufacturing sector is a positive sign for the company s business in business conditions in were erratic for the capital goods industry and our business 
the first half of the year was very strong  led by north american demand 
sales for the year were bolstered by the addition of hct sales acquired in november of and pricing actions 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in demand and currency transactions 
the decline in demand was most notable in our european and asian markets throughout the year 
the demand weakness also occurred in domestic markets in the second half of the year  as business conditions deteriorated 
while we continue to add new customers in all regions  including at a faster rate in asia and europe  it was not enough to offset the effects of the general economic decline in our existing customer base 
as business conditions improve  management believes our now larger client base in all regions will lead to business growth and greater market penetration 
as we have demonstrated in the past  we are able to respond to increases in demand and consistently ship product on time to the customer s requested ship date 
our focus is on satisfying customers today  without losing focus of our long term goals 
this is why we began construction of a third manufacturing facility in the us in the spring of this facility will provide added flexibility and capacity to meet anticipated higher demand levels in the future 
providing the right products in a timely fashion continues to strengthen sun s brand and differentiate us from others in our industry

there is still a lot of uncertainty in the macro economy  but management believes things appear to be settling down a bit 
our first quarter forecast indicates a sequential rebound in demand led by asia and europe 
as our existing customers business rebounds in china and europe  with the new customers we have added  management expects to see the top line continue to grow
