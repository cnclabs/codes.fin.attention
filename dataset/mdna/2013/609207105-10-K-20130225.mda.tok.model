table of contents critical accounting policies note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee 
the following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates  as well as the accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include mondel z international  as well as our wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries 
the majority of our operating subsidiaries report results as of the last saturday of the year 
a portion of our international operating subsidiaries report results as of the last calendar day 
in  the last saturday of the year fell on december  so our results included one more week of operating results rd week than or  which each had weeks 
in  we changed the consolidation date for certain operations of our europe segment and in the latin america  central and eastern europe cee and middle east and africa mea regions within our developing markets segment 
previously  these operations primarily reported results two weeks prior to the end of the period 
subsequent to the changes  our europe segment reports results as of the last saturday of each period 
certain operations within our developing markets segment now report results as of the last calendar day of the period or the last saturday of the period 
these changes and the rd week in resulted in a favorable impact to net revenues of million and a favorable impact of million to operating income in in  we changed the consolidation date for certain european biscuits operations  which are included within our europe segment  and certain operations in asia pacific and latin america within our developing markets segment 
previously  these operations primarily reported period end results one month or two weeks prior to the end of the period 
europe moved the reporting of these operations to two weeks prior to the end of the period  and asia pacific and latin america moved the reporting of these operations to the last day of the period 
these changes resulted in a favorable impact to net revenues of million and a favorable impact of million to operating income in we believe these changes are preferable and will improve business planning and financial reporting by better matching the close dates of the operating subsidiaries within our europe and developing markets segments and by bringing the reporting dates closer to the period end date 
as the effect to prior period results was not material  we have not revised prior period results 
we account for investments in which we exercise significant influence ownership interest under the equity method of accounting 
we use the cost method of accounting for investments in which we have an ownership interest of less than and in which we do not exercise significant influence 
noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries consists of the equity interest of noncontrolling investors in consolidated subsidiaries of mondel z international 
all intercompany transactions are eliminated 
use of estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect a number of amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
significant accounting policy elections  estimates and assumptions include  among others  pension and benefit plan assumptions  valuation assumptions of goodwill and intangible assets  useful lives of long lived assets  marketing program accruals  insurance and self insurance reserves and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
if actual amounts differ from estimates  we include the revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period in which we know the actual amounts 
historically  the aggregate differences  if any  between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we value all our inventories using the average cost method 
we also record inventory allowances for overstocked and obsolete inventories due to ingredient and packaging changes 

table of contents long lived assets we review long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets  for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
we perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists 
when testing for impairment of assets held for use  we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable 
if an impairment is determined to exist  the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value 
impairment losses on assets to be disposed of  if any  are based on the estimated proceeds to be received  less costs of disposal 
in  we recorded impairment charges of million within the restructuring program 
we did not record any asset impairments in in  we recorded an impairment of million for certain property  plant and equipment in a biscuit plant in france 
goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets we test goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets for impairment at least annually on october we assess goodwill impairment risk by first performing a qualitative review of entity specific  industry  market and general economic factors for each reporting unit 
if significant potential goodwill impairment risk exists for a specific reporting unit  we apply a two step quantitative test 
the first step compares the reporting unit s estimated fair value with its carrying value 
we estimate a reporting unit s fair value using a year projection of discounted cash flows which incorporates planned growth rates  market based discount rates and estimates of residual value 
for reporting units within our north america and europe geographic units  we used a market based  weighted average cost of capital of to discount the projected cash flows of those operations 
for reporting units within our developing markets geographic unit  we used a risk rated discount rate of 
estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans  industry and economic conditions 
our actual results and conditions may differ over time 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s net assets exceeds its fair value  the second step is applied to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  the goodwill is considered impaired and reduced to its implied fair value 
in  and  there were no impairments of goodwill 
in connection with our annual impairment testing  we noted two reporting units which were more sensitive to near term changes in discounted cash flow assumptions us confections with  million of goodwill as of december  and fair value in excess of its carrying value of net assets of and europe biscuits with  million of goodwill as of december  and fair value in excess of its carrying value of net assets of 
while the reporting units passed the first step of the impairment test  if the segment operating income or another valuation assumption for either reporting unit were to deteriorate significantly in the future  it could adversely affect the estimated fair value 
if we are unsuccessful in our plans to increase the profitability of these businesses  the estimated fair values could fall further and lead to a potential goodwill impairment in the future 
we test non amortizable intangible assets for impairment by first performing a qualitative review by assessing events and circumstances that could affect the fair value or carrying value of the indefinite lived intangible asset 
if significant potential impairment risk exists for a specific non amortizable intangible asset  we quantitatively test for impairment by comparing the fair value of each intangible asset with its carrying value 
fair value of non amortizable intangible assets is determined using planned growth rates  market based discount rates and estimates of royalty rates 
if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value  the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to its estimated fair value 
we record intangible asset impairment charges within asset impairment and exit costs 
during our review of non amortizable intangible assets  we recorded million of charges related to a trademark on a japanese chewing gum product within our developing markets segment which had significantly lower revenue 
the fair value of the intangible asset was determined under a relief of royalty valuation  which models the cash flows from the trademark assuming royalties were received under a licensing arrangement 
the charge was calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the intangible asset over its estimated fair value and was recorded within asset impairment and exit costs 
during our review  there were no impairments of non amortizable intangible assets 
during our review  we recorded a million charge for the impairment of intangible assets in the netherlands and a million charge for the impairment of intangible assets in china 
insurance and self insurance we use a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks  including workers compensation  general liability  automobile liability  product liability and our obligation for employee health care benefits 
we estimate the liabilities associated with these risks by evaluating and making judgments about historical claims experience and other actuarial assumptions and the estimated impact on future results 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenues when title and risk of loss pass to customers  which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery of goods 
revenues are recorded net of consumer incentives and trade promotions and include all shipping and handling charges billed to customers 
our shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of sales 
provisions for product returns and customer allowances are also recorded as reductions to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized 
marketing and research and development we promote our products with advertising  consumer incentives and trade promotions 
these programs include  but are not limited to  discounts  coupons  rebates  in store display incentives and volume based incentives 
we expense advertising costs either in the period the advertising first takes place or as incurred 
consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated due to customers and consumers at the end of a period 
we base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates 
for interim reporting purposes  advertising and consumer incentive expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of volume  based on estimated volume and related expense for the full year 
we do not defer costs on our year end consolidated balance sheet and all marketing costs are recorded as an expense in the year incurred 
advertising expense was  million in   million in  and  million in we expense product research and development costs as incurred 
research and development expense was million in  million in  and million in we record marketing and research and development expenses within selling  general and administrative expenses 
environmental costs throughout the countries in which we do business  we are subject to local  national and multi national environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
we have programs across our business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements 
in the united states  the laws and regulations include the clean air act  the clean water act  the resource conservation and recovery act and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla 
cercla imposes joint and severable liability on each potentially responsible party 
as of december   our subsidiaries were involved in one active proceeding in the us under a state equivalent of cercla related to our current operations 
as of december   our subsidiaries were involved in active actions 
except for the one active proceeding we retained  all the remaining active actions relate to and were retained by the divested kraft foods group business 
as of december   we accrued an immaterial amount for environmental remediation 
based on information currently available  we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our financial results 
employee benefit plans we provide a range of benefits to our current and retired employees 
depending on jurisdictions  tenure  presence of a union  job level and other factors  these include pension benefits  postretirement health care benefits and postemployment benefits  consisting primarily of severance 
we record amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by us gaap 
these calculations require the use of various actuarial assumptions  such as discount rates  assumed rates of return on plan assets  compensation increases  turnover rates and health care cost trend rates 
we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
as permitted by us gaap  we generally amortize any effect of the modifications over future periods 
we believe that the assumptions used in recording our plan obligations are reasonable based on our experience and advice from our actuaries 
refer to note  benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the assumptions used 
in connection with the spin off  we transferred to kraft foods group  the plan liabilities and assets associated with the kraft foods group active and retired employees and certain of our retired employees that previously participated in our north american benefit plans 
at october   we transferred benefit plan liabilities of  million  pension plan assets of  million  accumulated other comprehensive losses  net of tax  of  million and  million of related deferred tax assets 
we also expect annual pension expenses to decrease by million in connection with certain of our north american benefit plan obligations which were transferred to kraft foods group in the spin off 

table of contents we recorded the following amounts in earnings from continuing operations for these employee benefit plans during the years ended december   and in millions us pension plan cost non us pension plan cost postretirement health care cost postemployment benefit plan cost employee savings plan cost multiemployer pension plan contributions multiemployer medical plan contributions net expense for employee benefit plans the net expense for employee benefit plans of million increased by million over the amount  primarily related to higher amortization of the net loss from experience differences related to the us and us pension plans 
the net expense for employee benefit plans of million increased by million over the amount  primarily related to higher amortization of the net loss from experience differences related to the us pension plans and the incorporation of a canadian postemployment plan into our obligations 
we expect our net expense for employee benefit plans to decrease by approximately million 
the decrease is primarily due to non recurring costs in related primarily to certain benefit plan obligations transferred to kraft foods group in the spin off and other one time costs  partially offset by increased benefit plan expenses in due to lower discount rates 
in  other comprehensive losses included  million of net actuarial pre tax losses primarily related to the decrease in the discount rate utilized to determine our pension plan benefit obligations at december  basis point decrease for us plans and basis point decrease for non us plans and the decrease in the discount rate utilized to determine our postretirement benefit obligations at december  basis point decrease for us plans and basis point decrease for our non us plans 
in  other comprehensive losses included  million of net actuarial pre tax losses primarily related to the decrease in the discount rate utilized to determine our pension plan benefit obligations at december  basis point decrease for us plans and basis point decrease for non us plans  unfavorable differences between our expected and actual return on pension plan assets and the decrease in the discount rate utilized to determine our postretirement benefit obligations at december  basis point decrease for us plans and basis point decrease for our non us plans 
in  other comprehensive earnings included million of net actuarial pre tax losses primarily related to the decrease in the discount rate utilized to determine our pension plan benefit obligations at december  basis point decrease for us plans and basis point decrease for non us plans and the decrease in the discount rate utilized to determine our postretirement benefit obligations at december  basis point decrease for us plans and basis point decrease for our non us plans  partially offset by favorable differences between our expected and actual return on pension plan assets 
in  we contributed million to our us pension plans including million related to kraft foods group us pension plans and million to our non us pension plans including million related to kraft foods group non us pension plans 
in addition  employees contributed million to our non us plans 
of our pension contributions  million was voluntary including million related to kraft foods group pension plans 
we make contributions to our us and us pension plans  primarily  to the extent that they are tax deductible and do not generate an excise tax liability 
in  we estimate that our pension contributions will be million to our us plans and million to our us plans based on current tax laws 
we are currently only required to make a nominal cash contribution to our us qualified pension plans under the pension protection act of of the total pension contributions  none is expected to be voluntary 
our actual contributions may be different due to many factors  including changes in tax and other benefit laws  significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates  or other factors 
for salaried and non union hourly employees hired in the us after january   we discontinued benefits under our us pension plans  and we replaced them with an enhanced company contribution to our employee savings plan 
additionally  we will be freezing the us pension plans for current salaried and non union hourly employees effective december  
table of contents for our postretirement plans  our health care cost trend rate assumption increased to from for our us postretirement plans and increased to from for our non us postretirement plans 
we established these rates based upon our most recent experience as well as our expectation for health care trend rates going forward 
we anticipate that our health care cost trend rate assumption will be for us plans by and for us plans by assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans 
a one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects on our costs and obligation as of december  one percentage point increase decrease effect on total of service and interest cost effect on postretirement benefit obligation our discount rate assumption decreased to from for our us postretirement plans and decreased to from for our non us postretirement plans 
our discount rate decreased to from for our us pension plans 
we model these discount rates using a portfolio of high quality  fixed income debt instruments with durations that match the expected future cash flows of the benefit obligations 
our discount rate assumption for our non us pension plans decreased to from 
we developed the discount rates for our non us plans from local bond indices that match local benefit obligations as closely as possible 
changes in our discount rates were primarily the result of changes in bond yields year over year 
our expected rate of return on plan assets decreased to from for our us pension plans 
we determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets historical long term investment performance  current asset allocation and estimates of future long term returns by asset class 
we attempt to maintain our target asset allocation by rebalancing between asset classes as we make contributions and monthly benefit payments 
our expected rate of return on plan assets decreased to from for our non us pension plans 
we determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets historical long term investment performance  current asset allocation and estimates of future long term returns by asset class 
while we do not anticipate further changes in the assumptions for our us and us pension and postretirement health care plans  as a sensitivity measure  a fifty basis point change in our discount rates or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects  increase decrease in cost  as of december  us plans us plans fifty basis point fifty basis point increase decrease increase decrease in millions effect of change in discount rate on pension costs effect of change in expected rate of return on plan assets on pension costs effect of change in discount rate on postretirement health care costs financial instruments we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency exchange rate  commodity price and interest rate risks 
we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results 
a principal objective of our risk management strategies is to reduce significant  unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and interest rates  principally through the use of derivative instruments 
we use a combination of primarily foreign currency forward contracts  futures  options and swaps  commodity forward contracts  futures and options  and interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to cash flow variability  protect the value of our existing foreign currency assets and liabilities and protect the value of our debt 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the types of derivative instruments we use 

table of contents we record derivative financial instruments at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets within other current assets or other current liabilities due to their relatively short term duration 
cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows based on the nature of the derivative instrument 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge  to the extent that the hedge is effective  are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive earnings losses and reclassified to earnings when the hedged item affects earnings 
changes in fair value of economic hedges and the ineffective portion of all hedges are recognized in current period earnings 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a fair value hedge  along with the changes in the fair value of the related hedged asset or liability  are recorded in earnings in the same period 
we use foreign currency denominated debt to hedge a portion of our net investment in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates  with changes in the value of the debt recorded within currency translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive earnings losses 
in order to qualify for hedge accounting  a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the derivative instrument and the item being hedged must exist at inception and throughout the hedged period 
we must also formally document the nature of and relationship between the derivative and the hedged item  as well as our risk management objectives  strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction and method of assessing hedge effectiveness 
additionally  for a hedge of a forecasted transaction  the significant characteristics and expected term of the forecasted transaction must be specifically identified  and it must be probable that the forecasted transaction will occur 
if it is no longer probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will occur  we would recognize the gain or loss related to the derivative in earnings 
when we use derivatives  we are exposed to credit and market risks 
credit risk exists when a counterparty to a derivative contract might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the contract 
we minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with high quality  investment grade credit ratings  limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties 
we also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant  non exchange traded derivative contracts with a duration of one year or longer are governed by an international swaps and derivatives association master agreement 
market risk exists when the value of a derivative or other financial instrument might be adversely affected by changes in market conditions and foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  or interest rates 
we manage market risk by limiting the types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies we use and the degree of market risk that we plan to hedge through the use of derivative instruments 
income taxes we recognize tax benefits in our financial statements when uncertain tax positions are assessed more likely than not to be sustained upon audit 
the amount we recognize is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we recognize deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences  operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of the deferred tax assets will not be realized

table of contents commodity trends we purchase large quantities of commodities  including sugar and other sweeteners  coffee  cocoa  wheat  corn products  soybean and vegetable oils and dairy 
in addition  we use significant quantities of packaging materials to package our products and natural gas  fuels and electricity for our factories and warehouses 
we regularly monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these commodities so we can act quickly to obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production 
significant cost items in biscuit  chocolate  gum candy and many powdered beverage products are sugar and cocoa 
we purchase sugar and cocoa on world markets  and the prices of these commodities are affected by the quality and availability of supply and changes in foreign currencies 
significant cost items in our biscuit products are grains wheat  corn and soybean oil 
grain costs have experienced volatility and have increased significantly in recent years due largely to burgeoning global demand for food  livestock feed and biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel and other factors such as weather 
the most significant cost item in coffee products is green coffee beans which we purchase on world markets as well as from local grower cooperatives 
green coffee bean prices are affected by the quality and availability of supply  changes in the value of the us dollar in relation to certain other currencies and consumer demand for coffee products 
significant cost items in packaging include cardboards  resins and plastics and our energy costs include natural gas  electricity and diesel fuel 
we purchase these packaging and energy commodities on world markets and within the countries we operate  and the prices are affected by supply and changes in foreign currencies 
during  our aggregate commodity costs increased primarily as a result of increased packaging  energy  grains and oil costs 
we expect the price volatility and a slightly higher cost environment to continue over the remainder of we have addressed higher commodity costs primarily through higher pricing  lower manufacturing costs due to our end to end cost management program and overhead cost control 
we expect to continue to use these measures to address further commodity cost increases 
external factors such as weather conditions  commodity market conditions  currency fluctuations and the effects of governmental agricultural programs affect the prices for raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products 
we use hedging techniques to limit the impact of price fluctuations in our principal raw materials 
however  we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices  and these strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs 
while the prices of our principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate  we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from numerous sources 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we believe that our cash from operations  our existing billion revolving credit facility which supports our commercial paper program and our authorized long term financing will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs  planned capital expenditures  future contractual obligations and payment of our anticipated quarterly dividends 
we continue to maintain investment grade credit ratings on our debt 
we continue to utilize our commercial paper program and primarily uncommitted international credit lines for regular funding requirements 
we also use intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility 
overall  we do not expect any negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity  including the permanent reinvestment of our foreign earnings 
net cash provided by operating activities operating activities provided net cash of  million in   million in and  million in the decrease in operating cash flows in was primarily related to higher spending associated with spin off costs and the restructuring program  partially offset by lower net working capital costs primarily related to favorable inventory positions due to higher inventory costs in and favorable accounts payable positions  partially offset by increased receivables 
the increase in operating cash flows in is primarily related to increased earnings and the absence of tax payments in the prior year in connection with kraft foods group s frozen pizza divestiture  partially offset by higher working capital mainly higher inventory costs  increased interest payments and increased integration program spending and a million voluntary contribution to our us pension plans

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as we operate globally  we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency exchange rate  commodity price and interest rate risks 
we monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program 
our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results 
we maintain foreign currency  commodity price and interest rate risk management policies that principally use derivative instruments to reduce significant  unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and interest rates 
we also sell commodity futures to unprice future purchase commitments  and we occasionally use related futures to cross hedge a commodity exposure 
we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and  by policy  do not use financial instruments for speculative purposes 
refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements for further details of our foreign currency  commodity price and interest rate risk management policies and the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge those exposures 
value at risk we use a value at risk var computation to estimate the potential one day loss in the fair value of our interest rate sensitive financial instruments  and the potential one day loss in pre tax earnings of our foreign currency and commodity price sensitive derivative financial instruments 
we included our debt  foreign currency forwards and futures  swaps and options  and commodity futures  forwards and options in our var computation 
excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions  foreign currency trade payables and receivables  and net investments in foreign subsidiaries  which the abovementioned instruments are intended to hedge 
we made the var estimates assuming normal market conditions  using a confidence interval 
we used a variance co variance model to determine the observed interrelationships between movements in interest rates and various currencies 
these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and forward currency rate movements over the prior quarter for the calculation of var amounts at december  and  and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average var amounts during each year 
the values of foreign currency and commodity options do not change on a one to one basis with the underlying currency or commodity  and were valued accordingly in the var computation 
as of december   the estimated potential one day loss in fair value of our interest rate sensitive instruments  primarily debt  and the estimated potential one day loss in pre tax earnings from our foreign currency and commodity instruments  as calculated in the var model  were in millions pre tax earnings impact fair value impact at average high low at average high low instruments sensitive to interest rates foreign currency rates commodity prices pre tax earnings impact fair value impact at average high low at average high low instruments sensitive to interest rates foreign currency rates commodity prices with the spin off  a significant portion of our primarily us derivative instruments were divested in the fourth quarter of the impacts presented in the table above have not been recast to reflect the divestiture for periods prior to the spin off as it is impracticable to do so 
this var computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum probable daily loss from adverse movements in interest rates  foreign currency rates and commodity prices under normal market conditions 
the computation does not represent actual losses in fair value or earnings we will incur  nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates 
we cannot predict actual future movements in such market rates and do not present these var results to be indicative of future movements in such market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future financial results
