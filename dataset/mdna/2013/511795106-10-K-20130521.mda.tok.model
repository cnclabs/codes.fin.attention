item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following summary together with the more detailed business information and consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this form k and in the documents that we incorporate by reference into this form k 
this document may contain certain forward looking information within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of this information involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
overview fy was a challenging year for management 
the company lost an officer contract dispute where we had substantial documentary evidence that the officer in question had breached his employment contract with lakeland 
nonetheless  a brazilian arbitration panel awarded this officer a million judgment against lakeland 
according to our local counsel  arbitration decisions in brazil are very difficult to successfully appeal 
subsequently  lakeland successfully negotiated the judgment down to million of which million was payable over six years with no interest 
as of april   the remaining liability associated with this arbitration judgment is million and is payable at  a quarter over the next years  with no interest 
in addition  the brazilian government devalued its currency by in which greatly reduced our margins in brazil on imported fabrics 
declining sales in fy led to quarterly losses in brazil  which led to the necessity of writing off all goodwill  certain intangibles  and deferred tax assets of brazil 
these factors led to a default on the td bank loan  which in turn created substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
thus  we engaged with new lenders and considered other options  such as the sale of the company  the sale of assets which has occurred  and a refinance of the td bank loan 
in may  the company accepted a commitment letter from a bank for a senior credit facility subject to certain terms and conditions and is currently working towards closing this financing 
however  no assurance can be given that this transaction or any other transaction will be consummated 
we will continue pursuing all options to maximize stockholder value 
as a result of the default under the td bank loan  and the risk that such loan could be called as immediately due and payable  we were unable to conclude that we would have the capital to continue our operations through january  successful completion of the proposed new financing  in management s opinion  would relieve this condition 
we manufacture and sell a comprehensive line of safety garments and accessories for the global industrial protective clothing markets 
our products are sold by our in house sales force and independent sales representatives to a network of over  north american safety and mill supply distributors and end users and distributors internationally 
these distributors in turn supply end user industrial customers  such as integrated oil  utilities  chemical petrochemical  automobile  steel  glass  construction  smelting  janitorial  pharmaceutical and high technology electronics manufacturers 
in addition  we supply federal  state and local governmental agencies and departments domestically and internationally  such as municipal fire and police departments  airport crash rescue units  the military  the department of homeland security and the centers for disease control and state and privately owned utilities and integrated oil companies 
we have operated facilities in mexico since  in china since  in india since now discontinued and in brazil since may beginning in  we moved the labor intensive sewing operation for our limited use disposable protective clothing lines to these facilities 
our facilities and capabilities in china and mexico allow access to a less expensive labor pool than is available in the united states and permit us to purchase certain raw materials at a lower cost than they are available domestically 
as we have increasingly moved production of our products to our facilities in mexico and china  we have seen improvements in the profit margins for these products 
we have completed the process of moving of production of our reusable woven garments and gloves to these facilities by the second quarter of fy our net sales from continuing operations attributable to customers outside the united states were million and million in fy and fy  respectively 
we anticipate r d expenses remaining flat at  in fy compared to fy this is due largely to expenses for a development project that we incurred in fy coupled with the anticipated elimination of several projects as a part of our product rationalization process  which is ongoing 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base estimates on our past experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and we periodically evaluate these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
going concern 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the accrual method of accounting in accordance with gaap and have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business 
we have sustained substantial operating losses since in fy and we are in default with our lender  td bank 
during the year ended january   we had a net loss of million 
these factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we expect to continue to incur substantial additional operating losses from our brazilian operations for at least the first half of fy unless we are able to have in place a new credit facility  we believe that our current cash position of million  our cash flow from operations and  borrowing in brazil and the united kingdom  may not be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated operating  capital expenditures and debt service requirements for at least the next months 
to this end  in may  the company accepted a commitment letter from a bank for a senior credit facility subject to certain terms and conditions and is currently working towards closing this financing 
however  no assurance can be given that this transaction or any other transaction will be consummated 
if management is unable to successfully implement its cost reduction strategies or to complete any other financing  that would impact our ability to continue as a going concern 
revenue recognition 
the company derives its sales primarily from its limited use disposable protective clothing and secondarily from its sales of high end chemical protective suits  firefighting and heat protective apparel  gloves and arm guards and reusable woven garments 
sales are recognized when goods are shipped  at which time title and the risk of loss pass to the customer 
some sales in brazil may be sold on terms with fob destination  which are recognized when received by the customer 
sales are reduced for sales returns and allowances 
payment terms are generally net days for united states sales and net days for international sales 
inventories 
inventories include freight in  materials  labor and overhead costs and are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
inventory is written down for slow moving  obsolete or unusable inventory 
in the year ended january   the company changed its estimate used in calculating slow moving inventory in the us 
previously  the company reserved for any item in excess of years stock on hand based on annualized sales levels 
the company has determined that based on its needs to service customers  up to a two year supply may be needed 
therefore  the company now writes down anything in excess of a two year supply 
the change in estimate resulted in an additional write down of  at january  most foreign operations consider inventory obsolete or slow moving when more than one year supply exists 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
trade accounts receivable are stated at the amount the company expects to collect 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
management considers the following factors when determining the collectability of specific customer accounts customer creditworthiness  past transaction history with the customer  current economic industry trends and changes in customer payment terms 
past due balances over days and other less creditworthy accounts are reviewed individually for collectability 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  adversely affecting their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
based on management s assessment  the company provides for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance 
balances that remain outstanding after the company has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable 
income taxes and valuation allowances 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
this involves estimating the actual current tax in addition to assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments for tax and financial accounting purposes 
these differences  together with net operating loss carry forwards and tax credits  are recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities on our balance sheet 
a judgment must then be made of the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income 
a valuation allowance may be required to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we determine that we may not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future  or that new estimates indicate that a previously recorded valuation allowance is no longer required  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset is charged or credited to net income in the period of such determination 
uncertain tax positions 
in the event the company determines that it may not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  or that new estimates indicate that a previously recorded valuation allowance is no longer required  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset is charged or credited to income in the period of such determination 
the company recognizes tax positions that meet a more likely than not minimum recognition threshold 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and indefinite lived  intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually  however  these tests may be performed more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
goodwill impairment is evaluated utilizing a two step process as required by us gaap 
factors that the company considers important that could identify a potential impairment include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the overall business strategy  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the company measures any potential impairment on a projected discounted cash flow method 
estimating future cash flows requires the company s management to make projections that can differ materially from actual results 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from the asset are separately identifiable and are less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset 
foreign currency risks 
the functional currency for the brazil operation is the brazil real  the united kingdom  the euro  the trading company in china  the renminbi  the canada real estate  the canadian dollar  and the russia operation  the russian ruble and kazakhstan tenge 
all other operations have the us dollar as its functional currency 
self insured liabilities 
we have a self insurance program for certain employee health benefits 
the cost of such benefits is recognized as expense based on claims filed in each reporting period and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported during such period 
our estimate of claims incurred but not reported is based upon historical trends 
if more claims are made than were estimated or if the costs of actual claims increase beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient  and additional accruals may be required in future periods 
we maintain separate insurance to cover the excess liability over set single claim amounts and aggregate annual claim amounts 
results of operations the following table sets forth our historical results of continuing operations for the years ended january   and  as a percentage of our net sales from continuing operations 
year ended january  net sales from continuing operations cost of goods sold from continuing operations gross profit from continuing operations operating expenses from continuing operations operating profit loss from continuing operations interest expense  vat tax charge  settlement of arbitration award and other income  net income tax expense benefit from continuing operations net income loss from continuing operations significant balance sheet fluctuation january   as compared to january  balance sheet accounts 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents of million is primarily the result of normal fluctuations in cash management 
inventories decreased million primarily due to sell off of remaining tyvek inventory by january   overall inventory reduction program and the sale of inventory in brazil built up for the navy contract 
the decrease in intangibles and goodwill of million is due to the write down of these assets in brazil 
the decrease of million in the current deferred tax assets is due to the creation of a valuation allowance for such accounts 
the borrowing in brazil was used for working capital 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents of million is primarily the result of careful cash management to enable brazilian arbitration settlement payments through cash generated by current assets and liabilities  inventory and payables management 
trade payables increased in fy due to increased purchases of materials in china  argentina and chile with longer payment terms and cash management in the us 
year ended january   compared to the year ended january  for the year for the three months ended january  audited ended january  unaudited net sales from continuing operations gross profit from continuing operations operating expenses from continuing operations operating profit loss from continuing operations income loss before tax from continuing operations net income loss from continuing operations net sales 
net sales from continuing operations decreased million  or  to million for the year ended january   compared to million for the year ended january  the net decrease was mainly due to a million decrease in domestic sales  partially offset by a million increase in foreign sales 
the net decrease in the us was comprised mainly of a decrease in us disposables sales  resulting from the loss of the tyvek license from dupont 
this decrease in us sales was offset by significant increases in foreign sales  including a million increase in sales by qualytextil  sa in brazil  a million increase in european sales and a million growth in combined chile and argentina sales 
external sales from china were flat for the fourth quarter fy but were up for the full year 
sales in brazil have decreased in qfyand we expect next fiscal year s sales to be lower in brazil 
net sales from continuing operations in q fy increased by million  or  to million from q of fy this increase was due to an increase in foreign sales  from million in q fy to million in q fy of these amounts  sales in brazil were million and million for q of fy and fy  respectively 
for purposes of the management s discussion  the reference to q shall mean quarter 
thus q means the second quarter of the applicable fiscal year 
gross profit 
gross profit from continuing operations decreased million  or  to million for the year ended january   from million for the year ended january  gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the year ended january   from for the year ended january  the major factors driving the changes in gross margins were 
del del 
disposables gross margin increased by percentage points in fy compared with fy this increase was mainly due to changes in the sales mix to primarily lakeland branded products this year  while last year had more than of north american disposable sales were sales of dupont products at a lower margin 
this year s margin was lower than it otherwise would be as a result of lower volume and an increase in inventory reserves against tyvek items remaining 
brazil gross margin was for this year compared with last year  primarily due to issues with a contract with the brazilian navy 
the brazilian currency weakened significantly earlier in the year  thereby greatly increasing the cost of material purchased from a usa supplier 
further  due to the length of time elapsed since the bid was submitted in respect of the navy contract  there were increases in the material cost  along with a need to change certain components at a higher cost 
there were also similar issues with several utility contracts 
glove margins increased percentage points primarily from improved product mix 
chemical margins were decreased by percentage points due to different sales mix 
canada gross margin decreased by percentage point primarily due to discounting remaining tyvek inventory 
uk margins decreased by percentage points primarily from higher volume from larger sales at lower margins 

del del 
argentina margins decreased by percentage points due to lack of capital 

del del 
chile margins increased by percentage points as a result of stronger sales mix 
operating expenses 
operating expenses from continuing operations increased million  or  to million for the year ended january   from million for the year ended january  as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses increased to for the year ended january   from for the year ended january  the increase in operating expenses in the year ended january   as compared to the year ended january   included million increase in sales salaries due to the hiring of additional sales people to support growth in the us  asia  and south america 
million increase in commissions  of which million was in brazil  relating to higher commissions on large bid contracts delivered in q q of fy million increase in sales administrative salaries due to increase in customer service capacity in alabama 
million increase in insurance due to increased claims experience 
million increase in employee benefits due to increase in unemployment expense 
million increase in bad debt resulting from one large account in chile 
million increase in professional fees as a result of the issues in brazil 
million decrease in administrative salaries  which includes a million accrual for the contract termination of the president of the brazilian subsidiary offset against million reduction in administrative salaries in brazil  throughout the year  which is the result of our efforts to reduce costs 
employees in administration and sales were terminated in brazil in fy a new law was passed in brazil resulting in lower payroll taxes  officers in brazil took a payroll cut for two quarters  and the depreciated currency resulted in lower payroll expense in brazil 
million decrease in research and development due to large r d expenses in fy million in decreased freight out expense due to more consolidated shipping and better management oversight 
operating profit loss 
operating profit loss from continuing operations decreased by million to million from million for the prior year 
operating profit as a percentage of net sales decreased for the year ended january   from for the year ended january   primarily due to sharply lower volume in disposables in the us due to the termination of the company s tyvek and tychem supply agreement by dupont  a million charge for contract termination of the president of the brazilian subsidiary  issues in brazil with the navy and other contracts caused by a currency devaluation earlier in the year and weak volume in brazil  mainly due to lack of large bid contracts in q of fy without brazil s fy operating loss of million  the company would have had operating income of million 
interest expense 
interest expense increased by million for the year ended january   compared to the year ended january   because of term loan borrowing in to fund capital expansion in brazil and mexico outstanding throughout fy and also borrowing in brazil at higher rates prevailing in brazil and the us 
further  the company paid higher interest rates on its td facility in fy as a result of several amendments during fy other expenses net 
the increase in other expenses resulted mainly from the million write down of goodwill in brazil and the million arbitration settlement  with two of the former owners of the company s subsidiary in brazil 
income tax expense 
income tax expenses from continuing operations consist of federal  state and foreign income taxes 
income tax expense increased million to million for the year ended january   from million for the year ended january  our effective tax rate was meaningless for the fiscal years ended january  and our effective tax rate varied from the federal statutory rate of due primarily to the million arbitration settlement in brazil  which did not get a tax benefit  million goodwill write off in brazil and the establishment of a million valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
our income taxes in the current year were benefited by losses in the us and a check the box us tax benefit from the losses in india at a higher rate than most of the foreign income 
further  there was a million valuation allowance charged to tax expense this year relating to the deferred tax asset 
net income loss 
net income loss from continuing operations decreased million to a loss of million for the year ended january   from million for the year ended january  the decrease in net income was primarily a result of arbitration settlement and goodwill impairment charge in brazil see notes and for full discussion 
fourth quarter results continuing operations the sales in brazil in q of fy and fy had no large bid sales and were approximately the same as prior year 
the increase in sales in other foreign jurisdictions is primarily due to the introduction of new products and new marketing material targeting specific markets 
factors effecting qfy results included a goodwill impairment charge of million in brazil 
million separation accrual in brazil for a departing executive 
a loss of million on foreign exchange in brazil 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax in the amount of million 
we continue to see price increases in our chinese manufacturing operations with labor source availability a concern 
as a result of general elections in the fourth quarter  the public tenders were very weak in brazil across all markets throughout the quarter resulting in weaker sales 
in q we began initiatives to right size the brazilian operation 
this initiative is expected to be complete in q fy about of the severance and labor reductions costs were recognized in november and january of q lakeland europe and lakeland china both experienced strong q sales closing fy with record sales for each division 
discontinued operations in qfy  the company commenced its efforts to market its property in india 
based on the difficulty in marketing this property in qfy  the company determined carrying value exceeded projected undiscounted cash flows and recorded a loss of  to reduce carrying value to future value 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows as of january   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million  an increase of million and a decrease of million  respectively  from january  we have operations in many foreign jurisdictions which may place restrictions on repatriation of cash to the us 
we are planning various strategies to mitigate this issue 
our primary sources of funds for conducting our business activities have been from cash flow provided by used in operations and borrowings under our credit facilities described below 
much of our cash is overseas and not readily available 
we require liquidity and working capital primarily to fund increases in inventories and accounts receivable associated with our net sales and  to a lesser extent  for capital expenditures 
the decrease in working capital was primarily due to the reclassification of the td bank loan outstanding balances from long term in fy to current liabilities in fy net cash provided by continuing operating activities of million for the year ended january   was due primarily to net loss of million  offset by noncash charges of million for the arbitration award less million payments and fees  noncash million goodwill impairment charge in brazil and million valuation allowance for deferred tax noncash charge  an increase in receivables of million  a decrease in inventory of million and increased payables of million 
net cash used in continuing operating activities of million for the year ended january   was due primarily to a net loss of million  an increase in receivables of million and decreased payables of million 
net cash used in investing activities of million and million in the years ended january  and  respectively  was due to the purchases and improvements to property and equipment in both years  in fiscal mainly in china and mexico  and in fiscal mainly due to capital expansions in brazil and mexico 
net cash used in financing activities in the years ended january  and was primarily new borrowings under the term loan facility to fund the brazilian and mexican expansions  payments of million  pursuant to the brazil settlement agreement and borrowings in brazil 
credit facility as of january  we had one credit facility a million credit facility with td bank  expiring in june  including a revolver and term loans  of which we had borrowing outstanding under the revolver as of january  amounting to million  expiring in june and a term loan facility of which we had million outstanding as of january  as a result of the arbitration award issued against the company in may and the subsequent entry into a settlement agreement the brazilian settlement agreement in respect thereof  as well as due to the recent operating results of the company mentioned below  one or more events of default have occurred during the year under the td bank revolving credit facility and term loan facility  including an event of default for failure to comply with the minimum ebitda covenant  which allow td bank  at its option  to accelerate the loan 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at the london interbank offering rate libor plus basis points and were at january  our td bank credit facility requires that we comply with specified financial covenants relating to interest coverage  debt coverage  minimum consolidated net worth and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
these restrictive covenants could affect our financial and operational flexibility or impede our ability to operate or expand our business 
default under our credit facilities allows the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
our lenders have a security interest in substantially all of our assets to secure the debt under our credit facilities 
on may   the company accepted a commitment letter from a bank for a senior credit facility subject to certain terms and conditions and is currently working towards closing this financing 
however  no assurance can be given that this transaction or any other transaction will be consummated 
unless we are able to have in place a new credit facility  we believe that our current cash position of million  our cash flow from operations and  borrowing in brazil and the united kingdom  may not be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated operating  capital expenditures and debt service requirements for at least the next months 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures principally relate to purchases of building and equipment in brazil and mexico  manufacturing equipment  computer equipment and leasehold improvements 
we anticipate fy capital expenditures to be approximately million 
our facilities in china are not encumbered by commercial bank mortgages and  thus  chinese commercial mortgage loans or the sale of a facility may be available with respect to these real estate assets if we need additional liquidity 
there are no further specific plans for material capital expenditures in the fiscal year during fythe anqui city  china weifang lakeland factory expanded its operations substantially to accommodate the movement of the work in a leased facility  whose lease had expires 
by bringing the two factories together  economies of scale were achieved 
contractual obligations we had no off balance sheet arrangements at january  as shown below  at january   our contractual cash obligations totaled approximately million  including lease renewals entered into subsequent to january  payments due by period total one year or less years years years years after years canada facility loan    term loans td bank   borrowings in brazil   operating leases    other liabilities   revolving credit facility   brazil arbitration settlement   total     the td facility is reflected as amended in october see note to the financial statements included in this form k recent accounting developments the company considers the applicability and impact of all accounting standards updates asus 
asus not listed below were determined to either not be applicable or to have a minimal impact on the consolidated financial statements 
the fasb has issued accounting standards update asu no 
 comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  to improve the transparency of reporting these reclassifications 
other comprehensive income includes gains and losses that are initially excluded from net income for an accounting period 
those gains and losses are later reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into net income 
the amendments in this asu do not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements 
all of the information that this asu requires already is required to be disclosed elsewhere in the financial statements under us gaap 
the new amendments will require an organization to present either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes the effects on the line items of net income of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income but only if the item reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
cross reference to other disclosures currently required under us gaap for other reclassification items that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified directly to net income in their entirety in the same reporting period 
this would be the case when a portion of the amount reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income is initially transferred to a balance sheet account eg  inventory for pension related amounts instead of directly to income or expense 
the amendments apply to all public and private companies that report items of other comprehensive income 
public companies are required to comply with these amendments for all reporting periods interim and annual 
the amendments are effective for reporting periods beginning after december   for public companies and are effective for reporting periods beginning after december   for private companies 
early adoption is permitted 
the fasb has issued accounting standards update asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
this asu states that an entity has the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
if  after assessing the totality of events and circumstances  an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  then the entity is not required to take further action 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount in accordance with codification subtopic  intangibles goodwill and other  general intangibles other than goodwill 
under the guidance in this asu  an entity also has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test 
an entity will be able to resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
the amendments in this asu are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  early adoption is permitted  including for annual and interim impairment tests performed as of a date before july   if a public entity s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued or  for nonpublic entities  have not yet been made available for issuance 
the fasb has issued accounting standards update asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
asu is intended to simplify how entities  both public and nonpublic  test goodwill for impairment 
asu permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described in topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 
asu is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted  including for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed as of a date before september   if an entity s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued or  for nonpublic entities  have not yet been made available for issuance 
the fasb has issued its us gaap financial reporting taxonomy implementation guide subsequent events 
the guide is the first in a series of xbrl implementation guides  which are designed to help taxonomy users understand how certain disclosures are structured within the taxonomy 
the purpose of the implementation guide is to demonstrate the modeling for disclosures required about events occurring subsequent to the end of a public company s reporting period 
the modeling has been completed using the elements in the taxonomy 
the examples are not intended to encompass all of the potential modeling configurations or to dictate the appearance and structure of a company s xbrl documents 
in addition to the implementation guide  the fasb also issued definition components structure  the first style guide of the fasb us gaap financial reporting taxonomy style guide series 
also available on the fasb website  the style guides provide additional insight into design criteria and are offered as a reference for users of the taxonomy 
the us gaap financial reporting taxonomy is a list of computer readable tags in xbrl that allows companies to tag precisely the thousands of pieces of financial data that are included in typical long form financial statements and related footnote disclosures 
the tags allow computers to automatically search for  assemble  and process data so it can be readily accessed and analyzed by investors  analysts  journalists  and regulators 
in early  the financial accounting foundation assumed maintenance responsibilities for the taxonomy  and  along with the fasb  assembled a team of technical staff dedicated to updating the taxonomy for changes in us gaap  identifying best practices in taxonomy extensions  and technical enhancements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our purchases and sales in other countries 
to manage the volatility relating to foreign currency exchange rates  we seek to limit  to the extent possible  our non us dollar denominated purchases and sales 
in connection with our operations in china  we purchase a significant amount of products from outside of the united states 
however  our purchases in china are primarily made in chinese yuan  the value of which had been largely pegged to the us dollar for the last decade 
however  the chinese yuan has been decoupled from the us dollar and allowed to float by the chinese government and  therefore  we have been exposed to additional foreign exchange rate risk on our chinese raw material and component purchases 
our primary risk from foreign currency exchange rate changes is presently related to non us dollar denominated sales in brazil  canada and europe and  to a smaller extent  in other south american countries and dollar denominated payables in brazil 
our sales to customers in brazil are denominated in brazilian reals  in canada in canadian dollars and in europe in euros and british pounds 
if the value of the us dollar increases relative to the canadian dollar  the real  the pound or the euro  then our net sales could decrease as our products would be more expensive to these international customers because of changes in rate of exchange 
the largest supplier of raw materials to brazil is an american company  and these payables are denominated in us dollars 
if the brazilian real weakened against the us dollar  it would make our costs higher and trigger a loss on foreign exchange on the payables 
our sales from china are denominated in the chinese yuan  us dollar and euros 
we did experience some losses between the chinese yuan  the euro and us dollars in fy  but we have since stepped up our hedging program to include this risk 
we manage the foreign currency risk through the use of rolling day forward contracts against the canadian dollar and euros and through longer term cash flow hedges in china against the usd and euro 
we also do limited short term hedging of the brazilian real 
we do not hedge other currencies at this time 
as non us dollar denominated international purchases and sales grow  exposure to volatility in exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
the only significant unhedged foreign exchange exposure we have is the brazilian real 
other unhedged currency exposure is not significant 
if the brazilian exchange rates varied either way by it could cause a gain loss to p l of interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to our credit facilities  which have variable interest rates based upon the london interbank offered rate 
at january   we had million in borrowings outstanding under this credit facility 
if the interest rate applicable to this variable rate debt rose in the year ended january   our interest expense would have increased by approximately million
