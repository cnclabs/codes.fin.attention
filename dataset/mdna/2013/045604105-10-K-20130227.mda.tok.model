overview 
we are engaged primarily in the ownership and operation of multifamily residential units 
our subsidiary  merit enterprises  inc merit  is a general contractor that acts as our in house construction division 
during the year ended december   our primary sources of cash and revenue from operations were rents from the leasing of our apartment units  which represented of our consolidated revenue for the year 
the operating performance of our properties is affected by general economic factors including  but not limited to  household formation  job and wage growth  unemployment rates  population growth  immigration  the supply of new multifamily rental communities and  in certain markets  the supply of other housing alternatives  such as condominiums  single and multifamily rental homes and owner occupied single and multifamily homes 
additionally  our performance may be affected by the access to  and cost of  debt and equity 
rental revenue collections are impacted by rental rates and occupancy levels 
we use lro tm  a rental revenue software product that provides comprehensive submarket based statistical data to assist in maximizing rental revenue while remaining market competitive 
we combine this data with our proprietary market knowledge and experience in our efforts to maximize rental revenues and maintain high occupancy levels 
we expect lro tm to continue to assist us in generating long term rent growth and asset stability with daily  incremental rent changes 
we adjust our rental rates in our continuing effort to adapt to changing market conditions and maximize rental revenue 
we continuously monitor physical occupancy and net collected rent per unit to track our success in maximizing rental revenue 
these indicators are more fully described in the results of operations comparison 
additionally  we consider property noi  ffo and ffo as adjusted to be important indicators of our overall performance 
property noi property revenue less property operating and maintenance expenses is a measure of the profitability of our properties and has the largest impact on our financial condition and operating results 
ffo is used by real estate investment trusts as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of real estate companies because it excludes charges such as real estate depreciation and amortization of intangible assets that are generally considered not to be reflective of the actual value of real estate assets over time 
additionally  gains and losses from the sale of most real estate assets and certain other items are excluded from ffo 
see selected financial data presented in part ii  item of this report on form k for reconciliations of property noi  ffo and ffo as adjusted to consolidated net income loss in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
our same community portfolio includes properties that we have owned and operated for the entire two year period ending december  and consists of properties containing  units 
our same community portfolio accounted for of total revenue and of our property noi in acquired development properties represent four properties acquired in  a unit development in nashville  tennessee completed and stabilized in and three properties acquired in see results of operations for an additional discussion of our same community properties 
same community property noi increased in compared to primarily as a result of a million or increase in property noi from our midwest ohio  michigan and indiana portfolio 
our mid atlantic maryland  metro dc and virginia portfolio property noi increased million or  our southeast georgia and florida portfolio property noi increased  or  and our southwest texas portfolio property noi increased or  in the following table presents property noi results for and year ended december  in thousands property noi property noi variance same community properties midwest mid atlantic southeast southwest total same community acquired properties development total property noi our earnings guidance anticipates the acquisition of zero to million of properties and the disposition of million to million of properties 
additionally  our development spend is expected to be approximately million to million  and includes the completion of the unit expansion to our san raphael property in dallas 
we intend to continue to evaluate potential property acquisitions and development opportunities within our investment criteria 
we also may sell properties where market conditions are such that the reinvestment of cash proceeds derived from a sale are expected to provide  over time  a significantly greater return on equity  an increase in cash flow or further enhance our strategic objectives 
we will continue to focus on the ratio of our total debt to gross real estate assets which was at december  compared with at december   and the level of secured debt to gross real estate assets  which was at december  compared to at december  we will also continue to focus on our fixed charge coverage ratio  which improved to times at december  from times at december  in order to maximize property noi  we plan to continue our efforts toward improving revenue  controlling costs and realizing operational efficiencies at the property level  both regionally and portfolio wide 
in  at the midpoint of our guidance  we expect same community property noi to increase  driven by a increase in property revenue and a increase in property operating expenses compared to the increase in revenue will primarily be due to maintaining physical occupancy levels and from increased rental rates 
however  the uncertainties caused by economic and financial conditions complicate our ability to forecast future performance 
we believe that the apartment industry is better situated to weather a slow growing or recessionary environment or a delayed recovery than other real estate sectors because people will normally choose shelter over discretionary spending such as going to the mall or hotel stays 
government sponsored agencies such as fannie mae and freddie mac continue to provide attractive apartment financing  which may be unavailable to other commercial real estate sectors 
our expectations could be adversely impacted if recessionary forces resume or if congress curtails fannie mae or freddie mac financing support to the apartment industry 
moreover  unless and until sustained job and wage growth occurs in our markets  significant continued rental growth may be limited 
federal income taxes 
we have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended  commencing with our taxable year ending december  reits are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that of the income that would otherwise be considered as taxable income be distributed to shareholders 
providing we continue to qualify as a reit  we will generally not be subject to federal income tax on net income 
a reit is precluded from owning more than of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer  other than a wholly owned subsidiary or another reit  and more than of the value of all securities of any one issuer 
as an exception to this prohibition  a reit is allowed to own up to of the securities of a taxable reit subsidiary trs that can provide non customary services to reit tenants and others without disqualifying the rents that a reit receives from its tenants 
however  no more than of the value of a reit total assets can be represented by securities of one or more trs 
the amount of intercompany interest and other expenses charged in transactions between a trs and a reit are subject to arms length allocation requirements contained in the code and treasury regulations 
we believe we have qualified and plan to  and believe we will  continue to qualify as a reit  however  qualification is subject to the satisfaction of numerous highly technical and complex requirements 
we cannot  therefore  guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify in the future as a reit

in january  we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement  that among other things  increased the maximum amount of borrowings under our unsecured revolver to million  extended the maturity date to january  and provided for a one year extension option 
additionally  the amended and restated credit agreement provides for an increase of the total facility to million upon our request and the agreement of the lenders participating in the facility 
our borrowing capacity under the revolver is a function of our unencumbered property pool 
as of february   the maximum amount of borrowings available to us under the revolver was million and borrowings outstanding totaled million 
on october   we completed modifications to our unsecured term loan which included increasing the outstanding principal amount to million from million and extending the maturity date from june to january total costs associated with this modification were  during  we sold  shares under our million at the market atm program for total gross proceeds of million  or million net of sales and commissions and other costs 
the proceeds were used to reduce borrowings on our unsecured revolver and for general corporate purposes 
at june   all million of common shares available for issuance under the atm had been sold and the program was completed 
in august  we registered an atm program allowing us to sell up to million of our common shares in open market transactions at the then market price per share 
there were no shares sold during under this program 
our ability to access the capital markets affords us additional liquidity as demonstrated by our sale of  of our common shares in an underwritten public offering in june the net proceeds from this offering  which totaled approximately million  were used to fund property acquisitions and development and for general corporate purposes 
as of the filing date  equity and or debt securities of up to million remain available for public offerings under our current shelf registration statement which expires in june on january   we completed the issuance of million of unsecured senior notes

the million total issuance has a weighted average term of years at a weighted average interest rate of 
proceeds from the issuance were used to repay borrowings under the unsecured revolver  including amounts borrowed in december to repay two mortgages totaling approximately million 
cash flow provided by operations increased million when comparing to the increase was primarily due to a increase in same community property noi and the contribution from the four properties acquired during  the three properties acquired during and the completion and lease up of our vista germantown development in cash flow provided by operations increased million when comparing to the increase was primarily due to an increase in property noi as a result of the acquisition of four properties during  the completion of a unit expansion at one of our existing properties and the acquisition of three additional properties during shelf availability 
we have a shelf registration statement that relates to the offering  from time to time  of debt securities including convertible debt  preferred shares  depositary shares  common shares and common share warrants 
the amount of securities originally registered under this registration statement was million and it expires in june securities and or debt offerings up to million are currently available under this shelf registration statement 
as of the filing date of this document  we qualify as a well known seasoned issuer and intend to file a new shelf registration statement that will be effective upon filing prior to the expiration of the existing shelf 
liquidity normal business operations 
we anticipate that we will meet our normal business operations and liquidity requirements for the upcoming year generally through net cash provided by operations 
we believe that if net cash provided by operations is below projections  other sources such as the unsecured revolver and secured and unsecured borrowings are or can be made available and should be sufficient to meet our normal business operations and liquidity requirements 
liquidity non operational activities 
sources of cash available for repayment of debt  any property acquisitions and funding other capital expenditures are expected to be provided primarily by proceeds from the refinancing of debt borrowings  our unsecured revolver  the sale of properties and possibly the sale of common shares 
the development of the unit expansion of san raphael apartments will be financed from our unsecured revolver 
additionally  we anticipate that the development of our planned turtle creek apartment community in dallas  our bethesda development in maryland and our desmond development in los angeles will be funded from some combination of property sale proceeds  construction financings  borrowings on our unsecured revolver or the sale of common shares

property revenue increased in compared to primarily as a result of an increase of million contributed by the acquired and development properties 
property revenue for compared to for the same community properties increased million primarily due to an increase in net rents and a decline in the amount of vacancy losses 
management and service company revenue 
the management and service company revenues declined  when comparing to effective during  we terminated our remaining property and asset management contracts and exited the third party management business 
therefore  we will no longer be reporting management fee revenue 
property operating and maintenance expenses 
property operating and maintenance expenses increased million when comparing to this increase was primarily due to property operating and maintenance expenses for the acquired and development properties increasing million and the same community properties increasing million when comparing the two years 
property operating and maintenance expenses increased million when comparing to this increase was primarily due to an increase of million related to the properties acquired in and depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased million when comparing to this increase was primarily due to an increase of approximately million in depreciation due to the acquired and development properties and an increase of million in amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquired properties 
this was partially offset by a million reduction in amortization of intangibles for the same community properties 
the intangible assets  consisting primarily of relationships with residents under month leases  are being amortized over a month period 
depreciation and amortization increased million when comparing to this increase was primarily due to an increase of approximately million in depreciation due to the acquired and development properties and an increase of million in amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with the properties acquired during the intangible assets are being amortized over a month period for residential leases 
the million intangible asset recorded in conjunction with the acquisition of an office building in is being amortized over the life of the lease  which is months 
direct property management and service company expenses 
direct property management and service company expenses decreased  in compared to due to our terminating all property and asset management contracts and exiting the third party management business  as referenced above 
construction and other services 
in  we decided to exit the third party construction services business  and at december   we had substantially completed our work under all third party construction contracts 
we continue to provide general contracting and construction management services for our own account in connection with the development of multifamily properties we will own and operate 
during and  merit worked on ten projects for third parties 
revenues for were in line with revenues earned in  while expenses increased by approximately million primarily as a result of additional construction costs incurred for certain rehabilitation projects subject to guaranteed maximum price contracts 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million when comparing to this increase was primarily due to increases in payroll resulting from higher incentive compensation awards 
interest expense 
there were no significant interest expense variances when comparing to interest expense increased million when comparing to the increase was primarily due to the following interest on mortgage loans secured by same community properties declined million as a result of the prepayment of seven loans in totaling million and five loans in totaling million 
interest expense on mortgage loans secured by acquired properties increased million due to the addition of two loans totaling million in and a million loan in additionally  interest expense in connection with our unsecured revolver and unsecured term loan increased million due to increased borrowings on the unsecured revolver throughout when compared to and the closing of the unsecured term loan in june furthermore  our weighted average interest rate declined to at december  from at december  income from discontinued operations 
included in discontinued operations for the years ended december  and are the operating results and the gains related to six wholly owned properties that were sold in and two wholly owned properties that were sold in also included in is a gain on insurance recoveries of  net of our deductible  which resulted from the settlement of windstorm damage at one of the properties sold in for further details on income from discontinued operations  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements presented in part ii  item of this report on form k 
preferred share repurchase costs 
on june   we redeemed all of our class b series ii cumulative redeemable preferred shares at a cost of approximately million  plus accrued and unpaid dividends through the redemption date 
in connection with the issuance of the class b preferred shares in december  we incurred approximately million in issuance costs and recorded such costs as a reduction to shareholders equity 
we recognized the million of issuance costs as a reduction in net earnings in computing our net loss applicable to common shares for the year ended december  inflation 
we believe that the effects of inflation only minimally impact our operational performance because our leases are mostly for month terms  which allow us the opportunity to increase our new lease and lease renewal rents to account for inflationary price increases 
we are careful to account for inflationary factors that may impact our development projects  however  there can be no assurance that inflation will not result in development costs exceeding original estimates in future periods 
see item a risk factors 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements include accounts of all subsidiaries  our two taxable reit subsidiaries  the operating partnership structured as a downreit that owns one of our operating properties in florida and the partnership in which we were a partner that owns our development property in nashville  tennessee and a partnership in which we are a partner that owns our development property in bethesda  maryland 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these consolidated financial statements  we have utilized information available including industry practice and our own past history in forming estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
it is possible that the ultimate outcome that we anticipated in formulating the estimates inherent in these consolidated financial statements may not materialize 
as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of other companies in similar businesses 
we have identified four critical accounting policies 
these critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates 
with respect to these critical accounting policies  management believes that the application of judgments and estimates is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented 
the four critical accounting policies are impairment of long lived assets 
our held for investment real estate assets are assessed for impairment if current events or circumstances  such as significant adverse changes in general market conditions  decreases in property net operating income  or reductions in expected future cash flows  indicate that the carrying value cost less accumulated depreciation may not be recoverable 
factors we consider in evaluating impairment of real estate assets held for investment include estimated future growth rates  capitalization rates  occupancy assumptions  current expectations regarding the holding period for the individual assets  and external data to the extent available 
should the estimates used change  impairment may result which could materially impact our results of operations 
we review goodwill annually and whenever there is an impairment indicator 
in performing this analysis  we use a multiple of revenues to the range of potential alternatives and assign a probability to the various alternatives we consider 
should estimates used to determine the alternatives considered or the probabilities of the occurrence thereof change  impairment may result which could materially impact our results of operations 
share based compensation 
we estimate the fair value of share based compensation awarded 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the stock options  and the monte carlo method to estimate the fair value of restricted share awards in which the number of shares that will ultimately vest are subject to market conditions 
the use of judgment and or estimates is required in determining certain of the assumptions used by these valuation models  such as volatility of share prices and forfeitures of awards 
if we had used different judgment and or estimates  different valuations would have been produced that may have resulted in a material change to our results of operations 
we also estimate future performance results related to certain share based awards 
if the results vary from our estimate  it may require us to make a material adjustment to our results of operations 
real estate taxes 
we estimate the amount of real estate taxes  for which we will be liable  based upon assumptions relating to possible changes in millage rates and property value reassessments 
in most circumstances  the actual millage rates or reassessment values are not available until the following reporting period and  consequently  these rates or values could differ from assumptions and require material adjustments to the liabilities recorded 
acquisitions of investment properties 
we allocate the purchase price of properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values 
in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price  we utilize a number of sources  including analysis provided by an advisor  independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the applicable property  our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data 
we amortize intangible assets associated with multifamily acquisitions  consisting primarily of relationships with residents under month leases  over months and had we determined different estimates it could have resulted in the recognition of different expense amounts 
contingencies environmental 
we have reviewed tangible long lived assets and other agreements for associated asset retirement obligations aros and have determined that we do not have any material aros that would require recognition as a liability or disclosure in our financial statements at december  phase i environmental audits were obtained at the time of our initial public offering in  or property acquisition and or property refinancing  as applicable  on all of our owned properties 
future claims for environmental liabilities are not measurable given the uncertainties surrounding whether there exists a basis for any such claims to be asserted and  if so  whether any claims will  in fact  be asserted 
pending litigation 
for a discussion of pending litigation  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements presented in part ii  item of this report on form k 
while there can be no assurance  we are not aware of any pending or threatened litigation which is likely to result in a material adverse liability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk
