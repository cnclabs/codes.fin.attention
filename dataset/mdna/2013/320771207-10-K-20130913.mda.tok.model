table of contents for a detailed description of our product and service offerings  see business overview included in item of this annual report 
loan processing and origination during the first quarter of fiscal  we began providing services for two lender clients related to school certified education loan programs  including originating education loans  based on our monogram platform 
during fiscal  we began performing services for union federal related to school certified education loan programs based on our monogram platform  including a k loan program 
in june  we launched a monogram based loan program with a new lender client and  in august  we launched a monogram based loan consolidation program with an existing client 
our monogram platform continues to provide us with an opportunity to originate  administer  manage and finance education loans  and our lender clients monogram based loan programs are a significant component of our return to the education financing marketplace 
the education loans that we originate on behalf of our partnered lending clients  excluding our subsidiary union federal  are not included on our consolidated balance sheets but  rather are included on the balance sheets of our partnered lending clients 
as such  none of the references in this annual report to education loans included on our consolidated balance sheets include the education loans processed by us on behalf of our partnered lending clients 
in october  we began to process and disburse education loans through cology llc on behalf of its credit union and other lender clients 
cology llc earns fees primarily based on the number of loan applications  loan certifications and disbursements it processes on behalf of its clients 
because cology llc is a loan processer  the education loans that it processes on behalf of its clients are not included on our consolidated balance sheets but  rather  are included on the balance sheets of its clients 
as such  none of the references in this annual report to education loans included on our consolidated balance sheets include the education loans processed by cology llc on behalf of its clients 
the following table presents our loan facilitation data with respect to our monogram based programs for fiscal and  as well as the education loans processed by cology llc for the period since the date of acquisition through june  we use the term facilitated loan to mean an education loan that has been approved following receipt of all applicant data  including the signed credit agreement  required certifications from the school and applicant and any required income or employment verification 
we use the term disbursed loan to mean a loan for which loan funds have been disbursed on behalf of the lender 
fiscal fiscal partnered lending union federal monogram loan programs total cology llc since acquisition total partnered lending union federal monogram loan programs total dollars in thousands facilitated loans disbursed loans historically  we have processed the greatest monogram based loan application volume during the summer and early fall months  as students and their families seek to borrow money in order to pay tuition costs for the fall semester or the entire academic year 
the following table represents our loan origination metrics with respect to our monogram based programs held at union federal at june  and june  weighted average fico score co signers delinquent loans the weighted average fico score is based on the maximum score of the borrower or co signer at origination 

table of contents portfolio performance credit performance of consumer related loans generally has been adversely affected by general economic conditions in the united states over the past four years 
these conditions have included higher unemployment rates and deteriorating credit performance  including higher levels of education loan defaults and lower recoveries on such defaulted loans 
although these conditions have lessened to a certain extent recently  they may have a material adverse effect on consumer loan portfolio performance in the future 
our monogram based education loan portfolios are not yet fully exposed to significant adverse portfolio performance because a majority of these portfolios have yet to experience any significant seasoning 
consequently  in evaluating loan portfolio performance  we review projected gross default rates and projected post default recovery rates 
further  we evaluate the loan portfolio performance of the securitization trusts that we previously facilitated 
the service revenue receivables from these trusts that remain on our consolidated balance sheets at june  and june  have not been significantly impacted by defaults or recoveries since these trusts possess guarantees that help to partially negate the overall impact of any default activity 
many of these securitization trusts are also cash flowing  seasoned portfolios that  for the most part  have relatively short remaining weighted average lives 
capital markets we believe that conditions in the capital markets generally improved in fiscal compared to recent years 
in particular  investors in abs demonstrated increased interest in abs backed by private education loans  resulting in a reduction in credit spreads applicable to these securities 
additionally  during the third quarter of fiscal  a private education loan abs issuance by a third party included a subordinate bond  the first such bond to be included in a new issuance since the inclusion of this subordinate bond served to increase the advance rate  or amount of funds raised as a percentage of the collateral in the issuance 
we believe that these trends during fiscal indicate that the economics of private education loan abs are starting to become more attractive to issuers in the private education loan securitization marketplace 
however  we have not completed a securitization transaction since fiscal and if we execute a financing transaction in the capital markets  the structure and economics of any such transaction may be materially different from prior transactions that we have sponsored 
such differences may include lower revenues as a result of comparatively wider credit spreads and lower advance rates 
uncertainties our near term financial performance and future growth depends  in large part  on our ability to successfully and efficiently market our monogram platform  cology llc offerings and tms offerings so that we may grow and diversify our client base and revenues 
facilitated and disbursed loan volumes are key elements of our financial results and business strategy  and we believe that the results from the and the academic years demonstrate market demand for monogram based education loans 
we have invested in our distribution capabilities over the course of the past two years  including our school sales force and tms  but we face challenges in increasing loan volumes 
for example  competitors with larger customer bases  greater name or brand recognition  or more established customer relationships than those of our clients  have an advantage in attracting loan applicants at a lower acquisition cost than us and making education loans on a recurring  or serialized  basis 
outlook our long term success depends on our ability to attract additional lender clients  or otherwise obtain additional sources of interim or permanent financing  such as securitizations or alternative financing transactions 
this is particularly true as the level of loan originations for the union federal private student loan program is subject to regulatory limits that are based upon the overall size of union federal s balance sheet and union federal s capital levels  as determined by fmd 
to date  we have entered into education loan program agreements based on our monogram platform with four lender clients  including fmd s subsidiary union federal 
while we have demonstrated market demand for monogram based education loans  we are uncertain as 
table of contents to the degree of market acceptance that our monogram platform will achieve  particularly in the current economic environment where lenders continue to evaluate their education lending business models 
additionally  as one of our four partnered lending clients provides the majority of our monogram based loan program fees  we are subject to concentration risk as it relates to this revenue stream until we are able to attract additional lender clients 
we believe  however  that the credit quality characteristics and interest rates of the loan portfolios originated in the and the academic years will be attractive to additional potential lender clients  as well as capital markets participants 
we also believe that the ability to permanently finance private education loan portfolios through the capital markets would make our products and services more attractive to lenders and would accelerate improvement in our long term financial results 
we are uncertain of the volume of education loans to be generated by the monogram based loan programs of our four lender clients  or any additional lender clients  including clients acquired through our acquisition of a substantial portion of the operating assets of the cology sellers in october it is our view that returning to profitability will be dependent on a number of factors  including our loan capacity and related volumes  expense management and growth at tms  cology llc and union federal  and the availability of financing alternatives  including our ability to successfully re enter the securitization market 
in particular  we need to generate loan volumes substantially greater than those that we have generated to date  as well as to develop funding capacity for monogram based loan programs at loan volume levels greater than those of our four lender clients with lower credit enhancement levels and higher capital markets advance rates than those available today 
we must also continue to achieve efficiencies in attracting applicants  through loan serialization or otherwise  in order to reduce our overall cost of acquisition 
in the case of cology llc  we expect to continue to provide loan processing services to the former customers of the cology sellers similar to the services provided to them by the cology sellers prior to the asset acquisition 
in addition  we hope to provide various monogram based products and services to these customers to assist them in education loan product design  pricing  marketing  reporting and analysis  as well as education loan portfolio management services 
changes in any of the following factors could materially affect our financial results demand for education financing  which may be affected by changes in limitations established by the federal government on the amount of federal loans that a student can receive  the terms and eligibility criteria for loans and grants under federal or state government programs and legislation currently under consideration  the extent to which our services and products  including our monogram platform  cology llc offerings and tms offerings  gain market share and remain competitive at pricing favorable to us  the amount of education loan volume disbursed under our lender clients monogram based loan programs  our ability to sell monogram products and services to cology llc s customers  an adverse outcome in any challenge to federal tax refunds previously received in the amounts of million and million as a result of the audit of our past tax returns currently being conducted by the irs  including as a result of the nopas we received from the irs on september  that propose to disallow the loss that generated the tax refunds that we previously received as well as require us to include income from the trust certificate from the march  sale date through june  in our taxable income for such years 
if the irs positions are successful  the disallowance of the loss  coupled with the additional taxable income after the sale date through june   would create federal tax adjustments that we estimate to be approximately million plus interest  with the interest continuing to accrue until the matter is resolved  regulatory requirements applicable to union federal  tms and fmd  including conditions and approvals relating to the union federal private student loan program  which limit union federal s ability to fund education loans  conditions in the education loan financing market  including the costs or availability of financing  rating agency assumptions or actions  and market receptivity to private education loan asset backed securitizations

results of operations fiscal years ended june   june  and june  the financial results of operations include fmd and its subsidiaries for the fiscal years then ended 
these results are reported through our continuing operations 
previously consolidated securitization trusts and the results of fmd s subsidiary first marblehead data services  inc  or fmds  are included in discontinued operations as discussed below for the fiscal years ended june  and june discontinued operations upon our adoption of asu and asu  effective july   we consolidated securitization trusts that we facilitated during fiscal through fiscal the education loans purchased by the trusts were initially subject to a default repayment guaranty by teri  while the education loans purchased by the nct trusts were  with limited exceptions  not teri guaranteed 
of the securitization trusts consolidated on july   were trusts and were nct trusts 
we refer to the consolidated trusts as the ncslt trusts and the consolidated nct trusts as the gate trusts 
consistent with our goal of refining our business model and focusing on our monogram platform and tuition billing and payment processing services  we disposed of certain components of our business in fiscal in particular  we sold our remaining variable interests in the trusts  we sold our trust administrator  fmds  and we resigned as the special servicer of the trusts  including the ncslt trusts 
in addition  the new third party owner of fmds terminated the agreement  effective september   with fmd s subsidiary fmer for the special servicing of the nct trusts  including the gate trusts 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that we no longer had any significant continuing involvement in the operations relating to the ncslt trusts and the gate trusts 
further  we concluded that this would occur within an appropriate assessment period for both the ncslt trusts and the gate trusts 
as a result  we reported the operations and activities relating to the ncslt trusts  the gate trusts and fmds within discontinued operations for fiscal and fiscal see note  discontinued operations  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for additional information

the aggregate of these benefits was million  or per common share 
the net loss from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended june  was million  or per common share  compared to a net loss from continuing operations of million  or per common share  for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in the net loss year over year was principally the result of a million improvement in the fair value changes of service revenue receivables and a larger income tax benefit of million 
net interest income after provision credit for loan losses for fiscal  net interest income after provision credit for loan losses increased by million to million from million in fiscal the increase resulted from an improved net interest margin due to 
table of contents an increase in net interest income from higher yielding investment securities and education loans held by union federal 
the provision for loan losses decreased by thousand  reflecting higher cash recoveries received during fiscal on previously defaulted education loans transferred by union federal to an indirect subsidiary of fmd in and a larger education loan portfolio on union federal s balance sheet 
for fiscal  net interest income after provision credit for loan losses increased by million to million from thousand in fiscal the increase resulted from an improved net interest margin due to the investment by union federal of cash into mortgage backed securities and  to a lesser extent  education loans 
the provision for loan losses improved by thousand  reflecting higher cash recoveries received during fiscal on previously defaulted education loans transferred by union federal to an indirect subsidiary of fmd in non interest revenues non interest revenues include tuition payment processing fees earned by tms  fee for service revenues for loan processing and origination and program support and fees related to our monogram platform  as well as fair value changes related to service revenue receivables 
as it relates to fiscal and fiscal  it also included fees for portfolio management performed on behalf of the securitization trusts that we previously facilitated 
non interest revenues were million for the fiscal year ended june   up million from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase from fiscal to fiscal was primarily related to million in higher fee income related to our monogram platform as a result of significantly higher partnered lending loan disbursements  the inclusion of million of revenues from cology llc for loan processing and increases in the valuation of our service revenue receivables of million  partially offset by million in lower revenues from special servicing and transition services related to the fmds sale 
non interest revenues were million for the fiscal year ended june   up million from thousand for the fiscal year ended june  the increase from fiscal to fiscal was principally due to the result of a non cash loss of million recorded during the third quarter of fiscal for changes to the recovery rate assumption used in determining the fair value of the service revenue receivables  discussed below  and an increase of million in tms tuition payment processing fees 
since we did not acquire tms until december   our fiscal results only included six months of results of tms versus a full year of revenue recorded in fiscal these increases were partially offset by lower administrative and other fees principally due to lower allowable revenues as a result of reductions in expense reimbursements by the ncslt trusts and the gate trusts under special servicing agreements for default prevention as well as lower education loan balances upon which the administrative fees were based 
fair value changes to service revenue receivables we record our service revenue receivables at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet 
at june   our service revenue receivables consisted of additional structural advisory fee and residual receivables and represent the estimated fair value of the service revenue receivables expected to be collected over the life of the various separate securitization trusts that have purchased education loans facilitated by us  with no further service obligations on our part 
prior to the sale of our variable interests in the trusts on november   we recorded asset servicing fee and additional structural advisory fee receivables in the ncslt trusts 
as compensation for our services related to asset servicing  we were entitled to a monthly asset servicing fee based on the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the education loans owned by the trusts 
changes in the estimated fair value of the service revenue receivables due  less any cash distributions received  are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations within the fair value changes to service revenue receivables 
in the absence of market based transactions  we use cash flow modeling techniques to derive an estimate of fair value for financial reporting purposes 
significant observable and unobservable inputs used to develop our fair value estimates include  but are not limited to  recovery  net default and prepayment rates  discount rates and the forward libor curve 
see note  fair value measurements  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for additional information 

table of contents the following table summarizes the details of the fair value changes to additional structural advisory fees  residual receivables and asset servicing fees fiscal years ended june  change between periods dollars in thousands additional structural advisory fees residuals asset servicing fees total fair value changes to service revenue receivables the increase in the fair value changes to service revenue receivables of million from fiscal to fiscal was largely due to the losses recorded in fiscal related to decreases in our net recovery rate assumptions for the ncslt trusts as compared to fiscal the increase in the fair value changes to service revenue receivables of million from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to fiscal events which included the sale of the additional structural advisory fee receivables related to the ncslt trusts and the related asset servicing agreement 
non interest expenses the following table reflects the composition of non interest expenses fiscal years ended june  change between periods dollars in thousands compensation and benefits general and administrative third party services depreciation and amortization marketing occupancy and equipment servicer fees merchant fees trust related special servicing expenses other total general and administrative total non interest expenses total number of employees at fiscal year end compensation and benefits compensation and benefits expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease of million year over year was primarily due to approximately thousand in lower severance related costs and thousand in lower non cash compensation partially offset by thousand in higher variable sales compensation 
total headcount decreased in fiscal due to the implementation of certain expense reduction efforts 
these decreases in headcount were largely offset by our hiring of employees from the cology sellers in connection with the acquisition of a substantial portion of the operating assets of the cology sellers as of october  compensation and benefits expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily the result of our acquisition of tms during mid year of fiscal general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease of million was largely driven by a decrease in 
table of contents trust related special servicing expenses  which declined million year over year  primarily as a result of the cessation of our special servicing obligations for the ncslt trusts 
additionally  marketing costs decreased by million year over year due to our investment in brand development of union federal s monogram based loan programs in fiscal general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase of million was a result of higher marketing expenses incurred in fiscal related to loan acquisition and the initial brand development of union federal s monogram based loan programs as well as higher merchant fees expenses related to payment processing services performed by tms as our fiscal results included only six months of results for tms 
these increases were partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization expenses for certain fixed assets that were fully depreciated and lower trust related special servicing costs for the ncslt trusts 
other income we recorded other income of thousand  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  due to resolution of certain matters related to the teri reorganization 
this income represented the forgiveness of notes payable and other liabilities  and cash distributions from the liquidating trust under teri s confirmed plan of reorganization 
during fiscal  we also recorded income related to the deconsolidation of the securitization trusts previously consolidated of million largely relating to the re establishment of the fair value of the residual interests that were previously eliminated upon the adoption of asu on july  during fiscal  we recorded other income of thousand related to the gain on the sale of a defaulted loan portfolio  which was transferred by union federal to an indirect subsidiary of fmd in fiscal years ended june  dollars in thousands gain from deconsolidation of trusts proceeds from teri settlement other total other income income taxes we are subject to federal income tax  as well as income tax in multiple us state and local jurisdictions 
our effective income tax rate is calculated on a consolidated basis 
the irs is auditing our tax returns for fiscal through fiscal we also remain subject to federal income tax examinations for fiscal through fiscal in addition  we are involved in several matters relating to the massachusetts tax treatment of gate  a former subsidiary of fmd 
see internal revenue service audit below as well as item  legal proceedings  and note  commitments and contingencies income tax matters  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for additional information regarding these matters 
our state income tax returns in jurisdictions other than massachusetts remain subject to examination for various fiscal years ended between june  and june  income tax expense from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended june  was million as compared to an income tax benefit of million in fiscal and income tax expense of thousand in fiscal the benefit in fiscal was primarily the result of the recognition of an income tax benefit of million during the second quarter of fiscal in connection with the atb order  as well as the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to gate s taxable year ended june  in addition  a million benefit was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal related to the gain on the sale of fmds  which was included in discontinued operations 

table of contents beginning in fiscal  we no longer had any taxable income in prior periods to offset current period net operating losses for federal income tax purposes 
as a result  we recorded a net operating loss carryforward asset as of june  and june   totaling million and million  respectively  for which we recorded a full valuation allowance 
under current law  we do not have remaining taxes paid within available net operating loss carryback periods  and it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized through future reversals of existing temporary differences or available tax planning strategies 
accordingly  we have determined that a valuation allowance was necessary for all of our deferred tax assets not scheduled to reverse against existing deferred tax liabilities as of june  and june  we will continue to review the recognition of deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
internal revenue service audit effective march   we completed the sale of the trust certificate 
in connection with the sale of the trust certificate  fmd entered into the asset services agreement pursuant to which fmd provided various consulting and advisory services to the purchaser of the trust certificate 
as a result of the sale of the trust certificate  as well as our operating losses incurred in fiscal  we recorded an income tax receivable for federal income taxes paid on taxable income in prior fiscal years 
in fiscal  we received a total of million in federal and state income tax refunds related to our income tax receivables 
furthermore  we received a federal income tax refund of million in october related to the operating losses in fiscal  which we applied to taxable income from fiscal in april  the irs commenced an audit of our tax returns for fiscal through fiscal  including a review of the tax treatment of the sale of the trust certificate 
such audits are consistent with the practice of the joint committee of taxation  which requires the irs to perform additional procedures  up to and including an audit of a taxpayer who receives a tax refund in excess of million 
the irs is also auditing our fiscal tax return in light of the million income tax refund that we received in october we cannot predict the timing or outcome of the irs audit 
we announced on august  that  as part of the audit process  we expected to receive a nopa from the irs 
on september  we received two nopas from the irs that contain the proposed adjustments that we announced on august  in the nopas  the irs asserts that our sale of the trust certificate should not be recognized for federal income tax purposes primarily because we retained the economic benefits and burdens of the trust certificate  including  among other things  retaining certain repurchase rights and data rights 
the irs further concludes that the transaction should be characterized as a financing instead of a sale and asserts that the sale of the trust certificate and the execution of the asset services agreement had the impact of converting taxable income to the owner from an accrual basis to a cash basis 
as a result  the nopas propose to disallow the loss that generated the tax refunds that we previously received as well as require us to include income from the trust certificate from the march  sale date through june  in our taxable income for such years 
if the irs positions are successful  the disallowance of the loss  coupled with the additional taxable income after the sale date through june   would create federal income tax adjustments that we estimate to be approximately million plus interest  with the interest continuing to accrue until the matter is resolved 
the nopas do not address tax years beyond june  the nopas are proposed recommendations of the reviewing agent in the irs field office and  as such  are initial irs positions and not final determinations  and  as a result  do not require any tax payment at the time of issuance 
we have considered the requirements of asc  the impact of the nopas  along with other information supporting our overall tax position  in our assessment of the ultimate outcome of this matter with the irs  and based on our analysis  we did not record an accrual related to this matter in our consolidated financial statements at june  or when we received the nopas 
such an accrual  if it becomes necessary  could be significant and material to our consolidated financial statements 
we plan to vigorously contest the proposed adjustments  and we believe we have a strong position as it relates to this matter 
the process of resolving this issue  which may include an appeals process with the irs and litigation 
table of contents in the us tax court and the us court of appeals  may extend over multiple years depending on how it progresses through the irs and  if necessary  the courts 
assuming this matter advances unresolved through the irs administrative process and the courts  we are not required to make tax payments  if any  until the matter is fully resolved  which may be several years from now 
however  if we receive an unfavorable outcome from the us tax court and appeal  we must post a bond in order to prevent collection of the tax deficiency 
financial condition total assets increased million to million at june  from million at june  total stockholders equity decreased million to million at june  from million at june  the changes in our financial position from june  to june  are discussed in detail below 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments we had combined cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million and million at june  and june   respectively 
of this total  at june   fmd and its non bank subsidiaries held million in interest bearing and non interest bearing deposits  money market funds and certificates of deposit with highly rated financial institutions 
union federal held a total of million in interest bearing and non interest bearing deposits and money market funds at june  union federal is subject to restrictions on the payment of dividends without prior approval from the occ 
the decrease of million was a result of million related to net investments in available for sale securities  education loans and mortgage loans at union federal  million to fund operations  million in additional deposits for participation accounts and million related to cash paid for a substantial portion of the operating assets of the cology sellers 
these uses were partially offset by net growth in deposits at union federal of million 
restricted cash at june   restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets was million  of which million was held by tms 
restricted cash at june  was million  of which million was held by tms  including million held at union federal  which was eliminated for purposes of our consolidated balance sheet presentation  and million was held by fmd and its other non bank subsidiaries 
the increase of million from fiscal to fiscal in restricted cash was primarily due to the return of the deposit held at union federal back to tms in fiscal  partially offset by lower outstanding balances 
restricted cash held by tms represents tuition payments collected from students or their families on behalf of educational institutions 
these cash balances are held in escrow under a trust agreement for the benefit of 
table of contents tms educational institution clients and are generally subject to cyclicality  tending to peak in august of each school year  early in the enrollment cycle  and to decrease in may  at the end of the school year 
during fiscal  tms restricted cash balances ranged from a high of million during august to a low of million during may at times  tms may deposit a portion of restricted cash in a deposit account at union federal 
such deposit is governed by a trust agreement between tms and a third party trustee 
subject to the capital requirements and other laws  regulations  and restrictions applicable to union federal  the cash that is deposited with union federal in connection with the tuition payment plans is not restricted and  accordingly  is not included in restricted cash in our consolidated financial statements 
in december  we transferred million of tms deposits to union federal and  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  this deposit was transferred  in full  back to tms 
restricted cash held by cology llc represents loan origination proceeds and loan payments which it collects and disburses on behalf of its lender clients 
restricted cash held by our other subsidiaries relates to recoveries on defaulted education loans collected on behalf of clients as well as undistributed loan origination proceeds 
we record a liability on our consolidated balance sheets representing tuition payments due to our tms clients  loan origination proceeds and loan payments due to our cology llc clients and recoveries on defaulted education loans and education loan proceeds due to schools 
investments available for sale investments classified as available for sale are reported at fair value at our consolidated balance sheet date 
our investment portfolio provides a source of short term liquidity 
investments available for sale principally consisted of mortgage backed federal agency securities held by union federal at both june  and june  the investments available for sale increased by million from million at june  to million at june  primarily as a result of union federal s purchase of million in mortgage backed securities  partially offset by million in principal repayments during fiscal the portfolio generated net unrealized losses of thousand at june  and net unrealized gains of thousand at june   which was recognized in other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
see note  investments available for sale  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for additional information loans at june  and june   we classified all education loans and substantially all mortgage loans as held to maturity

we may also apply qualitative adjustments in determining the allowance for loan losses 
our default experience with this loan portfolio is limited by the seasoning of the portfolio  however  we have utilized our historical database and experience in projecting the level of defaults and recoveries of the monogram based loan portfolio relying in part on historical results from our securitization trusts that we previously facilitated for loans that have similar credit characteristics to those in our monogram based loan portfolio 
at june  and  there were thousand and thousand  respectively  of educations loans that were in non accrual status and no education loans that had specific reserves 
these loans included thousand and thousand  at june  and june   respectively  of loans that were transferred by union federal to an indirect subsidiary of fmd in  prior to the launch of our monogram platform 
for loans greater than days past due  but not yet charged off  our policy is to evaluate the loans under asc  receivables  for a specific reserve 
at june   there were thousand of education loans that were greater than days past due  which included thousand of monogram based education loans issued through union federal 
loans which were transferred by union federal to an indirect subsidiary of fmd in  prior to the launch of our monogram platform  were fully reserved for at june  and overall education loan credit quality management monitors the credit quality of an education loan based on loan status  as outlined below 
the impact of changes in loan status  such as delinquency and time in repayment  is incorporated into the quarterly allowance for loan loss calculation through our projection of defaults 
the following table represents our loan origination metrics with respect to our monogram based programs held at union federal at june  and june  june  weighted average fico score co signers delinquent loans the weighted average fico score is based on the maximum score of the borrower or co signer at origination 

table of contents the following table provides additional information on the status of education loans outstanding june  as a percentage of total june  as a percentage of total dollars in thousands principal of loans outstanding in basic forbearance in school and in deferment in repayment  including alternative payment plans  classified as current days past due delinquent days past due  but days past due delinquent days past due  but days past due in default days past due  but not yet charged off total gross loan principal outstanding non accrual loan principal days past due past due loan principal days  but days past due still accruing interest in alternative payment plans we use the following terms to describe borrowers payment status in school and in deferment pursuant to the terms of the education loans  a borrower may choose to defer principal and interest payments while carrying a specified academic course load and may be eligible to defer payments for an additional six months after graduation during a grace period 
at the end of the deferment period  any remaining accrued but unpaid interest is capitalized and added to principal outstanding 
in repayment we determine the repayment status of a borrower  including a borrower making payments pursuant to alternative payment plans  by contractual due dates 
a borrower making reduced payments for a limited period of time pursuant to an alternative payment plan will be considered current if such reduced payments are timely made 
under our monogram platform  borrowers may be in repayment while in school 
payment options while in school include full principal and interest  partial interest and interest only 
forbearance pursuant to the terms of the education loans  a borrower may apply for forbearance  which is a temporary reprieve from making full contractual payments 
forbearance can take many forms  at the option of the creditor 
the most common forms of forbearance include the following basic forbearance cessation of all contractual payments for a maximum allowable forbearance period of one year  granted in three month increments 
although basic forbearance is available as part of our monogram based programs  it has not been substantially utilized due to the seasoning of our monogram based education loan portfolio 
alternative payment plans pursuant to an alternative payment plan  a borrower can make a reduced payment for a limited period of time 
the amount of the payment varies depending on the program and may be set at a fixed dollar amount  a percentage of contractual required payments or interest only payments 
generally  approval for alternative payment plans is granted for a maximum of six to months  depending on the program 
the use of forbearance is contemplated at the origination of an education loan and  as noted in the credit agreement with the borrower  is granted at the lender s discretion 
under both basic forbearance and alternative payment plans  the education loan continues to accrue interest 
when forbearance ceases  unpaid interest is capitalized and added to principal outstanding  and the borrower s required payments are recalculated at a higher amount to pay off the loan  plus the additional accrued and capitalized interest  at the original stated interest rate by the original maturity date 
there is no forgiveness of principal or interest  reduction in the interest rate or extension of the maturity date 

table of contents forbearance programs result in a delay in the timing of payments received from borrowers  however  assuming the collection of the forborne amounts  provide for an increase in the gross volume of cash receipts over the term of the education loan due to the additional accrued interest capitalized while in forbearance 
forbearance programs may have the effect of delaying default emergence  and alternative payment plans may reduce the utilization of basic forbearance 
mortgage loans held to maturity through our bank subsidiary  union federal  we carry a portfolio of mortgage loans held to maturity 
we establish a general allowance for loan losses for mortgage loans that have similar risk profiles 
the allowance allocation factor for the general reserve is based on the historical net charge off rate  which is then adjusted for current qualitative or environmental factors that are likely to cause estimated credit losses associated with the existing portfolio to differ from historical loss experience 
management considers the risk factors and assesses the impact of current issues and changes in those factors to the portfolio on an ongoing basis 
in addition  we establish a specific allowance for loan losses when a loan is deemed to be impaired 
management estimates the credit loss by comparing the loan s carrying value against either the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price or the expected realizable fair value of the collateral  in the case of collateral dependent loans 
a specific allowance is assigned to the impaired loan for the amount of estimated credit loss 
impaired loans are charged off  in whole or in part  when management believes that the recorded investment in the loan is uncollectible 
the following table summarizes the activity in the allowance for loan losses for mortgage loans fiscal years ended june  dollars in thousands balance  beginning of year provision credit for loan losses charge offs recoveries from borrowers balance  end of year we place mortgage loans on non accrual status when they become days past due as to either principal or interest 
the following table summarizes the aging of past due mortgage loans june  dollars in thousands non accrual loans residential family commercial mixed use accruing loans accruing loans days past due we did not have any accruing mortgage loans that were or more days past due 
deposits for participation interest accounts deposits for participation accounts were reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets 
deposits for participation accounts increased by million from million at june  to million at june  the increase year over year is primarily attributable to increased fundings in fiscal due to an increase in disbursed loan volumes for our partnered lending clients 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired 
other intangible assets represent purchased assets that can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual rights or because the asset can be exchanged on its own or in combination with a related contract  asset or liability 
in connection with our acquisition of assets from tms and the cology sellers  we recorded other intangible assets related to the tms customer list and tradename and the cology sellers customer list  each of which we amortize on a straight line basis over years  and tms technology  which we amortize on a straight line basis over six years 
we record amortization expense in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
as it relates to tms  the customer list intangible asset is related to educational institutions with which tms had existing tuition programs in place as of december  the trade name intangible asset relates to the name and reputation of tms in the tuition payment industry 
intangible assets attributable to technology represented the replacement cost of software and systems acquired that are necessary to support operations  net of an obsolescence factor 
goodwill represents the value ascribed to the acquisition of tms that cannot be separately ascribed to a tangible or intangible asset 
as it relates to cology llc  the customer list intangible asset is related to lender clients  including credit unions  banks and schools  with which the cology sellers had existing loan origination and servicing programs in place as of october  goodwill represents the value ascribed to the acquisition of a substantial portion of the operating assets of the cology sellers that cannot be separately ascribed to a tangible or intangible asset 
in  we evaluated our goodwill for impairment on may  which is our annual impairment testing date  and concluded that the fair market values of the tms and cology llc reporting units were approximately and  respectively  in excess of our recorded book value and  therefore  were not impaired as of that date 
in determining whether impairment exists  we assess impairment at the level of the tms and cology llc reporting units 
there have been no indicators of impairment since that date 
various assumptions go into our assessment of whether there is any goodwill impairment to be recorded 
the more meaningful assumptions that contribute to the cash flow model used to determine the fair value of the tms reporting unit include the net retention rate of new and existing clients  the penetration rate achieved in the overall customer portfolio  adoption of refund management and student account center products and pricing  the level of interest income to be earned by tms on funds received but not yet disbursed to client schools  including the forward libor curve  the level of cash balances and the applicable hold periods  all of which impact net interest income  expense levels at tms and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flow streams 
tms business would be adversely affected if any of the following were to occur higher attrition rates than planned as a result of the competitive environment or our inability to provide products and services that are competitive in the marketplace  lower than planned adoption rates of refund management and student account center products  higher than expected expense levels to provide services to tms clients  a lower interest rate environment than depicted by the libor curve  shorter hold periods or lower cash balances than contemplated  which would reduce our overall net interest income opportunity for cash that is held by us on behalf of tms school clients  increases in equity returns required by investors and changes in our business model that may impact one or more of these variables 
the more meaningful assumptions that contribute to the cash flow model used to determine the fair value of the cology llc reporting unit include loan volume growth  revenues related to the cross selling of monogram based products and services  client attrition  costs required to support the assumed volume of the business  and discount rates 
cology llc s business would be adversely affected if any of the following were to occur higher attrition rates than planned  a lack of acceptance of monogram products and services by its credit union and other lender clients  higher than expected expense levels to provide services to cology llc clients and changes in our business model that may impact one or more of these variables 
at june   our net intangible assets balance was million  of which million related to tms and million related to cology llc 
during the fiscal year ended june   we recorded amortization expense of million related to tms and thousand related to cology llc 

table of contents contractual obligations our consolidated contractual obligations consist of commitments under operating leases 
the following table below summarizes our contractual cash obligations by period at june   excluding the offsetting effect of payments due to us under subleases contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years more than years dollars in thousands operating lease obligations for additional information on our operating leases  see item  properties  in this annual report

on june   we entered into a sublease agreement  effective july   reducing our rented space at our corporate headquarters in boston  massachusetts boylston street by  square feet 
we expect to collect thousand in sublease revenue over the remaining term of this sublease 
in addition  effective july   we entered into an amendment to reduce our rented space in our medford  massachusetts location by  square feet  which results in a savings of thousand over the remaining term of the lease 
total stockholders equity total stockholders equity decreased from million at june  to million at june  as a result of our net loss of million and the change in accumulated other comprehensive income of million for the net unrealized losses on our investments available for sale portfolio  partially offset by an increase of million in additional paid in capital primarily for stock compensation 
off balance sheet arrangements we offer outsourcing services in connection with education loan programs  from program design through securitization of the education loans 
we have historically structured and facilitated the securitization of education loans for our clients through a series of special purpose trusts 
the principal uses of the securitization trusts we facilitated have been to generate sources of liquidity for our clients and union federal s assets sold into such trusts and make available more funds to students and colleges 
see critical accounting policies and estimates consolidation below for a discussion of our determination to not consolidate these securitization trusts

we also use a non gaap financial metric  net operating cash usage  when evaluating our cash and liquidity position  discussed in detail under non gaap measure net operating cash usage below 
net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations for fiscal was million  compared with net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations of million for fiscal the increase in cash used was principally the result of an increase in net funding of participation accounts of million for fiscal coupled with the receipt of million from the sale of certain service revenue receivables in the second quarter of fiscal these changes were partially offset by a million lower loss from operations in fiscal compared to fiscal we anticipate continuing to receive fees related to loan processing and origination and portfolio management services as well as fees related to monogram based loan programs 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and investments  coupled with the management of our expenses and these fees  will be adequate to fund our operating losses in the short term as we seek to expand our client and revenue base over the short and long term 
we are uncertain  however  as to whether we will be successful in selling our monogram platform to additional lenders or how much loan volume may be originated by current or any additional lenders in the future 
net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal the improvement of million was the result of an increase in the net proceeds from short term investments of million and a million decline in the net purchases of available for sale securities as this portfolio was significantly expanded in fiscal as part of the asset diversification process at union federal 
these were partially offset by an million decrease in restricted cash and restricted funds due to clients  due to the million of tms deposits that was transferred to union federal in fiscal and returned to tms in fiscal  and million used for the acquisition of a substantial portion of the operating assets of the cology sellers 
net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was million for fiscal compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million during fiscal  primarily reflecting an increase in deposits 

table of contents the occ regulates all capital distributions by union federal directly or indirectly to us  including dividend payments 
union federal is required to file a notice with the occ at least days before the proposed declaration of a dividend or approval of a proposed capital distribution by union federal s board of directors 
union federal must file an application to receive the approval of the occ for a proposed capital distribution when  among other circumstances  the total amount of all capital distributions including the proposed capital distribution for the applicable calendar year exceeds net income for that year to date plus the retained net income for the preceding two years 
a notice or application to make a capital distribution by union federal may be disapproved or denied by the occ if it determines that  after making the capital distribution  union federal would fail to meet minimum required capital levels or if the capital distribution raises safety or soundness concerns or is otherwise restricted by statute  regulation or agreement between union federal and the occ or a condition imposed by an occ agreement 
under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act  or fdicia  an fdic insured depository institution such as union federal is prohibited from making capital distributions  including the payment of dividends  if  after making such distribution  the institution would become undercapitalized as such term is used in the fdicia 
sources and uses of liquidity we expect to fund our short term liquidity requirements primarily through cash and cash equivalents and revenues from operations  and we expect to fund our long term liquidity requirements through a combination of revenues from operations and various financing vehicles available to us in the abs markets 
we may also utilize issuances of common stock  promissory notes or other securities or the potential sale of certain assets of fmd 
we expect to assess our financing alternatives periodically and access the capital markets opportunistically 
if our existing resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  or if we were to enter into a strategic arrangement with another company  we may need to sell additional equity or debt securities 
any sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders  and we cannot be certain that additional public or private financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to further delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more aspects of our operational activities  which could harm our business 
our liquidity and capital funding requirements may depend on a number of factors  including cash necessary to fund our operations  including the operations of union federal  tms and cology llc  and capital expenditures  the extent to which our services and products  including our monogram platform  tms offerings and cology llc offerings  gain market share and remain competitive at pricing levels favorable to us  the results of the audit conducted by the irs of our tax returns for fiscal through fiscal  which could result in challenges to tax refunds previously received in the amounts of million in connection with our sale of the trust certificate and the million income tax refund received in october in connection with the irs audit  on september   we received two nopas from the irs that contain the proposed adjustments that we announced on august  the nopas propose to disallow the loss that generated the tax refunds that we previously received as well as require us to include income from the trust certificate from the march  sale date through june  in our taxable income for such years 
if the irs positions are successful  the disallowance of the loss  coupled with the additional taxable income after the sale date through june   would create federal income tax adjustments that we estimate to be approximately million plus interest  with the interest continuing to accrue until the matter is resolved  the profitability of our monogram platform  which is dependent on  among other things  the amount of loan volume our lender clients are able to generate and costs incurred to acquire such volume  the extent to which we fund credit enhancement arrangements or contribute to credit facility providers in connection with our monogram platform  the ability to access wholesale financing opportunities within union federal to help meet the liquidity needs generated by monogram based loans  
table of contents the regulatory capital requirements applicable to union federal see support of subsidiary bank below for additional information as well as any capital contributions or credit enhancements fmd may make to union federal  the resolution of our appeal of the atb order  which could also affect our state tax liabilities for fiscal and fiscal  and the timing  size  structure and terms of any securitization or other funding transactions that we structure  as well as the composition of the loan pool being securitized 
liquidity is required for capital expenditures  working capital  business development expenses  business acquisitions  income tax payments  costs associated with alternative financing transactions  general corporate expenses  capital provided in connection with monogram based loan program credit enhancement arrangements or capital market transactions and maintaining the regulatory capital of union federal 
in order to preserve capital and maximize liquidity in challenging market conditions  we have in the past taken certain broad measures to reduce the risk related to education loans and residual receivables on our consolidated balance sheet  change our fee structure  add new products and reduce our overhead expenses 
in addition  the fmd board of directors has eliminated regular quarterly cash dividends for the foreseeable future 
deposits union federal has liabilities for retail time  money market and savings deposits accounts 
the following table summarizes union federal s time deposits greater than thousand by maturity at june  dollars in thousands within three months three to six months six months to twelve months greater than twelve months total time deposits thousand the maturities of these deposits are not directly indicative of the future timing of cash needed for financing activities because they do not take into account the customers that may reinvest their funds into new time deposits or into other types of deposit accounts 
restricted funds due to clients as part of our operations  we have cash that is recorded as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets because it is deposited with third party institutions and not available for our use 
included in restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets are tuition payments due to schools  undisbursed loan origination proceeds and loan payments and recoveries on defaulted education loans 
we record a liability on our consolidated balance sheets representing tuition payments due to our tms clients  loan origination proceeds and loan payments due to our cology llc clients and recoveries on defaulted education loans and education loan proceeds due to schools 
lines of credit at june   through union federal  we had million available for borrowing under an unused line of credit with the federal home loan bank of boston 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit at june  or june  non gaap measure net operating cash usage in addition to providing financial measurements based on gaap  we present below an additional financial metric that we refer to as net operating cash usage that was not prepared in accordance with gaap 
we define net operating cash usage to approximate cash requirements to fund our operations 
net operating cash usage 
table of contents is not directly comparable to our consolidated statements of cash flows prepared in accordance with gaap 
legislative and regulatory guidance discourage the use of  and emphasis on  non gaap financial metrics and require companies to explain why a non gaap financial metric is relevant to management and investors 
management and the fmd board of directors use this non gaap financial metric  in addition to gaap financial measures  as a basis for measuring and forecasting our core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods 
this non gaap financial measure is also used by us in our financial and operational decision making 
we believe that the inclusion of this non gaap financial metric helps investors to gain a better understanding of our results  including our non interest expenses and liquidity position 
in addition  our presentation of this non gaap financial measure is consistent with how we expect that analysts may calculate their estimates of our financial results in their research reports and with how clients  investors  analysts and financial news media may evaluate our financial results 
there are limitations associated with reliance on any non gaap financial measure because any such measure is specific to our operations and financial performance  which makes comparisons with other companies financial results more challenging 
nevertheless  by providing both gaap and non gaap financial measures  we believe that investors are able to compare our gaap results to those of other companies  while also gaining a better understanding of our operating performance  consistent with management s evaluation 
net operating cash usage should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for  or superior to  financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 
net operating cash usage excludes the effects of income taxes  acquisitions or divestitures  participation account net fundings and changes in other assets and other liabilities that are solely related to short term timing of cash payments or receipts 
in accordance with the requirements of regulation g promulgated by the sec  the table below presents the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  loss from continuing operations  before income taxes  for the twelve months ended june  and june   and reconciles the gaap measure to the comparable non gaap financial metric twelve months ended june  dollars in thousands loss from continuing operations  before income taxes adjustments to loss from continuing operations  before income taxes non cash gain from deconsolidation of trusts fair value changes to service revenue receivables cash distributions from service revenue receivables depreciation and amortization stock based compensation tms deferred revenue additions to property and equipment other  net of cash flows from fmds in fiscal non gaap net operating cash usage net operating cash usage for the fiscal year ended june  was million  a million  or  reduction compared to the fiscal year ended june  the decrease of million for fiscal as compared to fiscal was largely the result of a decrease in non interest cash expenses of million driven principally by decreases of million in general and administrative expenses and million in compensation and benefits expenses 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses was largely due to a decrease of million in trust related special servicing expenses as a result of the cessation of our special servicing obligations for the ncslt trusts 
increased cash receipts from service revenue receivables of million also contributed to the decrease in net operating cash usage 
the decrease in net operating cash usage was partially offset by approximately million of cash flows related to fmds in fiscal not received in fiscal 
table of contents support of subsidiary bank union federal is a federally chartered thrift that is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on our liquidity 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  union federal must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of union federal s assets and liabilities as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital amounts and classifications  however  are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
union federal s equity capital was million at june   up from million at june   principally due to million in capital contributions to union federal by fmd during fiscal quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require union federal to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total capital and tier capital to risk weighted assets each as defined in the regulations 
as of june  and june   union federal was well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
union federal s regulatory capital ratios were as follows as of the dates below regulatory guidelines june  minimum well capitalized capital ratios tier risk based capital total risk based capital tier core capital fmd is subject to regulation  supervision and examination by the federal reserve  as a savings and loan holding company  and union federal is subject to regulation  supervision and examination by the occ 
in march  the fmd board of directors adopted resolutions required by the ots  union federal s regulator at that time  undertaking to support the implementation by union federal of its business plan  so long as union federal is owned or controlled by fmd  and to notify the ots and now the occ effective in fiscal in advance of any distributions to our stockholders in excess of million per fiscal quarter and any incurrence or guarantee of debt in excess of million 
these resolutions continue to be applied by the federal reserve 
distribution to our stockholders may be further restricted by the federal reserve s required approval in those instances when such distributions exceed the net earnings of the prior month period 
inflation inflation was not a material factor in either revenues or operating expenses during the periods presented 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the date of our consolidated financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates  assumptions and judgments on our historical experience  economic conditions and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 

table of contents on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  particularly as they relate to accounting policies that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
we regard an accounting estimate or assumption underlying our consolidated financial statements to be a critical accounting estimate where the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on our financial condition or operating performance is material 
we have discussed our accounting policies with the audit committee of the fmd board of directors 
we consider the following to be our critical accounting policies whether to consolidate the financial results of a vie  the determination of goodwill and other intangible asset impairment  and income taxes relating to uncertain tax positions under asc consolidation we review certain vies for which we have previously securitized to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the entity 
we continually reassess our involvement with each vie in which we have an interest  both on and off balance sheet  and our determination of whether consolidation or deconsolidation of a vie is appropriate 
we monitor matters related to our ability to control economic performance  such as contractual changes in the services we provide  the extent of our ownership and the rights of third parties to terminate us as a service provider 
in addition  we monitor the financial performance of each vie for indications that we may or may not have the right to absorb benefits or the obligation to absorb losses associated with variability in the financial performance of the vie that could potentially be significant to that vie 
if  for any reason  we determine that we can no longer be considered the primary beneficiary  we would be required to deconsolidate the vie 
deconsolidation of a vie is accounted for in the same manner as the sale of a subsidiary  with a gain or loss recorded in our consolidated statements of operations to the extent that proceeds  if any  are more or less than the net assets of the vie 
effective july   the financial accounting standards board amended asc  consolidation  or asc  and removed the exemption from consolidation for a qualifying special purpose entity 
asc further requires enterprises to perform analyses to determine if they are the primary beneficiary of a vie 
a primary beneficiary of a vie is an enterprise that has both the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact that vie s economic performance  and the obligation to absorb losses of the vie that could potentially be significant to that vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to that vie 
as a result  on july   we consolidated securitization trusts that were facilitated by us because we determined that our services related to default prevention and collections management  for which we can only be removed for cause  combined with the variability that we absorbed as part of our securitization fee structure  made us the primary beneficiary of those trusts 
in addition  we deconsolidated our indirect subsidiary ufsb spv because we determined that we did not have the power to direct activities that most significantly impact ufsb spv s economic performance 
during fiscal  we deconsolidated the securitization trusts we had consolidated as we no longer were the primary beneficiary of these trusts 
see note  discontinued operations  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for additional information we also monitor our involvement with nine off balance sheet vies for which we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary due to the sole  unilateral rights of other parties to terminate us in our role as 
table of contents service provider or due to a lack of obligation on our part to absorb benefits or losses of the vie that would be significant to that vie 
a significant change to the pertinent rights of other parties or us  or a significant change to the ranges of possible financial performance outcomes used in our assessment of the variability of cash flows due to us  could cause us to change our determination of whether or not a vie should be consolidated in future periods 
our determination to consolidate or deconsolidate a vie may lead to increased volatility in our financial results and make comparisons of results between time periods challenging 
review of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on december   we completed our acquisition of the assets  liabilities and operations of tms  formerly a division of keybank national association 
on october   cology llc acquired a substantial portion of the operating assets  and assumed certain liabilities  of the cology sellers 
as a result of these acquisitions  we recorded goodwill and intangible assets 
we test goodwill for impairment annually and more frequently if circumstances warrant 
intangible assets acquired consist of the tms customer lists  technology and tradename and the cology sellers customer list 
the values of these intangible assets were estimated using valuation techniques  based on discounted cash flow analysis 
these intangible assets are being amortized over the period the assets are expected to contribute to our cash flows 
these intangible assets are subject to impairment tests in accordance with gaap  generally  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be fully recoverable 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair values of the operations of the tms and cology llc reporting units to their carrying values  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value  goodwill is not deemed to be impaired 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  a further analysis is required to determine the amount of impairment  if any 
there are significant judgments involved in determining the fair values of the tms and cology llc reporting units  including assumptions regarding the estimates of future cash flows from existing and new business activities  customer relationships  the value of existing customer contracts  the value of other intangible assets  as well as assumptions regarding what we believe a third party is willing to pay for all of the assets and liabilities of tms and cology llc 
the calculation also requires us to estimate the appropriate discount and growth rates to apply to those projected cash flows and an appropriate control premium to apply to arrive at a final fair value 
since the businesses are not publicly traded  and often there is not comparable market data available  there is a higher degree of judgment applied and the use of cash flows is weighted more heavily than the use of market multiples 
in the event that we determine that our goodwill or intangible assets are impaired  the recognition of an impairment charge could have an adverse impact on our results of operations in the period that the impairment occurred or on our financial position 
for fiscal and fiscal  we recorded no goodwill impairment 
we evaluated goodwill for impairment at our annual impairment testing date of may income taxes certain areas of accounting for income taxes require management s judgment  including determining the adequacy of liabilities for uncertain tax positions 
judgments are made regarding various tax positions  which are often subjective and involve assumptions about items that are inherently uncertain 
if actual factors and conditions differ materially from estimates made by management  the actual realization of liabilities for uncertain tax positions could vary materially from the amounts previously recorded 
deferred tax assets arise from items that may be used as a tax deduction or credit in future income tax returns  for which a financial statement tax benefit has already been recognized 
the realization of the net deferred tax asset generally depends upon future levels of taxable income and the existence of prior years taxable income to which refund claims could be carried back 
valuation allowances are recorded against those deferred tax assets determined not likely to be realized 
deferred tax liabilities represent items that will require a future tax payment 
they generally represent tax expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred  or a deduction taken on our tax return but not yet recognized as an expense in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk is the primary market risk associated with our operations 
management monitors liquidity and interest rate risk matters 
these matters are discussed with the fmd board of directors and the union federal board of directors  as applicable 
interest rate risk is the risk of loss to future earnings due to changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk applies to all of our interest bearing assets and liabilities  as well as service revenue receivables 
our risk based interest bearing assets are largely made up of our investments available for sale  education loans and mortgage loans 
the mix of fixed rate versus variable rate instruments for our investments available for sale and loan portfolios as of june  are presented in the table below june  amount variable variable fixed fixed dollars in thousands investments available for sale education loans held to maturity mortgage loans held to maturity as shown above  at june   our education loan portfolio consisted entirely of variable rate loans that generally reprice in accordance with libor 
additionally  approximately of our investments available for sale and approximately of our mortgage loan portfolio were also variable rate instruments 
as market rates increase or decrease  our variable rate interest bearing assets are likely to be immediately impacted while our interest bearing liabilities would be slower to reprice 
the balance of the interest bearing assets in the table above were fixed rate instruments 
of these fixed rate instruments  approximately were available for sale securities  which had a weighted average life of years 
in addition to the interest bearing assets in the table above  our interest bearing assets included short term investments of million at june   which consisted of fixed rate certificates of deposit that have maturities of less than one year 
our interest bearing liabilities consisted of customer deposits held at union federal  totaling million at june  of these deposits  approximately were comprised of demand deposits  including savings deposits and money market deposits  which are generally subject to daily re pricing 
the remaining approximately of customer deposits represented fixed rate time deposits  of which approximately had maturities in excess of months from june  deposit pricing is subject to regular examination by a committee of senior managers from union federal and fmd s finance and governance  risk and compliance departments 
the committee considers competitors pricing  inflows and outflows of deposit balances and union federal s funding requirements to make pricing decisions in order to attain the desired volume of deposits in each given duration and product type 
our investment decisions with respect to the interest rate characteristics of our interest bearing assets are driven by the nature  volume and duration of our interest bearing liabilities 
generally  our interest bearing liabilities are either variable rate instruments or are of a short duration  as discussed above 
accordingly  we generally seek to invest in interest bearing assets that are subject to frequent repricing or are of limited duration 
as noted above  approximately of union federal s mortgage loans  approximately of its available for sale securities and all of its education loans had variable interest rates at june  although these variable interest rate assets generally reprice more frequently and have longer duration than our deposits  interest rate risk with respect to net interest revenues is mitigated by similarities in the interest rate and market risks underlying loan and deposit pricing 
we invest our excess cash primarily in money market funds  federal funds sold  time deposits with original maturities of less than one year and us federal agency mortgage backed securities 
management regularly reviews a wide variety of interest rate shift scenario results to evaluate interest rate risk exposure  including scenarios showing the effect of steepening or flattening changes in the yield curve 
the changes contemplated in these interest rate scenarios would result in immaterial changes to our overall results  largely as a result of a high percentage of assets that possess variable interest rates 
further  increases in interest 
table of contents rates may have an adverse impact on our consolidated balance sheets as the fixed rate portion of our investments available for sale portfolio could continue to experience unrealized losses 
interest rate risk is mitigated with respect to our investments available for sale portfolio due to the largely variable rate nature of our interest bearing assets and liabilities 
we use current market interest rates and our expectations of future interest rates to estimate fair value of service revenue receivables 
we believe that this approach adequately reflects the interest rate risk inherent in those estimates
