table of contents first acceptance corporation k insurance companies present a combined ratio as a measure of their overall underwriting profitability 
the components of the combined ratio are as follows 
loss ratio loss ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to premiums earned and is a basic element of underwriting profitability 
we calculate this ratio based on all direct and assumed premiums earned  net of ceded reinsurance 
expense ratio expense ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of insurance operating expenses to net premiums earned 
insurance operating expenses are reduced by commission and fee income from insureds 
this is a measurement that illustrates relative management efficiency in administering our operations 
combined ratio combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio 
if the combined ratio is at or above  an insurance company cannot be profitable without sufficient investment income 
the following table presents the loss  expense and combined ratios for our insurance operations

operational initiatives during the past year  we renewed our focus on improving the customer experience and value through several initiatives 
through february  our progress has included investment in our sales organization to improve the quality and consistency of the customer experience in our retail stores  continued development of our brand  investment in rebranding our store fronts and refurbishing our store interiors  development of electronic signature capabilities  thereby enabling most customers to receive quotes and bind policies over the phone and through our website  development of a consumer based website that reflects our branding strategy  improves the customer experience  and allows for full service capabilities including quoting  binding and receiving payments  implementation of trial sales of third party carrier automobile insurance in select locations where pricing is highly competitive  and development of an internet specific sales strategy to drive quote traffic to our website 
moving forward  we continue to believe that our retail stores are the foundation of our business  providing an opportunity for us to directly interact with our customers on a regular basis 
we also recognize that customer preferences have changed and that we need to adapt to meet those needs 
for that reason  we will continue to invest in our people  retail stores  website and call center initiatives  and our customer interaction efforts in order to improve the customer experience 
our current initiatives include expansion of our potential customer base through enhancements to our insurance products and expansion of ancillary product offerings  including life insurance  continued investment and refinement of our internet specific sales strategy  continued investment and development of our website s full service capabilities  continued trial sales of third party carrier auto insurance in select locations where pricing is highly competitive  and investment in our call center processes and people in order to better support our phone and website sales efforts 

table of contents first acceptance corporation k investments we use the services of an independent investment manager to manage our investment portfolio 
the investment manager conducts  in accordance with our investment policy  all of the investment purchases and sales for our insurance company subsidiaries 
our investment policy has been established by the investment committee of our board of directors and specifically addresses overall investment goals and objectives  authorized investments  prohibited securities  restrictions on sales by the investment manager and guidelines as to asset allocation  duration and credit quality 
management and the investment committee meet regularly with our investment manager to review the performance of the portfolio and compliance with our investment guidelines 
the invested assets of the insurance company subsidiaries consist substantially of marketable  investment grade debt securities  and include us government securities  municipal bonds  corporate bonds and collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
investment income is comprised primarily of interest earned on these securities  net of related investment expenses 
realized gains and losses may occur from time to time as changes are made to our holdings based upon changes in interest rates or the credit quality of specific securities 
the value of our consolidated investment portfolio was million at december  and consisted of fixed maturity securities and an investment in a mutual fund  all carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
at december   we had gross unrealized gains of million and gross unrealized losses of million in our consolidated investment portfolio 
at december   of the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio was rated investment grade a credit rating of aaa to bbb by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations 
the average credit rating of our fixed maturity portfolio was aa at december  investment grade securities generally bear lower yields and have lower degrees of risk than those that are unrated or non investment grade 
we believe that a high quality investment portfolio is more likely to generate a stable and predictable investment return

premiums earned premiums earned increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this improvement was primarily due to an increase in the number of pif from  at december  to  at december   which we attribute to the continued sales  marketing  customer interaction and product initiatives 
such factors led to a higher close ratio resulting in an increase in new policies sold on a year over year basis 
commission and fee income commission and fee income increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase in commission and fee income was a result of higher fee income related to commissionable ancillary products sold through our retail locations and the increase in pif noted above 
investment income investment income decreased to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  this decrease in investment income was primarily a result of the decline in invested assets as a result of the million used for repurchases of common stock during december and the sale in september of million of corporate bonds in order to increase the statutory capital and surplus of the insurance company subsidiaries 
at december  and  the tax equivalent book yields for our fixed maturities portfolio were and  respectively  with effective durations of and years  respectively

loss and loss adjustment expenses the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was for the year ended december   compared with for the year ended december  we experienced unfavorable development related to prior fiscal years of million for the year ended december   compared with unfavorable development of million for the year ended december  the unfavorable development for the year ended december  was primarily related to the strengthening of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
loss development was primarily related to higher than expected severity for florida personal injury protection claims and for georgia bodily injury claims in older accident years 
loss adjustment expense development was primarily related to higher than expected legal expenses for bodily injury claims for accident years and prior 
the unfavorable development for the year ended december  included amounts related to the settlement of claims for extra contractual damages 
see legal proceedings in item of this report and note to our consolidated financial statements for further information concerning this settlement 
excluding the development related to prior fiscal years  the loss and loss adjustment expense ratios for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
the year over year increase in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was primarily due to higher loss driven by an increase in frequency experienced during the second quarter of and higher expected severity for bodily injury claims 
in december  we completed the process of implementing new scored pricing programs 
we believe these new scored pricing programs provide us with greater pricing segmentation and improve our pricing relative to the risk we are insuring 
approximately of our current pif have been underwritten using these new scored pricing programs 
we perform state by state reviews of all insurance pricing programs on a quarterly basis and alter rates as we believe necessary 
in response to the increases in our loss ratio during recent quarters  we implemented rate increases on most of our non scored pricing programs during the first quarter and for our scored pricing programs in most states during the second and third quarters 
the full benefit of these rate actions will not be fully realized until all customers renew their policies under the new rates  typically six months from the date of rate change implementation 
operating expenses insurance operating expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily a result of additional costs associated with sales  marketing and customer service organizational initiatives  additional variable costs associated with higher pif  and enhancements to our underwriting processes associated with the new scored pricing programs  offset by savings realized from the closure of underperforming stores and a reduction in advertising expenses from the same period in the prior year 
in addition to the factors noted above  the increase was also greater considering the march severance and related benefits charges of million incurred in connection with the separation of certain executive officers 
the expense ratio was for the year ended december   compared with for the year ended december  excluding the severance and related benefits charges noted above  the expense ratio for the year ended december  was 
overall  the combined ratio decreased slightly to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  excluding the severance and related benefits charges noted above  the combined ratio for the year ended december  was 

table of contents first acceptance corporation k goodwill and intangible assets impairment we recorded non cash  pre tax goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges during the year ended december  of million 
we are required to perform periodic impairment tests of our goodwill and intangible assets 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process that requires us to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit based on valuation techniques  including a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts and recent industry transaction and trading multiples of our peers  and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  which includes the allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment  if any  by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of the implied fair value of goodwill of a reporting unit requires us to allocate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to its corresponding carrying value 
as a part of our annual impairment test to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at june   the fair value of our reporting unit  from a market participant s perspective  was estimated utilizing both i a cash flow projection derived from our long range strategic plan using a discount rate of  which was based on an estimated weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risks associated with our operations and ii recent industry transaction and trading trends in price to tangible book multiples and related returns on tangible equity 
as a result of recent trends in industry transaction and trading multiples  we recognized a non cash  pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million in the quarter ended june   which included a million addition to deferred tax liabilities 
indefinite lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trademarks and trade names 
in measuring the fair value for these intangible assets  we utilize the relief from royalty method 
this method assumes that trademarks and trade names have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them 
this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands  the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 
as a result of decisions made by management during the quarter ended june  regarding entity wide branding initiatives  we recognized a non cash  pre tax impairment charge of million related to trade name intangible assets 
as a part of our periodic impairment test to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at december   the fair value of our reporting unit  from a market participant s perspective  was estimated utilizing both i a cash flow projection derived from our long range strategic plan using a discount rate of  which was based on an estimated weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risks associated with our operations and ii recent industry transaction and trading trends in price to tangible book multiples and related returns on tangible equity 
using assumptions and techniques similar to those used at june   and as a result of the adverse impact of operating losses  the decline in our common stock trading prices  and the negotiated price of separate stock transactions with former executive officers that represented a significant percentage of our shares outstanding  during the quarter ended december   we recognized a non cash  pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million 
a variance in the discount rate would not have had a significant effect on the amount of the goodwill impairment charges recognized during the year ended december  the resulting determination of implied fair value of goodwill did not support any remaining goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet at december  provision benefit for income taxes the benefit for income taxes was thousand for the year ended december   compared with the provision for income taxes of million at the year ended december  the provision for income taxes related to current state income taxes for certain subsidiaries with taxable income 
at december  and  we established a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing our ability to support the realizability of our deferred tax assets  we considered both positive and negative evidence 
we placed greater weight on historical results than on our outlook for future profitability 
the deferred tax valuation allowance may be adjusted in future periods if we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
in the event the deferred tax valuation allowance is adjusted  we would record an income tax benefit for the adjustment

the expense ratio was for the six months ended december   compared with for the six months ended december  the year over year increase in the expense ratio was primarily due to the decrease in premiums earned and a higher percentage of fixed expenses in our retail operations such as rent and base salary

during september  we sold million of corporate bonds in order to increase the statutory capital and surplus of the insurance company subsidiaries

the remaining net reductions in our investment portfolio in both periods were primarily a result of maturities and redemptions 
investing activities during the year ended december  also included capital expenditures of million primarily related to the rebranding of our retail stores 
our holding company requires cash for general corporate overhead expenses and for debt service related to our debentures payable 
the holding company s primary source of unrestricted cash to meet its obligations is the sale of ancillary products to our insureds and  if necessary and available subject to state law limitations  the holding company may receive dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries 
the holding company also receives cash from operating activities as a result of investment income 
through an intercompany tax allocation arrangement  taxable losses of the holding company provide cash to the holding company to the extent that taxable income is generated by the insurance company subsidiaries 
during september  the holding company contributed million in cash to increase the statutory capital and surplus of the insurance company subsidiaries 
at december   we had million remaining available in unrestricted cash and investments outside of the insurance company subsidiaries 
these funds and the additional unrestricted cash from the sources noted above will be used to pay our future cash requirements outside of the insurance company subsidiaries

the interest rate related to the debentures was for the period from november to january in february  the interest rate reset to through april state insurance laws limit the amount of dividends that may be paid from our insurance company subsidiaries 
at december   our insurance company subsidiaries could not pay ordinary dividends without prior regulatory approval due to a negative earned surplus position 
the national association of insurance commissioners model act for risk based capital provides formulas to determine each december on an annual basis the amount of statutory capital and surplus that an insurance company needs to ensure that it has an acceptable expectation of not becoming financially impaired 
there are also statutory guidelines that suggest that on an annual calendar year basis an insurance company should not exceed a 
table of contents first acceptance corporation k ratio of net premiums written to statutory capital and surplus of to on a combined basis  the ratios for our insurance company subsidiaries of net premiums written for the last twelve months to statutory capital and surplus were to at december  based on our current forecast on a combined basis  we anticipate that our risk based capital levels will be adequate and that our ratio of net premiums written to statutory capital and surplus will not exceed the to statutory guideline for the reasonably foreseeable future 
we therefore believe that our insurance company subsidiaries have sufficient statutory capital and surplus available to support their net premium writings in this time frame 
we believe that existing cash and investment balances  when combined with anticipated cash flows as noted above  will be adequate to meet our expected liquidity needs  for both the holding company and our insurance company subsidiaries  in both the short term and the reasonably foreseeable future 
any future growth strategy may require external financing  and we may from time to time seek to obtain external financing

as more information becomes known  these estimates and assumptions could change  thus having an impact on the amounts reported in the future 
the following are considered to be our critical accounting estimates 
valuation of deferred tax asset income taxes are accounted for under the liability method  whereby deferred income tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences 
temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years 
valuation of the deferred tax asset is considered a critical accounting estimate because the determination of our ability to utilize the asset involves a number of management assumptions relating to future operations that could materially affect the determination of the ultimate value and  therefore  the carrying amount of our deferred tax asset 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets are attributable to our insurance operations and were initially recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
goodwill and other intangible assets having an indefinite useful life are not amortized for financial statement purposes 
we perform our required annual impairment tests as of june th of each fiscal year 
in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets may be impaired  an interim impairment test would be required 
intangible assets with finite lives have been fully amortized over their useful lives 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process that requires us to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit based on valuation techniques  including a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts and recent industry transaction and trading multiples of our peers  and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  which includes the allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment  if any  by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of the implied fair value of goodwill of a reporting unit requires us to allocate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to its corresponding carrying value 
our evaluation includes multiple assumptions that may change over time 
if future discounted cash flows become less than those projected by us or unfavorable trends continue  further identifiable intangible assets impairment charges may become necessary that could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations in the period in which the write off occurs 
investments our investments are recorded at fair value  which is typically based on publicly available quoted prices 
from time to time  the carrying value of our investments may be temporarily impaired because of the inherent volatility of publicly traded investments 
management reviews investments for impairment on a quarterly basis 
any decline in the fair value of any available for sale security below cost that is deemed to be other than temporary would result in a reduction in the amortized cost of the security 

table of contents first acceptance corporation k the determination of whether unrealized losses are other than temporary requires judgment based on subjective as well as objective factors 
we routinely monitor our investment portfolio for changes in fair value that might indicate potential impairments and perform detailed reviews on such securities 
changes in fair value are evaluated to determine the extent to which such changes are attributable to i fundamental factors specific to the issuer or ii market related factors such as interest rates or sector declines 
securities with declines attributable to issuer specific fundamentals are reviewed to identify all available evidence to estimate the potential for impairment 
resources used include historical financial data included in sec filings for corporate bonds and performance data regarding the underlying loans for cmos 
securities with declines attributable solely to market or sector declines where we do not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the security before the full recovery of its amortized cost basis are not deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 
losses and loss adjustment expense reserves loss and loss adjustment expense reserves represent our best estimate of our ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to events that occurred prior to the end of any given accounting period but have not been paid 
months and potentially years may elapse between the occurrence of an automobile accident covered by one of our insurance policies  the reporting of the accident and the payment of the claim 
we record a liability for estimates of losses that will be paid for accidents that have been reported  which is referred to as case reserves 
as accidents are not always reported when they occur  we estimate liabilities for accidents that have occurred but have not been reported ibnr 
we are directly liable for loss and loss adjustment expenses under the terms of the insurance policies underwritten by our insurance company subsidiaries 
each of our insurance company subsidiaries establishes a reserve for all of its unpaid losses  including case reserves and ibnr reserves  and estimates for the cost to settle the claims 
we estimate our ibnr reserves by estimating our ultimate liability for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves first  and then reducing that amount by the amount of cumulative paid claims and by the amount of our case reserves 
we rely primarily on historical loss experience in determining reserve levels  on the assumption that historical loss experience provides a good indication of future loss experience 
we also consider various other factors  such as inflation  claims settlement patterns  legislative activity and litigation trends 
our actuarial staff continually monitors these estimates on a state and coverage level 
we utilize our actuarial staff to determine appropriate reserve levels 
as experience develops or new information becomes known  we increase or decrease the level of our reserves in the period in which changes to the estimates are determined 
accordingly  the actual losses and loss adjustment expenses may differ materially from the estimates we have recorded

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
our exposures to market risk relate primarily to our investment portfolio  which is exposed primarily to interest rate risk and credit risk 
the fair value of our investment portfolio is directly impacted by changes in market interest rates  generally  the fair value of fixed income investments moves inversely with movements in market interest rates 
our fixed maturity portfolio is comprised of substantially all fixed rate investments with primarily short term and intermediate term maturities 
likewise  the underlying investments of our current mutual fund investment are also fixed income investments 
this portfolio composition allows flexibility in reacting to fluctuations of interest rates 
the portfolios of our insurance company subsidiaries are managed to achieve an adequate risk adjusted return while maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet policyholder obligations 

table of contents first acceptance corporation k interest rate risk the fair values of our fixed maturity investments fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases  respectively  in the fair values of those instruments 
additionally  the fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
the following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates resulting from parallel shifts in market yield curves on our fixed maturity portfolio in thousands 
it is assumed that the effects are realized immediately upon the change in interest rates 
the hypothetical changes in market interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios 
variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available 
for these and other reasons  actual results might differ from those reflected in the table
