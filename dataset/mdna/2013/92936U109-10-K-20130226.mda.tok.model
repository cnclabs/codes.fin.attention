business overview we provide long term financing via sale leaseback and build to suit transactions for companies worldwide and manage a global investment portfolio of  properties  including our owned portfolio 
our business operates in two segments real estate ownership and investment management  as described below

p 
carey inc as the surviving corporation  which we refer to as the merger 
additionally  on september   cpa merged with our subsidiary  with cpa surviving as our indirect wholly owned subsidiary 
as a result of both transactions  we succeeded to all of the businesses  assets and liabilities of each of w 
p 
carey co 
llc and cpa  and own all the assets previously held by  and carry on the business of each of  w 
p 
carey co 
llc and cpa we now hold substantially all of our real estate assets  including the assets acquired from cpa  in our real estate ownership segment  while the activities conducted by our investment management segment subsidiaries are organized under trss note 
real estate ownership we own and invest in commercial properties in the us and europe that are then leased to companies  primarily on a triple net lease basis  which requires the tenant to pay substantially all of the costs associated with operating and maintaining the property we earn lease revenues from our wholly owned and co owned real estate investments 
in addition  we generate equity income through our investments in the shares of the managed reits 
in addition  through our special member interests in the operating partnerships of the managed reits  we participate in the cash flows of those reits 
lastly  we earn other real estate revenues through our investments in self storage facilities and hotels in the us investment management we earn revenue as the advisor to the managed reits 
for the periods presented  we acted as advisor to the following affiliated  publicly owned  non listed managed reits cpa through the date of the cpa merger  cpa through the date of the merger  cpa global  cpa global  and cwi 
under the advisory agreements with the managed reits  we perform various services  including but not limited to the day to day management of the managed reits and transaction related services 
we structure and negotiate investments and debt placement transactions for the managed reits  for which we earn structuring revenue  and we manage their portfolios of real estate investments  for which we earn asset based management revenue 
while we are raising funds for a managed reit  the reit reimburses us for certain costs  primarily broker dealer commissions paid on its behalf and marketing and personnel costs 
the managed reits also reimburse us for many of our costs associated with the evaluation of transactions on their behalf that are not completed 
we also earn wholesaling fees and dealer manager fees in connection with the initial public offerings of the managed reits 
we reimburse  or re allow  all or a portion of the dealer manager fees to selected dealers in the offerings 
dealer manager fees that are not re allowed are classified as wholesaling revenue 
wholesaling revenue earned is generally offset by underwriting costs incurred in connection with the offerings

we evaluate our results of operations with a primary focus on increasing and enhancing the value  quality and amount of assets under management by our investment management segment and the ability to generate the cash flow necessary to meet our objectives in our real estate ownership segment 
results of operations by reportable segment are described below in results of operations 
see supplemental financial measures below for our definition of affo and a reconciliation to its most directly comparable gaap measure 
total revenues increased in as compared to the increase in revenues from our real estate ownership segment was primarily due to revenues from the properties we acquired in the merger in september and  to a lesser extent  from properties we purchased in may from cpa in connection with the cpa merger 
revenues from our investment management segment decreased during the year primarily due to the incentive  termination and subordinated disposition revenue recognized in connection with providing a liquidity event for cpa stockholders through the cpa merger in may  while in we waived the subordinated disposition and termination fees we would have been entitled to receive from cpa upon its liquidation through the merger pursuant to the terms of our advisory agreement with cpa net income attributable to w 
p 
carey decreased in as compared to results from operations in our real estate ownership segment were lower during the current year as compared to  primarily due to costs incurred in connection with the merger 
results from operations in our investment management segment decreased during the current year primarily due to the incentive  termination and subordinated disposition revenue recognized in connection with the cpa merger in that we did not receive in connection with the merger in cash flow from operating activities increased slightly during as compared to operating cash flows generated by the properties acquired in the merger was substantially offset by the subordinated disposition revenue received from cpa upon completion of the cpa merger in may that we did not receive in connection with the merger in w 
p 
carey k our annualized cash distribution increased to per share for the year ended december   from per share in the increase primarily reflects earnings generated from growth in our owned real estate portfolio and our increased ownership in  and our participation in the cash flows of  cpa global as a result of the cpa merger  as well as the additional income anticipated to result from the merger 
our affo supplemental measure decreased in as compared to  primarily due to the incentive  termination and subordinated disposition income recognized in connection with the cpa merger in that we did not receive in connection with the merger in asset management revenue decreased in because performance fees were no longer received from cpa after the cpa merger  or from cpa global after the cpa global upreit reorganization  both of which occurred in may note  and because asset management fees and performance fees are no longer being received from cpa after the merger in september these decreases were partially offset by an increase in affo in our real estate ownership segment in primarily as a result of income earned from the properties we purchased from cpa in in connection with the cpa merger and those we acquired from cpa in the merger as well as income generated from our equity interests in the managed reits  including our million incremental investment in cpa global in connection with the cpa merger 
how we evaluate results of operations we evaluate our results of operations with a primary focus on increasing and enhancing the value  quality and amount of assets under management by our investment management segment and seeking to increase value in our real estate ownership segment 
we focus our efforts on improving underperforming assets through re leasing efforts  including negotiation of lease renewals  or selectively selling assets in order to increase value in our real estate portfolio 
the ability to increase assets under management by structuring investments on behalf of the managed reits is affected  among other things  by the managed reits ability to raise capital and our ability to identify and enter into appropriate investments and financing 
our evaluation of operating results includes our ability to generate necessary cash flow in order to fund distributions to our stockholders 
as a result  our assessment of operating results gives less emphasis to the effects of unrealized gains and losses  which may cause fluctuations in net income for comparable periods but have no impact on cash flows  and to other non cash charges such as depreciation and impairment charges 
we do not consider unrealized gains and losses resulting from short term foreign currency fluctuations when evaluating our ability to fund distributions 
our evaluation of our potential for generating cash flow includes an assessment of the long term sustainability of both our real estate portfolio and the assets we manage on behalf of the managed reits 
we consider cash flows from operating activities  cash flows from investing activities  cash flows from financing activities and certain non gaap performance metrics to be important measures in the evaluation of our results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
cash flows from operating activities are sourced primarily by revenues earned from structuring investments and providing asset based management services on behalf of the managed reits and long term lease contracts from our real estate ownership 
our evaluation of the amount and expected fluctuation of cash flows from operating activities is essential in evaluating our ability to fund operating expenses  service debt and fund distributions to stockholders 
we focus on measures of cash flows from investing activities and cash flows from financing activities in our evaluation of our capital resources 
investing activities typically consist of the acquisition or disposition of investments in real property and the funding of capital expenditures with respect to real properties 
financing activities primarily consist of the payment of distributions to stockholders  borrowings and repayments under our lines of credit and the payment of mortgage principal amortization

asset management revenue we earn asset management revenue from the managed reits and  until the merger  performance revenue from cpa  based on the value of their real estate related and lodging related assets under management 
this asset management revenue may increase or decrease depending upon i increases in the managed reits asset bases as a result of new investments and  ii decreases in the managed reits asset bases as a result of sales of investments  and iii increases or decreases in the appraised value of the real estate related and lodging related assets in the managed reit investment portfolios 
we previously earned performance revenue from cpa and cpa global through the date of the cpa merger and the related cpa global upreit reorganization 
each cpa reit  as applicable  met its performance criteria for all periods presented 
the availability of funds for new investments is substantially dependent on our ability to raise funds for investment by the managed reits 
vs 
for the year ended december  as compared to  asset management revenue decreased by million 
combined asset management revenue from cpa and cpa global decreased by million  primarily due to a change in our fee arrangement with cpa global under its umbrella partnership real estate investment trust upreit structure in connection with the cpa merger 
as discussed in note  immediately after the cpa merger in may  our asset management revenue from cpa global was reduced from to of the property value of the assets under management and instead we now receive a distribution of of the available cash of cpa global s operating partnership  which we record as income from equity investments in the managed reits within the real estate ownership segment 
asset management revenue from cpa also decreased by million during the year ended december  as a result of the merger on september  and prior property sales 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in revenue of million during the year ended december  from cpa global as a result of new investments that it entered into during and vs 
for the year ended december  as compared to  asset management revenue decreased by million 
asset management decreased by million  primarily due to recent property sales by the cpa reits and the change in our fee arrangement with cpa global under its new upreit structure after the cpa merger 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenue of million during from cpa global as a result of new investments that it entered into during and structuring revenue we earn structuring revenue when we structure investments and debt placement transactions for the managed reits 
structuring revenue is dependent on investment activity  which is subject to significant period to period variation 
vs 
for the year ended december  as compared to  structuring revenue increased by million 
we structured real estate investments on behalf of the managed reits totaling approximately billion during the increase was due to the fee rates applicable to the types of transactions structured 
vs 
for the year ended december  as compared to  structuring revenue increased by million  primarily due to higher investment volume in  partially offset by the lower rate of structuring revenue earned on the self storage and hotel properties acquired on behalf of the managed reits in as compared to the rate for long term net lease investments as described below 
structuring revenue for included million related to a million transaction in italy on behalf of cpa global with a capitalization rate of approximately

we also waived any structuring revenue due from cpa global under its advisory agreement with us in connection with its acquisition of assets from cpa in the cpa merger 
w 
p 
carey k incentive  termination and subordinated disposition revenue incentive  termination and subordinated disposition revenue is generally earned in connection with events in which we provide liquidity or alternatives to the managed reits stockholders 
these events do not occur every year  although one occurred in each of and as described in note  we waived the subordinated disposition fees that we would have been entitled to receive from cpa upon its liquidity event through the merger pursuant to the terms of our advisory agreement with cpa in connection with providing a liquidity event for cpa shareholders through the cpa merger in may  we earned termination revenue of million and subordinated disposition revenue of million  which we received in shares of cpa and cash  respectively 
these cpa shares were subsequently converted to shares of cpa global in connection with the cpa merger 
wholesaling revenue we also earned a wholesaling fee of per share sold in connection with cpa global s initial public offering through the termination of that offering on april  as discussed in note  we earned a dealer manager fee of up to per share sold in connection with cpa global s follow on offering  which commenced on april  and terminated on january  we also earn a dealer manager fee per share sold in connection with cwi s ongoing initial public offering 
we also re allow all or a portion of the dealer manager fees to selected dealers in the offerings 
dealer manager fees that are not re allowed are classified as wholesaling revenue 
wholesaling revenue earned is generally offset by underwriting costs incurred in connection with the offerings  which are included in general and administrative expenses 
vs 
for the year ended december  as compared to  wholesaling revenue increased by million  primarily due to increases in shares sold in connection with cpa global and cwi offerings in compared to the prior year 
vs 
for the year ended december  as compared to  wholesaling revenue increased by million  primarily due to shares sold in connection with cwi s initial public offering  for which the issuance of shares commenced on march   partially offset by a decrease in the number of shares sold related to cpa global s offerings 
reimbursed and reimbursable costs reimbursed costs revenue from affiliates and reimbursable costs expenses represent costs incurred by us on behalf of the managed reits  consisting primarily of broker dealer commissions and marketing and personnel costs  which are reimbursed by the managed reits 
revenue from reimbursed costs from affiliates is offset by corresponding charges to reimbursable costs 
vs 
for the year ended december  as compared to  reimbursed and reimbursable costs increased by million  primarily due to an increase of million in commissions paid to broker dealers related to the cpa global and cwi offerings as a result of corresponding increases in funds raised

for the year ended december  as compared to  general and administrative expenses increased by million primarily due to an increase in compensation expense of million and an increase of million in underwriting costs related to the cpa global and cwi offerings 
these increases were partially offset by a million increase in cost reimbursements from the managed reits 
compensation costs increased million due to an increase in stock based compensation expense  which was primarily the result of awards issued during with higher fair values  and million due to an increase in the number of personnel during vs 
for the year ended december  as compared to  general and administrative expenses increased by million primarily due to increases in compensation related costs of million and professional fees of million 
compensation related costs were higher in due to several factors  including an increase of million in the amortization of stock based compensation and an increase of million in our expected bonus payout as a result of higher investment volumes in stock based compensation increased in as a result of changes in the expected vesting of performance share units psus granted in w

despite these fluctuations  we believe that we will generate sufficient cash from operations and from equity distributions in excess of equity income in real estate to meet our normal recurring short term and long term liquidity needs 
we may also use existing cash resources  the proceeds of mortgage loans  unused capacity on our revolver and the issuance of additional w

we assess our ability to access capital on an ongoing basis 
our sources and uses of cash during the year are described below 
operating activities cash flow from operating activities increased by million during as compared to operating cash flow generated from the properties acquired from cpa was substantially offset by merger related expenses paid during also contributing to a decrease in cash flow from operating activities as compared to was the subordinated disposition revenue from cpa upon completion of the cpa merger received in cash in may additionally  increases in cash distributions received from the operating partnerships of cpa global and cpa global were substantially offset by increases in the cash portion of general and administrative expenses 
in addition to cash flow from operating activities  we may use the following sources to fund distributions to stockholders distributions received from equity investments in excess of equity income  net contributions from noncontrolling interests  borrowings under our senior credit facility and existing cash resources 
investing activities our investing activities are generally comprised of real estate related transactions purchases and sales and capitalized property related costs 
during  we paid million  representing the cash portion of the merger consideration  to cpa stockholders and acquired million of cash in the merger 
we also made other investments and capital expenditures of million  including the walgreens transaction note

we believe  based on the results of these reviews  that our properties were in substantial compliance with federal  state  and foreign environmental statutes at the time the properties were acquired 
however  portions of certain properties have been subject to some degree of contamination  principally in connection with leakage from underground storage tanks  surface spills or other on site activities 
in most instances where contamination has been identified  tenants are actively engaged in the remediation process and addressing identified conditions 
tenants are generally subject to environmental statutes and regulations regarding the discharge of hazardous materials and any related remediation obligations 
in addition  our leases generally require tenants to indemnify us from all liabilities and losses related to the leased properties and the provisions of such indemnifications specifically address environmental matters 
the leases generally include provisions that allow for periodic environmental assessments  paid for by the tenant  and allow us to extend leases until such time as a tenant has satisfied its environmental obligations 
certain of our leases allow us to require financial assurances from tenants  such as performance bonds or letters of credit  if the costs of remediating environmental conditions are  in our estimation  in excess of specified amounts 
accordingly  we believe that the ultimate resolution of environmental matters should not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note many of these accounting policies require judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions when applying these policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
on a quarterly w 
p 
carey k basis  we evaluate these estimates and judgments based on historical experience as well as other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates are subject to change in the future if underlying assumptions or factors change 
certain accounting policies  while significant  may not require the use of estimates 
those accounting policies that require significant estimation and or judgment are listed below 
purchase price allocation in connection with our acquisition of properties  we allocate the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values 
we determine the value of tangible assets  consisting of land and buildings  as if vacant  and record intangible assets  including the above and below market value of leases  and the value of in place leases  at their relative estimated fair values 
tangible assets we determine the value attributed to tangible assets and additional investments in equity interests by applying a discounted cash flow model that is intended to approximate both what a third party would pay to purchase the vacant property and rent at current estimated market rates at a selected capitalization rate 
in applying the model  we assume that the disinterested party would sell the property at the end of an estimated market lease term 
assumptions used in the model are property specific where this information is available  however  when certain necessary information is not available  we use available regional and property type information 
assumptions and estimates include the following a discount rate or internal rate of return  the marketing period necessary to put a lease in place  carrying costs during the marketing period  leasing commissions and tenant improvement allowances  market rents and growth factors of these rents  and a market lease term and a cap rate to be applied to an estimate of market rent at the end of the market lease term 
the discount rates and residual capitalization rates used to value the properties are selected based on several factors  including the creditworthiness of the lessees  industry surveys  property type  location and age  current lease rates relative to market lease rates  and anticipated lease duration 
in the case where a tenant has a purchase option deemed to be favorable to the tenant  or the tenant has long term renewal options at rental rates below estimated market rental rates  the appraisal assumes the exercise of such purchase option or long term renewal options in its determination of residual value 
where a property is deemed to have excess land  the discounted cash flow analysis includes the estimated excess land value at the assumed expiration of the lease  based upon an analysis of comparable land sales or listings in the general market area of the property grown at estimated market growth rates through the year of lease expiration 
the remaining economic life of leased assets is estimated by relying in part upon third party appraisals of the leased assets  industry standards and based on our experience 
different estimates of remaining economic life will affect the depreciation expense that is recorded 
intangible assets when we acquire properties subject to net leases  we determine the value of above market and below market lease intangibles based on the difference between i the contractual rents to be paid pursuant to the leases negotiated and in place at the time of acquisition of the properties and ii our estimate of fair market lease rates for the property or a similar property  both of which are measured over a period equal to the estimated lease term  which includes any renewal options with rental rates below estimated market rental rates 
we discount the difference between the estimated market rent and contractual rent to a present value using an interest rate reflecting our w 
p 
carey k current assessment of the risk associated with the lease acquired  which includes a consideration of the credit of the lessee 
estimates of market rent are generally determined by us relying in part upon a third party appraisal obtained in connection with the property acquisition and can include estimates of market rent increase factors  which are generally provided in the appraisal or by local real estate brokers 
we measure the fair value of below market purchase option liabilities we acquire as the excess of the present value of the fair value of the real estate over the present value of the tenant s exercise price 
we evaluate the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and any pre existing relationship with each tenant in determining the value of in place lease intangibles 
to determine the value of in place lease intangibles  we consider the following estimated market rent  estimated lease term including renewal options at rental rates below estimated market rental rates  estimated carrying costs of the property during a hypothetical expected lease up period  and current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
estimated carrying costs of the property include real estate taxes  insurance  other property operating costs  and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the market participants expected lease up periods  based on assessments of specific market conditions 
we determine these values using our estimates or by relying in part upon third party appraisals conducted by independent appraisal firms 
goodwill in the case of a business combination  after identifying all tangible and intangible assets and liabilities  the excess consideration paid over the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired and assumed  respectively  represents goodwill 
we allocate goodwill to the respective reporting units in which such goodwill arose 
we evaluate goodwill on an annual basis 
the goodwill recorded in our investment reporting unit is evaluated in the fourth quarter of every year 
in connection with the merger  we recorded goodwill in our real estate ownership reporting unit 
prior to the merger  there was no goodwill recorded in our real estate ownership reporting unit 
we will evaluate the goodwill recorded in our real estate ownership reporting unit in the second quarter of every year 
impairments we periodically assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our long lived assets  including goodwill  may be impaired or that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
these impairment indicators include  but are not limited to  the vacancy of a property that is not subject to a lease  a lease default by a tenant that is experiencing financial difficulty  the termination of a lease by a tenant  or the rejection of a lease in a bankruptcy proceeding 
we may incur impairment charges on long lived assets  including real estate  direct financing leases  assets held for sale and equity investments in real estate 
we may also incur impairment charges on marketable securities and goodwill 
estimates and judgments used when evaluating whether these assets are impaired are presented below 
real estate for real estate assets that we intend to hold and use in which an impairment indicator is identified  we follow a two step process to determine whether an asset is impaired and to determine the amount of the charge 
first  we compare the carrying value of the property s asset group to the future net undiscounted cash flow that we expect the property s asset group will generate  including any estimated proceeds from the eventual sale of the property s asset group 
the undiscounted cash flow analysis requires us to make our best estimate of market rents  residual values and holding periods 
we estimate market rents and residual values using market information from outside sources such as broker quotes or recent comparable sales 
in cases where the available market information is not deemed appropriate  we perform a future net cash flow analysis discounted for inherent risk associated with each asset to determine an estimated fair value 
as our investment objective is to hold properties on a long term basis  holding periods used in the undiscounted cash flow analysis generally range from five to ten years 
depending on the assumptions made and estimates used  the future cash flow projected in the evaluation of long lived assets can vary within a range of outcomes 
we consider the likelihood of possible outcomes in determining our estimate of future cash flows 
if the future net undiscounted cash flow of the property s asset group is less than the carrying value  the carrying value of the property s asset group is considered not recoverable 
we then measure the impairment loss as the excess of the carrying value of the property s asset group over its estimated fair value 
the property asset group s estimated fair value is primarily determined using market information from outside sources such as broker quotes or recent comparable sales 
w 
p 
carey k assets held for sale we classify real estate assets that are accounted for as operating leases as held for sale when we have entered into a contract to sell the property  all material due diligence requirements have been satisfied and we believe it is probable that the disposition will occur within one year 
when we classify an asset as held for sale  we carry the investment at the lower of its current carrying value or as the expected sale price  less expected selling costs 
we base the expected sale price on the contract and the expected selling costs on information provided by brokers and legal counsel 
we then compare the asset s expected sales price  less expected selling costs to its carrying value  and if the expected sales price  less expected selling costs is less than the property s carrying value  we reduce the carrying value to the expected sales price  less expected selling costs 
we will continue to review the initial impairment for subsequent changes in the expected sales price  and may recognize an additional impairment charge if warranted 
direct financing leases we review our direct financing leases at least annually to determine whether there has been an other than temporary decline in the current estimate of residual value of the property 
the residual value is our estimate of what we could realize upon the sale of the property at the end of the lease term  based on market information and third party estimates where available 
if this review indicates that a decline in residual value has occurred that is other than temporary  we recognize an impairment charge and revise the accounting for the direct financing lease to reflect a portion of the future cash flow from the lessee as a return of principal rather than as revenue 
when we enter into a contract to sell the real estate assets that are recorded as direct financing leases  we evaluate whether we believe it is probable that the disposition will occur 
if we determine that the disposition is probable and therefore the asset s holding period is reduced  we record an allowance for credit losses to reflect the change in the estimate of the undiscounted future rents 
accordingly  the net investment balance is written down to fair value 
equity investments in real estate and the managed reits we evaluate our equity investments in real estate and in the managed reits on a periodic basis to determine if there are any indicators that the value of our equity investment may be impaired and to establish whether or not that impairment is other than temporary 
to the extent impairment has occurred  we measure the charge as the excess of the carrying value of our investment over its estimated fair value  which is determined by multiplying the estimated fair value of the underlying investment s net assets by our ownership interest percentage 
for our unconsolidated jointly owned investments in real estate  we calculate the estimated fair value of the underlying investment s real estate or net investment in direct financing lease as described in real estate and direct financing leases above 
the fair value of the underlying investment s debt  if any  is calculated based on market interest rates and other market information 
the fair value of the underlying investment s other financial assets and liabilities excluding net investment in direct financing leases have fair values that approximate their carrying values 
for our investments in certain managed reits  we calculate the estimated fair value of our investment using the most recently published net asset value per share nav of each managed reit  which for cpa global and cwi  is deemed to be their initial public offering prices 
goodwill we evaluate goodwill for possible impairment at least annually or upon the occurrence of a triggering event using a two step process 
to identify any impairment  we first compare the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units with their respective carrying amount  including goodwill 
we calculate the estimated fair value of the investment management reporting unit by applying a multiple  based on comparable companies  to earnings 
for the real estate ownership reporting unit  we calculate its estimated fair value by applying a multiple common to the real estate industry 
the selection of the comparable companies and transactions to be used in our evaluation process could have a significant impact on the fair value of our reporting units and possible impairments 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  we do not consider goodwill to be impaired and no further analysis is required 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  we then perform the second step to determine and measure the amount of the potential impairment charge 
for the second step  we compare the implied fair value of the goodwill for each reporting unit with its respective carrying amount and record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the implied fair value 
we determine the implied fair value of the goodwill by allocating the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its assets and liabilities 
the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of the goodwill

carey k we evaluate goodwill on an annual basis or upon the occurrence of a triggering event 
our annual impairment test for the goodwill recorded in our investment reporting unit is evaluated in the fourth quarter of every year 
as discussed in note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  in connection with the merger we recorded goodwill in our real estate ownership reporting unit 
prior to the merger  there was no goodwill recorded in our real estate ownership reporting unit 
we will evaluate the goodwill recorded in our real estate ownership reporting unit in the second quarter of every year 
proposed accounting changes the following proposed accounting changes may potentially impact our real estate ownership and investment management segments if the outcome has a significant influence on sale leaseback demand in the marketplace the iasb and fasb have issued an exposure draft on a joint proposal that would dramatically transform lease accounting from the existing model 
these changes would impact most companies but are particularly applicable to those that are significant users of real estate 
the proposal outlines a completely new model for accounting by lessees  whereby their rights and obligations under substantially all leases  existing and new  would be capitalized and recorded on the balance sheet 
for some companies  the new accounting guidance may influence whether or not  or the extent to which  they may enter into the type of sale leaseback transactions in which we specialize 
the fasb and iasb met during the third quarter of and voted to re expose the proposed standard 
a revised exposure draft for public comment is currently expected to be issued in  with a final standard expected to be issued during the boards also reached decisions  which are tentative and subject to change  on a single lessor accounting model and the accounting for variable lease payments  along with several presentation and disclosure issues 
as of the date of this report  the proposed guidance has not yet been finalized  and as such we are unable to determine whether this proposal will have a material impact on our business 
supplemental financial measures in the real estate industry  analysts and investors employ certain non gaap supplemental financial measures in order to facilitate meaningful comparisons between periods and among peer companies 
additionally  in the formulation of our goals and in the evaluation of the effectiveness of our strategies  we employ the use of supplemental non gaap measures  which are uniquely defined by our management 
we believe that these measures are useful to investors to consider because they may assist them to better understand and measure the performance of our business over time and against similar companies 
a description of these non gaap financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap measures are provided below 
funds from operations as adjusted funds from operations ffo is a non gaap measure defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit 
nareit defines ffo as net income or loss as computed in accordance with gaap excluding depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets  impairment charges on real estate  gains or losses from sales of depreciated real estate assets and extraordinary items  however  ffo related to assets held for sale  sold or otherwise transferred and included in the results of discontinued operations are included 
these adjustments also incorporate the pro rata share of unconsolidated subsidiaries 
ffo is used by management  investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers 
although nareit has published this definition of ffo  companies often modify this definition as they seek to provide financial measures that meaningfully reflect their distinctive operations 
we modify the nareit computation of ffo to include other adjustments to gaap net income to adjust for certain non cash charges such as amortization of real estate related intangibles  deferred income tax benefits and expenses  straight line rents  stock compensation  gains or losses from extinguishment of debt and deconsolidation of subsidiaries and unrealized foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
additionally  we exclude expenses related to the merger which are considered non recurring  and realized gains losses on foreign exchange and derivatives  which are not considered fundamental attributes of our business plan and do not affect our overall long term operating performance 
we refer to our modified definition of ffo as affo 
we exclude these items from gaap net income as they are not the primary drivers in our decision making process 
our assessment of our operations is focused on long term sustainability and not on such non cash items  which may cause short term fluctuations in net income but have no impact on cash flows  and we therefore use affo as one measure of our operating performance when we formulate corporate goals  evaluate the effectiveness of our strategies  and determine executive compensation 
we believe that affo is a useful supplemental measure for investors to consider because it will help them to better assess the sustainability of our operating performance without the potentially distorting impact of these short term fluctuations 
however  there are limits on the usefulness of affo to investors 
for example  impairment charges and unrealized foreign currency losses that we w 
p 
carey k exclude may become actual realized losses upon the ultimate disposition of the properties in the form of lower cash proceeds or other considerations 
we use our ffo and affo measures as supplemental financial measures of operating performance 
we do not use our ffo and affo measures as  nor should they be considered to be  alternatives to net earnings computed under gaap or as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under gaap or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs

in connection with purchasing these properties  we recognized a net gain of million during the year ended december  to adjust the carrying value of our existing interests in these investments to their estimated fair values 
c gain on change in control of interests for the year ended december  represents a gain of million recognized on our previously held interest in shares of cpa common stock  and a gain of million recognized on the purchase of the remaining interests in five investments from cpa  which we had previously accounted for under the equity method 
we recognized a net gain of million to adjust the carrying value of our existing interests in these investments to their estimated fair values 
d these adjustments were not significant prior to the merger  therefore  they were not included in the calculation of affo in and e amount included million of general and administrative expenses and million of income tax expenses incurred in connection with the merger 
while we believe that ffo and affo are important supplemental measures  they should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indication of a company s operating performance 
these non gaap measures should be used in conjunction with net income as defined by gaap 
ffo and affo  or similarly titled measures disclosed by other real estate investment trusts  may not be comparable to our ffo and affo measures

carey k item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 
the primary risks to which we are exposed are interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk 
we are also exposed to further market risk as a result of concentrations of tenants in certain industries and or geographic regions 
adverse market factors can affect the ability of tenants in a particular industry region to meet their respective lease obligations 
in order to manage this risk  we view our collective tenant roster as a portfolio  and in our investment decisions we attempt to diversify our portfolio so that we are not overexposed to a particular industry or geographic region 
generally  we do not use derivative instruments to hedge credit market risks or for speculative purposes 
however  from time to time  we may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency cash flow exposures 
interest rate risk the value of our real estate and related fixed rate debt obligations is subject to fluctuations based on changes in interest rates 
the value of our real estate is also subject to fluctuations based on local and regional economic conditions and changes in the creditworthiness of lessees  all of which may affect our ability to refinance property level mortgage debt when balloon payments are scheduled 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions  and other factors beyond our control 
an increase in interest rates would likely cause the value of our owned and managed assets to decrease  which would create lower revenues from managed assets and lower investment performance for the managed funds 
increases in interest rates may also have an impact on the credit profile of certain tenants 
we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our borrowing activities 
to limit this exposure  we attempt to obtain non recourse mortgage financing on a long term  fixed rate basis 
however  from time to time  we or our joint investment partners may obtain variable rate non recourse mortgage loans and  as a result  may enter into interest rate swap agreements or interest rate cap agreements with lenders that effectively convert the variable rate debt service obligations of the loan to a fixed rate or limit the underlying interest rate from exceeding a specified strike rate  respectively 
interest rate swaps are agreements in which one party exchanges a stream of interest payments for a counterparty s stream of cash flow over a specific period  and interest rate caps limit the effective borrowing rate of variable rate debt obligations while allowing participants to share in downward shifts in interest rates 
these interest rate swaps and caps are derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges on the forecasted interest payments on the debt obligation 
the notional  or face  amount on which the swaps or caps are based is not exchanged 
our objective in using these derivatives is to limit our exposure to interest rate movements 
at december   we estimate that the net fair value of our interest rate swaps and caps  which are included in other assets  net and accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated financial statements  was in a liability position of million 
at december   a significant portion approximately of our long term debt either bore interest at fixed rates  was swapped or capped to a fixed rate  or bore interest at fixed rates that were scheduled to convert to then prevailing market fixed rates at certain future points during their term 
the annual interest rates on our fixed rate debt at december  ranged from to 
the annual interest rates on our variable rate debt at december  ranged from to 
our debt obligations are more fully described under financial condition in item above 
the following table presents principal cash flows based upon expected maturity dates of our debt obligations outstanding at december  in thousands thereafter total fair value fixed rate debt variable rate debt the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt and our variable rate debt that currently bears interest at fixed rates or has effectively been converted to a fixed rate through the use of interest rate swaps or that has been subject to interest rate caps is affected by changes in interest rates 
a decrease or increase in interest rates of would change the estimated fair value of this debt at december  by an aggregate increase of million or an aggregate decrease of million  respectively 
annual interest expense on our unhedged variable rate debt that does not bear interest at fixed rates at december  would increase or decrease by million for each respective change in annual interest rates 
as more fully described under financial condition summary of financing in item above  a portion of the debt classified as variable rate debt in the tables above bore interest at fixed rates at december  w 
p 
carey k but has interest rate reset features that will change the fixed interest rates to then prevailing market fixed rates at certain points during their term 
such debt is generally not subject to short term fluctuations in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we own investments in the european union and as a result are subject to risk from the effects of exchange rate movements in various foreign currencies  primarily the euro  which may affect future costs and cash flows 
we manage foreign currency exchange rate movements by generally placing both our debt obligation to the lender and the tenant s rental obligation to us in the same currency 
this reduces our overall exposure to the equity that we have invested and the equity portion of our cash flow 
we are generally a net receiver of these currencies we receive more cash than we pay out  and therefore our foreign operations benefit from a weaker us dollar  and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar  relative to the foreign currency 
for the year ended december   we recognized net realized loss and unrealized foreign currency transaction gain of million and million  respectively 
these losses are included in other income and expenses in the consolidated financial statements and were primarily due to changes in the value of the euro on accrued interest receivable on notes receivable from consolidated subsidiaries 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain of our foreign currency cash flow exposures 
a foreign currency forward contract is a commitment to deliver a certain amount of foreign currency at a certain price on a specific date in the future 
the net estimated fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts  which are included in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated financial statements  was in a net liability position of million at december  we obtain non recourse mortgage financing in the local currency in order to mitigate our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to the extent that currency fluctuations increase or decrease rental revenues as translated to us dollars  the change in debt service  as translated to us dollars  will partially offset the effect of fluctuations in revenue and  to some extent  mitigate the risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
scheduled future minimum rents  exclusive of renewals  under non cancelable operating leases  for our consolidated foreign operations as of december   during each of the next five years and thereafter  are as follows in thousands lease revenues a thereafter total euro british pound sterling scheduled debt service payments principal and interest for mortgage notes payable for our consolidated foreign operations as of december  during each of the next five years and thereafter  are as follows in thousands debt service a b thereafter total euro c british pound sterling d a amounts are based on the applicable exchange rates at december  contractual rents and debt obligations are denominated in the functional currency of the country of each property 
b interest on unhedged variable rate debt obligations was calculated using the applicable annual interest rates and balances outstanding at december  c we estimate that for a increase or decrease in the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar  there would be a corresponding change in the projected property level cash flow at december  of million 
d we estimate that for a increase or decrease in the exchange rate between the british pound sterling and the us dollar  there would be a corresponding change the projected property level cash flow at december  of million 
as a result of scheduled balloon payments on our international non recourse mortgage loans  projected debt service obligations exceed projected lease revenues in and in and  balloon payments totaling million and million  respectively  are due in each year on five non recourse mortgage loans that are collateralized by properties that we own with affiliates 
we currently anticipate that  by their respective due dates  we will have refinanced certain of these loans  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so on favorable terms  if at all 
if that has not occurred  we would expect to use our cash resources  including unused capacity on our revolver  to make these payments  if necessary
