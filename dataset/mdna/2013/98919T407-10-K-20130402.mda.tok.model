toreador resources corporation prior to the combination  toreador was a publicly held independent energy company engaged in the exploration and production of crude oil with interests in developed and undeveloped oil properties in the paris basin  france 
at the time of the combination  toreador operated solely in the paris basin and its operations consisted of i a joint venture with hess corporation in the paris basin focused on unconventional resources and ii conventional paris basin assets held by zaza energy france sas 
the unconventional resource joint venture with hess stalled due to french governmental regulations 
zaza ended the hess paris venture in july by exchanging its working interest in the paris basin exploration licenses it held together with hess for a cost free revenue interest in such licenses  in which the total proceeds relating thereto to zaza are capped at million 
following zaza s exit from the unconventional resource play in france  zaza divested its paris basin conventional assets in december through the sale of of the shares in zaza energy france sas to vermillion rep sas  a wholly owned subsidiary of vermillion energy inc  for a net sales price of approximately million 
at the end of  zaza s only exploration and production asset in france was the hess royalty interest  which is held by zaza 
recent development in business relationships after the termination of the hess joint venture and the disposition of its french oil and gas properties  zaza s principal assets were approximately  net acres in the eagle ford core and approximately  net acres in the eaglebine 
the company strategic objectives since then have focused on executing drilling operations to further appraise its acreage and evaluating joint venture opportunities to realize its development 
since the dissolution of the hess joint ventures  zaza has drilled two wells in the eaglebine and one well in the eagle ford and has entered into the joint venture with eog resources  inc described below 
eaglebine joint venture with eog on march   we entered into a joint exploration and development agreement with eog resources  inc  our counterparty  for the joint development of certain of our eaglebine properties located in walker  grimes  madison  trinity  and montgomery counties  texas 
under this agreement  we and our counterparty will jointly develop up to approximately  gross acres approximately  net acres that zaza currently owns in the eaglebine trend in these counties 
our counterparty will act as the operator and will pay us certain cash amounts  the drilling and completion costs of certain specified wells  and a portion of our share of any additional seismic or well costs in order to earn their interest in these properties 
generally  zaza will retain a working interest  our counterparty will earn a working interest in the acreage  subject to the agreement  that is currently owned by zaza 
zaza will retain a working interest  our counterparty will earn a working interest  and range will retain a working interest in the acreage that is currently owned by zaza and by range  subject to the terms of our agreement with range 
this joint development will be divided into three phases 
in the first phase  we will transfer  net acres  approximately  of which will come from our joint venture with range  to our counterparty in exchange for a cash payment by our counterparty to us of million and an obligation of our counterparty to drill and pay of the drilling and completion costs of three wells 
the second of these three wells to be drilled will be the substitute well that we are required to drill pursuant to our agreement with range described above 
drilling operations on the third well in the first phase of joint development with our counterparty must be commenced by our counterparty before december  within days of completion of the third well under the first phase  our counterparty will have the option to elect to go forward with the second phase of the joint development 
if they so elect  we will transfer an additional  net acres to our counterparty in exchange for a cash payment of million  an obligation of our counterparty to drill and pay of the drilling and completions costs of an additional three wells  and an obligation of our counterparty to pay for up to million of zaza s share of additional costs for seismic or well costs 
within days of completion of the second phase  our counterparty will have the option to elect to go forward with the third phase of the joint development 
if they so elect  we will transfer an additional  net acres to our counterparty in exchange for a cash payment of million  an obligation of our counterparty to drill and pay of the drilling and completion costs of an additional three wells  and an obligation of our counterparty to pay for up to million of zaza s share of additional costs for seismic or well costs 
sale of moulton acreage on march  the company entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell its remaining moulton prospect for approximately million 
this transaction is expected to close on or before april  and is subject to normal closing conditions 
on march   we entered into an agreement to sell approximately  net acres of our properties in the eagle ford trend located in fayette  gonzalez and lavaca counties  texas  which we refer to as our moulton properties  including seven producing wells located on the moulton properties  for approximately million in cash 
the closing of the sale of the moulton properties is expected to occur during the second quarter of  and net proceeds from the sale  after closing purchase price adjustments and expenses  are expected to be approximately million 
the closing is subject to normal closing conditions  and the amendment of zaza s securities purchase agreement for its senior secured notes  and there can be no assurance that this transaction will be consummated 
we intend to use these net proceeds to fund a portion of capital expenditures for exploration on our other properties and or to repay indebtedness 
strategy zaza s strategy is to identify prospective unconventional acreage  appraise such acreage and then realize the development of high graded units through a combination of self funded development and joint ventures 
to this end  zaza maintains a team of technical and commercial personnel with experience in unconventional resources 
zaza s operations in the hess venture demonstrated a track record of identifying prospective unconventional acreage  acquiring material land positions  and appraising and developing such acreage as its operator 
as zaza evaluates additional joint venture opportunities with other companies  zaza will evaluate whether a transition of operatorship to the joint venture partner is appropriate 
when transition occurs  zaza can then redeploy its personnel to the evaluation and acquisition of new acreage  the development of its self funded acreage and or the delineation of other areas that it is considering for joint ventures 
areas of operations zaza owns producing and non producing oil and gas properties in proven or prospective basins that are primarily located in south texas 
zaza s producing areas are in the eagle ford shale located in gonzales  fayette  dewitt  and lavaca counties 
zaza also owns prospective acreage in the eaglebine formation located in madison  grimes  and walker counties 
all of zaza assets other than the overriding royalty interest in certain french production licenses obtained in connection with the dissolution of the hess joint venture  including long lived assets  are located within the united states 
the following is a summary of its major operating areas 
eagle ford shale for the year ending december   zaza drilled or participated in gross wells and net wells all successful in the eagle ford shale 
zaza also operated of the boening a h well  which began initial flow back in february zaza also installed a pumping unit on its crabb ranch well in gonzales county sustaining production rates over bbls per day 
in  zaza eagle ford operations were conducted as zaza operations on the boening a h and non operated participation with georesources halcon on the ring unit through wells 
as of december   zaza owns operating interest in four eagle ford producing wells and non operating working interests in ten eagle ford producing wells located in south texas 
our management intends to continue to acquire non operating working interests in both prospective and producing wells when the opportunity arises and to acquire such properties at attractive valuations 
such interests may be in wells that are considered either conventional or unconventional 
eaglebine shale the eaglebine is an expansion area of the eagle ford shale  but is also prospective for the woodbine shale as well as the lower cretaceous comingled conventional section  hence the industry term eaglebine 
zaza was in the process of drilling gross  net wells in the eaglebine shale area across the december  timeline one horizontal well targeting the lower eaglebine shale stingray a h and one vertical well targeting the lower cretaceous commodore a v 
zaza s operations on the stingray a h successfully drilled a vertical pilot hole through the lower eaglebine section obtaining critical open hole logs and core data 
zaza then plugged back and successfully drilled a lateral targeting the lower eaglebine section  ran production casing and fracked of stages 
at that point the wellbore suffered a casing collar failure in the casing 
zaza has re entered the wellbore to drill vertically to the lower cretaceous 
zaza also commenced drilling the commodore a v  a vertical well designed to test the lower cretaceous section 
this well reached total depth and production casing was run on february  zaza plans to continue drilling vertical and horizontal wells to demonstrate the commercial viability of the play 
once demonstrated  zaza plans to move into the development phase  where it may drill up to one well per month  subject to availability of capital resources to do so 
the company continues to exercise options and extensions maintaining the eaglebine leases 
on march   zaza llc announced that it had entered into a farm in transaction with range to increase its position in the eaglebine 
currently  zaza holds approximately  gross acres  net acres in the eaglebine 
zaza s eaglebine operations are wholly owned  but zaza intends to explore ways to accelerate the drilling program on its eaglebine acreage by selectively partnering with others 
the first such joint venture is the eog jv 
zaza also expects to finance a portion of its eaglebine program with cash flow from operations 
if cash flow from operations is not sufficient to fund this program  zaza would be required to seek additional financing to maintain and expand this program 
title to properties zaza believes it has satisfactory title to all of its producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry 
as is customary in the oil and gas industry  zaza makes title investigations and receives title opinions of local counsel not on acquisition but only before it commences drilling operations 
zaza believes that it has satisfactory title to all of its other assets 
zaza properties are subject to customary royalty interests  liens incident to operating agreements  liens for current taxes and other burdens  including other mineral encumbrances and restrictions 
although title to its properties is subject to encumbrances in certain cases  zaza believes that none of these burdens will materially detract from the value of zaza properties or from its interest therein or will materially interfere with its use of the properties in the operation of its business

we have determined the horizontal portion of the stingray to be dry due to the casing restriction and have recorded million in exploration expense 
these wells are located in our eaglebine area 
additionally  of the gross wells  net  drilled in  were in the cotulla area which was divested in the hess joint venture dissolution 
marketing and customers prior to the dissolution of the hess joint venture  zaza energy  llc was dependent upon hess for all of its oil sales revenue  which had been primarily delivered from two purchasers  shell oil and superior oil company 
with the dissolution of the joint venture  zaza retained production from three operated producing eagle ford shale wells 
sales revenue from these wells is delivered from gulfmark energy gulfmark  however  multiple purchaser options exist for this production 
all existing purchaser contracts are on monthly or evergreen terms 
our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if this purchaser fails to pay or ceases to acquire its production on terms that are favorable to us  or if the purchaser decreases demand 
should this occur  we are confident we can obtain new contracts that are similar in terms and conditions  and we do not anticipate a significant fluctuation in operations or sales 
we currently receive favorable pricing for crude oil produced from our operated eagle ford shale properties due to the high quality content of the crude and the geographic location of the production 
the crude is considered sweet because of its low sulfur content and light because it has api gravity between to degrees 
since the production exists in relatively close proximity to refineries in corpus christi and houston  we are able to acquire favorable end market optionality 
crude oil can be transported via truck or pipeline to these markets  or to barge terminals which give us access to several refineries along the texas and louisiana gulf coast 
these options allow us to take advantage of favorable price differentials between west texas intermediate wti and louisiana light sweet lls markets 
we currently receive an average net price in excess of per barrel above wti 
since the third quarter of  zaza has contracted texla energy management  inc texla to serve as its agent for the marketing and sale of natural gas production 
we receive revenue from natural gas sales and natural gas liquid sales from our three producing eagle ford shale wells 
with current market conditions  we do not receive significant revenue from these sales  however  the high natural gas liquid content of the gas stream and high recovery percentage of these liquids translates into a net price that is well above the nymex settlement price 
one hundred percent of revenue derived from gas sales is attributable to domestic customers and not foreign customers 
limited gas production that is not sold to texla is flared 
in addition to our eagle ford shale contracts  zaza energy  llc has also received bids from multiple buyers for both crude oil and natural gas production from its eaglebine properties 
with multiple buyer options  we believe we can assure competitive pricing  reduce buyer credit exposure and market production quickly if needed 
given the similar quality content of the crude oil and the same geographic location advantage as our existing production  we expect to receive a premium price for our crude oil that is as favorable as our eagle ford shale production 
gas gathering and processing options are limited for our eaglebine properties and will be addressed on a well by well basis 
we are in the process of negotiating central gas gathering and processing options for all future eaglebine production 
competition the oil and gas industry is highly competitive  and we compete with a substantial number of other companies that have greater resources than us 
many of these companies explore for  produce and market oil and gas  carry on refining operations and market the resulting products on a worldwide basis 
the primary areas in which we encounter substantial competition are in locating and acquiring desirable leasehold acreage for development operations  locating and acquiring attractive producing oil and gas properties  and obtaining purchasers and transporters of the oil and gas it produces 
there is also competition between producers of oil and gas and other industries producing alternative energy and fuel 
furthermore  competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and or regulation considered from time to time by the federal  state and local government 
it is not possible to predict the nature of any such legislation or regulation that may ultimately be adopted or its effects upon its future operations 
such legislation and regulations may  however  substantially increase the costs of exploring for  or the development  production or marketing of oil and gas and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuation of a given operation 
the effect of these risks cannot be accurately predicted

insurance matters as is common in the oil and gas industry  we do not insure fully against all risks associated with our business either because such insurance is unavailable or because premium costs are considered prohibitive 
a material loss not fully covered by insurance could have material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we maintain insurance at levels we believe to be customary in the industry to limit our financial exposure in the event of a substantial environmental claim resulting from sudden  unanticipated and accidental discharges of certain prohibited substances into the environment 
such insurance might not cover the complete amount of such a claim and would not cover fines or penalties for a violation of an environmental law 
office leases we occupy  square feet of office space at mckinney st  houston  texas   square feet of office space at leopard st  corpus christi  texas  square feet of office space at noel rd  dallas  texas  and  square feet of office at hwy  huntsville  texas the total rental expense for was approximately million 
employees zaza had full time employees  none of whom are represented by unions or are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
to date  zaza has not experienced any strikes or work stoppages due to labor problems  and believes that it has good relations with its employees 
in addition  zaza directly engages approximately independent contractors 
seasonal nature of business generally  but not always  the demand for gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months 
seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or abnormally hot summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation 
in addition  certain gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer 
this can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations 
seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit drilling and production activities and other oil and gas operations in certain areas 
these seasonal anomalies can increase competition for equipment  supplies and personnel

risk factors risks related to our company our independent registered public accounting firm expressed substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern in their audit opinion for our december  financial statements 
our audited financial statements for the year ended december  have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern 
our independent registered public accounting firm has issued their report dated april   in connection with the audit of our financial statements for the year ended december  that included an explanatory paragraph describing the existence of conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to our liquidity 
the fact that we have received this going concern qualification from our independent registered public accounting firm will likely make it more difficult for us to raise capital on favorable terms and could hinder  to some extent  our operations 
additionally  if we are not able to continue as a going concern  it is possible stockholders may lose part or all of their investment 
our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
our development and exploration operations require substantial capital and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all  which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil and gas reserves 
the oil and gas exploration and development industry is capital intensive 
we expect to continue making substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the purpose of exploration  development  production and acquisition of  oil and gas reserves 
historically  we financed capital expenditures in part from contributions  bonus payments and cost reimbursements by hess under our joint venture with them 
as a result of the termination of our joint venture with hess in  we have sold assets and incurred indebtedness in order to provide capital to carry out our activities 
to maintain our oil and gas leases and pursue our planned drilling program  we will need to raise additional capital 
our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables that may or may not be within our control  including the level of oil and gas we are able to produce from existing wells  the prices at which our oil and gas production is sold  the results of our development programs associated with proved and unproved reserves  our ability to acquire  locate and produce new economically recoverable reserves  global credit and securities markets  and the ability and willingness of lenders and investors to provide capital and the cost of that capital 
we will need to raise capital to maintain our oil and gas leases and finance our drilling operations 
we intend to pursue various strategies to raise capital  including asset sales  debt or equity financing  and joint ventures 
however  our existing indebtedness contains covenants that restrict our ability to pursue these strategies 
if we are unable to sell assets or if financing and joint venture partnerships are not available on acceptable terms or at all  we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels or to implement our strategy  including executing on our portfolio of drilling opportunities or expanding our existing portfolio 
there can be no assurance as to our ability to sell assets or as to the availability or terms of any joint ventures or other financing 
the failure to obtain additional capital could result in an inability to implement our strategy to pursue our drilling program and a curtailment of our operations relating to exploration and development of our prospects  which in turn could lead to possible write downs in the carrying value of our properties  a material decline in our oil and gas reserves as well as our revenues and results of operations 
the failure to obtain additional capital could also materially adversely affect our operations and prospects  including potentially resulting in the reversion of certain portions of our acreage to the lessors 
if we are unable to find a joint venture partner or partners in the eagle ford to finance development costs or to complete the joint development of our eaglebine acreage with eog resources  we may need to find alternative sources of capital  which may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
we are currently planning to have discussions with potential joint venture partners to develop our properties in the eagle ford trend  evaluating asset sale options for our properties in the eagle ford trend  and have recently entered into a joint development arrangement with eog resources for certain of our eaglebine acreage 
zaza holds approximately  net acres in the eaglebine before giving effect to any transfers of interests therein to eog resources  and approximately  net acres in the eagle ford before giving effect to our sale of our moulton properties 
there can be no assurances that we will identify a joint venture partner or partners for our eagle ford acreage or that such partner s will provide funding on acceptable terms to develop the existing properties or acquire new properties 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to sell assets in the eagle ford trend at valuations we deem acceptable 
there can also be no assurances that eog resources will elect to proceed with subsequent phases of the joint development of our eaglebine acreage 
if we cannot identify a joint venture partner or partners for our eagle ford acreage  sell assets at acceptable valuations or are unable to complete the joint development of our eaglebine acreage  we will need to utilize cash flow from other operations or will need to find alternative sources of capital to finance operations  which may slow the development of our properties and have a material adverse effect on our operations and prospects 
joint venture agreements that we may enter into could present a number of challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are seeking joint venture partners to develop our properties in the eagle ford trend and have recently entered into a joint development arrangement with eog resources for certain of our eaglebine acreage 
joint venture and joint development arrangements typically present financial  managerial and operational challenges  including potential disputes  liabilities or contingencies and may involve risks not otherwise present when exploring and developing properties directly  including  for example the joint venture partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions  including the acquisition of oil and gas properties  the joint venture partners may not pay their share of the joint venture s obligations  potentially leaving us liable for their share of such obligations  the joint venture partners may have options to assume the operation of the properties acquired by the joint venture  the joint venture partners may terminate the agreements under certain circumstances  we may incur liabilities or losses as a result of an action taken by the joint venture partners  and disputes between us and the joint venture partners may result in delays  litigation or operational impasses 
the risks described above or the failure to continue any joint venture or joint development arrangement or to resolve disagreements with the joint venture partners could materially adversely affect our ability to transact the business that is the subject of such joint venture  which would in turn negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our indebtedness and near term obligations could materially adversely affect our financial health  limit our ability to finance capital expenditures and future acquisitions and prevent us from executing our business strategy 
we have approximately million outstanding in aggregate principal under our senior secured notes due the senior secured notes and million outstanding in aggregate principal under our convertible senior notes due the convertible notes and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future 
in addition  we have approximately million outstanding in aggregate principal amount under our subordinated notes 
our level of indebtedness has  or could have  important consequences to our business  because a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations will have to be dedicated to interest and principal payments and may not be available for operations  working capital  capital expenditures  expansion  acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes  it may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for acquisitions  capital expenditures or general corporate purposes  it may limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry  and we may be substantially more leveraged than some of our competitors  which may place us at a relative competitive disadvantage and make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business  our industry or the economy in general 
in addition  the terms of our senior secured notes and our convertible notes restrict  and the terms of any future indebtedness  including any future credit facility  may restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and grant liens because of debt or financial covenants we are  or may be  required to meet 
thus  we may not be able to obtain sufficient capital to grow our business or implement our business strategy and may lose opportunities to acquire interests in oil properties or related businesses because of our inability to fund such growth 
our ability to comply with restrictions and covenants  including those in our senior secured notes  convertible notes or in any future debt agreement  is uncertain and will be affected by the levels of cash flow from our operations and events or circumstances beyond our control 
our senior secured notes also contain restrictions on the operation of our business  such as limitations on the sale and acquisition of assets  limitations on entering into joint ventures  limitations on restricted payments  limitations on mergers and consolidations  limitations on loans and investments  and limitations on the lines of business in which we may engage  which may limit our activities 
our convertible notes contain certain of the foregoing restrictions as well 
we must obtain consent from the holders of a majority of the senior secured notes for all transactions involving oil and gas properties  with certain carveouts and requirements to apply a portion of net sales proceeds to pay down the senior secured notes and with certain carveouts to enter into our joint venture with eog and to sell our moulton acreage 
thus  we may not be able to manage our cash flow in a manner that maximizes our business opportunities 
our failure to comply with any of the restrictions and covenants could result in a default  which could permit the holders of our senior secured notes and our convertible notes to accelerate repayments and foreclose on the collateral securing the indebtedness 
we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to purchase the senior secured notes and the convertible notes upon a fundamental change  and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to purchase the senior secured notes and the convertible notes 
holders of the senior secured notes and the convertible notes will have the right to require us to purchase the notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at and  respectively  of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
however  we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make purchases of tendered senior secured notes and convertible notes 
in addition  our ability to purchase the senior secured notes and convertible notes may be limited by law  by regulatory authority or by the agreements governing our then current and future indebtedness 
our failure to purchase tendered senior secured notes and convertible notes at a time when the purchase is required by the terms of the senior secured notes or convertible notes would constitute a default under those notes 
a default under those notes or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default or require a prepayment under  or result in the acceleration of the maturity or purchase of  our existing or future other indebtedness 
the requirement that we offer to purchase the senior secured notes and convertible notes upon a fundamental change is limited to the transactions specified in the definition of a fundamental change  which definition may differ from the definition of a fundamental change or change of control in the agreements governing our existing or future other indebtedness 
if the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods  we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and purchase the senior secured notes and the convertible notes 
if we do not satisfy our drilling obligations under our agreement with range  we could lose a portion of our acreage and revenue stream in the eaglebine  which could adversely affect our expected revenues 
on march   the company entered into a participation agreement the range agreement  and associated joint operating agreement  with range texas production  llc range  a subsidiary of range resources corporation  under which the company agreed to acquire a working interest from range in certain leases located in grimes country  texas the leases 
pursuant to the terms of the range agreement  range retained a working interest in the leases and the company committed to drill a well the commitment well 
the company recently ceased completion operations at the commitment well  and effective january   the company and range entered into an amendment no 
to the range agreement the amendment 
under the terms of the amendment  if the company fails to commence re completion operations at the commitment well the re entry well in a bona fide attempt to complete the re entry well as a vertical well within days of january  the company has timely commenced such operations or fails to commence drilling of a substitute well for the commitment well within days of january   the company will be required to assign a working interest in the leases to range  resulting in the company retaining a working interest in the leases  and transfer operatorship in the leases to range 
if the company fails to meet either of these deadlines  the foregoing remedies will have an impact on our expected revenues in the eaglebine 
our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be limited or such net operating loss carryforwards may expire before utilization 
as of december   we had us federal tax net operating loss carryforwards nols of approximately million  which expire at various dates from fiscal year through fiscal year these net operating loss carryforwards  subject to certain requirements and restrictions  including limitations on their use as a result of an ownership change  may be used to offset future taxable income and thereby reduce our us federal income taxes otherwise payable 
we are required to evaluate the likelihood of utilizing the nols according to a more likely than not standard in accordance with gaap and  if as a result of such evaluation we determine we may not be able to meet such standard  we may be required to recognize a valuation allowance for this deferred tax asset 
the recognition of a valuation allowance would reduce earnings and would also result in a corresponding reduction of stockholders equity 
recognition of a valuation allowance is a non cash charge to earnings and it does not preclude us from using the nols to reduce future taxable income otherwise payable 
section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  imposes an annual limit on the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to use its net operating loss carry forwards to reduce its tax liability 
the amount of taxable income in each tax year after the ownership change that may be offset by pre change nols and certain other pre change tax attributes is generally equal to the product of a the fair market value of the corporation s outstanding stock immediately prior to the ownership change and b the long term tax exempt rate ie  a rate of interest established by the internal revenue service that fluctuates from month to month 
an ownership change would occur if stockholders  deemed under section to own or more of our capital stock by value  increase their collective ownership of the aggregate amount of our capital stock to more than percentage points over a defined period of time 
in the event of certain changes in our stockholder base  we may at some point in the future experience an ownership change as defined in section of the code 
accordingly  our use of the net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards may be limited at some point in the future by the annual limitations described in sections and of the code 
we have disclosed a material weakness in our internal disclosure controls and procedures which could erode investor confidence  jeopardize our ability to obtain insurance  and limit our ability to attract qualified persons to serve at zaza 
as of december   an evaluation was conducted by zaza management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  as to the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to rules a e and d e of the exchange act 
based on that evaluation  our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of december  because of material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting resulting from the write off of exploration costs associated with a failed lateral portion of an exploratory well  and an error in the calculation of certain deferred income tax losses 
our management believes that this error was a result of the failure of coordination between our personnel that make our determinations of well outcomes and our personnel that prepare our financial statements 
this evaluation is more fully described elsewhere in this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  failure to comply with rules regarding internal controls and procedures may make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance  including director and officer liability insurance 
we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage and or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors  on committees of our board of directors  or as executive officers 
our management identified an error in the calculation of certain deferred tax liabilities for the period ended march  this error was corrected prior to our filing of the financial statements for such period with the sec 
accordingly  management believes that the financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented 
notwithstanding the correct presentation in our financial statements  our management believes that this error was a result of the failure of coordination between our personnel that calculate our tax liabilities and our personnel that prepare the financial statements 
management is reviewing remediation steps necessary to address the material weaknesses and to improve our internal control over financial reporting 
we intend to correct the material weaknesses promptly 
title to the properties in which zaza has an interest may be impaired by title defects 
zaza generally obtains title opinions on significant properties that it drills or acquires 
additionally  undeveloped acreage has greater risk of title defects than developed acreage 
generally  under the terms of the operating agreements affecting its properties  any monetary loss is to be borne by all parties to any such agreement in proportion to their interests in such property 
if there are any title defects or defects in assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which zaza holds an interest  we could suffer a material financial loss 
the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment  raw materials  supplies  personnel and oil field services could materially adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within its budget 
our industry is cyclical and  from time to time  there is a shortage of drilling rigs  equipment  raw materials particularly sand  cement and other proppants  supplies or qualified personnel 
during these periods  the costs and delivery times of rigs  equipment  raw materials and supplies are substantially greater 
in addition  the demand for  and wage rates of  qualified drilling rig crews rise as the number of active rigs in service increases 
if oil and gas prices increase in the future  increasing levels of exploration  development and production could result in response to these stronger prices  and as a result  the demand and the costs of oilfield services  drilling rigs  raw materials  supplies and equipment could increase  while the quality of these services and supplies may suffer 
in addition  our exploration  development and production operations also require local access to large quantities of water supplies and disposal services for produced water in connection with our hydraulic fracture stimulations due to prohibitive transportation costs 
existing shortages of drilling rig service providers for pressure pumping and other services required for well completion in the eagle ford shale have delayed our development and production operations and caused us to incur additional expenditures that were in excess of those provided for in its capital budget 
we cannot determine the magnitude or length of these shortages or future shortages or price increases  which could have a material adverse effect on its business  cash flows  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  shortages and price increases could restrict our ability to drill wells and conduct ordinary operations 
drilling for and producing oil and gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our success will depend on the results of our exploration  development and production activities 
oil and gas exploration  development and production activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control  including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil or gas production 
decisions to purchase  explore  develop or otherwise exploit prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses  production data  and engineering studies  the results of which are often inconclusive or inaccurate or subject to varying interpretations or uncertainty 
costs of drilling  completing and operating wells are often uncertain before drilling commences 
overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomical 
furthermore  many factors may curtail  delay or cancel drilling  and such work stoppage may not be covered by our insurance  including shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel  pressure or irregularities in geological formations  equipment failures or accidents  the joint venture partners may not pay their share of the joint venture s obligations  potentially leaving us liable for their share of such obligations  the joint venture partners may have options to assume the operation of the properties acquired by the joint venture  the joint venture partners may terminate the agreements under certain circumstances  we may incur liabilities or losses as a result of an action taken by the joint venture partners  and disputes between us and the joint venture partners may result in delays  litigation or operational impasses 
the risks described above or the failure to continue any joint venture or to resolve disagreements with the joint venture partners could materially adversely affect our ability to transact the business that is the subject of such joint venture  which would in turn negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 
numerous uncertainties will be inherent in our estimates of oil and gas reserves and estimated reserve quantities  and the present value calculations presented in the future relating to such reserves may not be accurate 
any material inaccuracies in reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will affect materially the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and cash flows attributable to such reserves  including factors beyond our engineers control or the third party preparing the reserve report 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of an estimate of quantities of reserves  or of cash flows attributable to such reserves  is a function of the available data  assumptions regarding future oil and gas prices  expenditures for future development and exploration activities  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
in addition  accurately estimating reserves in shale formations such as ours can be even more difficult than estimating reserves in more traditional hydrocarbon bearing formations given the complexities of the projected decline curves and economics of shale gas wells 
additionally  probable and possible reserve estimates are estimates of unproved reserves and may be misunderstood or seen as misleading to investors that are not experts in the oil or natural gas industry 
as such  investors should not place undue reliance on these estimates 
reserves and future cash flows may be subject to material downward or upward revisions  based upon production history  development and exploration activities and prices of oil and gas 
in addition  different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same available data 
the present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves referred to in any reserve report will not necessarily be the actual current market value of our estimated oil and gas reserves at such time 
in accordance with sec requirements  we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from its proved reserves using the un weighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month for each month within a twelve month period 
unless we replace our reserves  our reserves and production will decline  which would adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
producing oil and gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors 
decline rates are typically greatest early in the productive life of a well 
estimates of the decline rate of an oil or gas wells  and those in shale formations  in particular are inherently imprecise  and are less precise with respect to new or emerging oil and gas formations with limited production histories than for more developed formations with established production histories 
our production levels and the reserves that we may recover from our wells will change if production from our existing wells declines in a different manner than we have estimated 
thus  our future oil and gas reserves and production and  therefore  our future cash flow and results of operations  are highly dependent upon our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current properties and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves 
we may not be able to develop  find or acquire additional reserves or future production at acceptable costs 
if we are unable to replace our current or future production  our cash flows and the value of our reserves may decrease  and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are concentrated in one geographic area  which increases our exposure to many of the risks enumerated herein 
currently  zaza s operations are highly concentrated in the eagle ford shale and the eaglebine 
this concentration increases the potential impact that many of the risks stated herein may have upon our ability to perform 
for example  we have greater exposure to regulatory actions impacting texas  natural disasters in the geographic area  competition for equipment  services and materials available in the area and access to infrastructure and markets 
we have historically depended on a few customers and a loss of any customer or a decrease in demand would adversely affect our business and operating results 
our customer base has been highly concentrated 
gulfmark is the primary purchaser of the company s crude oil  and texla is our primary purchaser of natural gas 
we expect that revenue from a small number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
hedging activities may require us to make significant payments that are not offset by sales of production and may prevent us from benefiting from increases in oil prices 
zaza has not historically entered into hedging transactions 
however  we may in the future enter into various hedging transactions for a portion of our production in an attempt to reduce our exposure to the volatility of oil prices 
in a typical hedge transaction  we will have the right to receive from the counterparty to the hedge the excess of the fixed price specified in the hedge over a floating price based on a market index  multiplied by the quantity hedged 
if the floating price exceeds the fixed price  we will be required to pay the counterparty this difference multiplied by the quantity hedged 
in such case  we will be required to pay the difference regardless of whether we have sufficient production to cover the quantities specified in the hedge 
significant reductions in production at times when the floating price exceeds the fixed price could require us to make payments under the hedge agreements even though such payments are not offset by sales of production 
hedging also could prevent us from receiving the full advantage of increases in oil prices above the fixed amount specified in the hedge 
we may not be able to obtain access to pipelines  gas gathering  transmission  storage and processing facilities to market our oil and gas production and our ability to sell our production and or receive market prices for our production may be materially adversely affected by transportation capacity constraints and interruptions 
the marketing of oil and gas production depends in large part on the availability  proximity and capacity of pipelines and storage facilities  gas gathering systems and other transportation  processing and refining facilities  as well as the existence of adequate markets 
if there were insufficient capacity available on these systems  or if these systems were unavailable to us  the price offered for our production could be significantly depressed  or we could be forced to shut in some production or delay or discontinue drilling plans and commercial production following a discovery of hydrocarbons while it constructs its own facility 
we also rely and expect to rely in the future on facilities developed and owned by third parties in order to store  process  transmit and sell our oil and gas production 
our plans to develop our oil and gas reserves could be materially and adversely affected by the inability or unwillingness of third parties to provide sufficient transmission  storage or processing facilities to us  especially in areas of planned expansion where such facilities do not currently exist 
if the amount of oil  gas or condensate being produced by us and others exceeds the capacity of the various transportation pipelines and gathering systems currently available in our operating areas  it will be necessary for new transportation pipelines and gathering systems to be built 
or  in the case of oil and condensate  it will be necessary for us to rely more heavily on trucks to transport our production  which is more expensive and less efficient than transportation by pipeline 
the construction of new pipelines and gathering systems is capital intensive and construction may be postponed  interrupted or cancelled in response to changing economic conditions and the availability and cost of capital 
in addition  capital constraints could limit our ability to build gathering systems to transport our production to transportation pipelines 
in such event  costs to transport our production may increase materially or we might have to shut in its wells awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity and or sell its production at much lower prices than market or than we currently project  which would materially adversely affect our results of operation 
a portion of our production may also be interrupted  or shut in  from time to time for numerous other reasons  including as a result of weather conditions  loss of pipeline or gathering system access  field labor issues or strikes  or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions 
if a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time  it could materially adversely affect our cash flow 
our identified drilling location inventories are scheduled out over several years  making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling 
our management has specifically identified and scheduled drilling locations as an estimation of its future multi year drilling activities on its existing acreage 
these identified drilling locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy 
our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of factors  including the availability of capital  seasonal conditions  regulatory approvals  oil and gas prices  negotiation of agreements with third parties  costs  access to and availability of equipment  services and personnel and drilling results 
because of these uncertainties  we cannot give any assurance as to the timing of these activities  if the potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if it will be able to economically produce oil or gas from these or any other potential drilling locations 
as such  our actual drilling activities may materially differ from our current expectations  which could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
competition in the oil and gas industry is intense  and many of our competitors have resources that are greater than ours 
we operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring prospects and productive properties  marketing oil and gas and securing equipment and trained personnel 
our competitors include major and large independent oil and gas companies that possess financial  technical and personnel resources substantially greater than our resources 
those companies may be able to develop and acquire more prospects and productive properties at a lower cost and more quickly than our financial or personnel resources permit 
our ability to acquire additional prospects and discover reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment 
larger competitors may be better able to withstand sustained periods of unsuccessful drilling and absorb the burden of changes in laws and regulations more easily than we can  which could materially adversely affect our competitive position 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves  developing reserves  marketing hydrocarbons  attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital 
a failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  cash flows and future growth 
our success is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain personnel with the technical expertise  specialized knowledge and training  skills and experience required for our business 
an inability to sufficiently staff our operations or the loss of the services of one or more members of our senior management or of numerous employees with technical skills could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  cash flows and future growth 
while we have entered into employment arrangements with certain of our senior executives  and while a number of consultants have consulting agreements with us  there can be no assurances that any of them will remain with us 
shortage and competition in hydraulic fracturing services could impede our ability to develop our shale plays 
the unavailability or high cost of high pressure pumping services or hydraulic fracturing services  chemicals  proppant  water  and related services and equipment could limit our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within its budget 
our industry is experiencing a growing emphasis on the exploitation and development of shale gas and shale oil resource plays  which are dependent on hydraulic fracturing for economically successful development 
hydraulic fracturing in shale plays requires high pressure pumping service crews 
a shortage of service crews or proppant  chemical  or water  especially if this shortage occurred in south texas  could materially and adversely affect our operations and the timeliness of executing our development plans within our budget 
zaza does not own all of the land on which its transportation pipelines and gathering and treating systems are located  which could materially disrupt its operations 
zaza does not own all of the land on which its gathering and treating systems have been constructed  and we are therefore subject to the possibility of increased costs to retain necessary land use 
zaza obtains the rights to construct and operate our gathering and treating systems on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time 
our loss of these rights  through our inability to renew right of way contracts or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our property acquisition strategy could fail or present unanticipated problems for our business in the future  which could materially adversely affect our ability to make property acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits of those acquisitions 
our growth strategy includes acquiring oil and gas properties depending on the availability of capital 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or finance and complete any particular acquisition successfully 
furthermore  acquisitions involve a number of risks and challenges  including diversion of management s attention  ability or impediments to conducting thorough due diligence activities  an increase in our expenses and working capital requirements  the validity of our assumptions about reserves  future production  revenues  capital expenditures  and operating costs  including synergies  a decrease in our liquidity by using a significant portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity  if any  to finance acquisitions  a significant increase in interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance acquisitions  the assumption of unknown liabilities  losses  or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which indemnity is inadequate  and the incurrence of other significant charges  such as impairment of oil and gas properties  asset devaluation  or restructuring charges 
our decision to acquire a property will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained from production reports and engineering studies  geophysical and geological analyses  and seismic and other information  the results of which are often inconclusive and subject to various interpretations 
also  our reviews of acquired properties are inherently incomplete because it generally is not feasible to perform an in depth review of the individual properties involved in each acquisition given time constraints imposed by sellers 
even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems  nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully access their deficiencies and potential 
inspections may not always be performed on every well  and environmental problems  such as groundwater contamination  are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken 
we face risks associated with hurricanes and other natural disasters in connection with our operations near coastal areas in texas 
a portion of our oil and gas properties are located near coastal areas of the texas gulf coast 
as a result  in the event of damage due to hurricanes  tropical storms  flooding or similar natural disasters  we could be subject to production curtailments in the future resulting from hurricane damage to certain fields or  even in the event that producing fields are not damaged  production could be curtailed due to damage to facilities and equipment owned by oil and gas purchasers  or vendors and suppliers 
access to water to conduct hydraulic fracturing may not be available if water sources become scarce 
the availability of sources of water is crucial to conduct hydraulic fracturing 
approximately  gallons of water are necessary for drilling and completing one well in the eagle ford shale and in the eaglebine 
texas is currently experiencing a severe drought that has limited the water supplies that are necessary to conduct hydraulic fracturing 
we have been sourcing our water from deeper aquifers that have not yet been impacted by the drought 
we can make no assurances that sufficient water resources will be available in the short or long term to carry out our current activities 
risks related to our industry volatile oil and gas prices could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our most significant market risk is the pricing of oil and gas 
management expects energy prices to remain volatile and unpredictable 
moreover  oil and gas prices depend on factors that are outside of our control  including actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries and state controlled oil companies relating to oil prices and production controls  impact of energy conservation efforts  consumer demand  domestic and foreign governmental regulations  actions and taxes  refining capacity  seasonal variations in oil and gas prices  economic and energy infrastructure disruptions caused by actual or threatened acts of war  or terrorist activities  weather conditions  such as hurricanes  including energy infrastructure disruptions resulting from those conditions and natural disasters  changes in the global oil and gas supply  demand and inventories  changes in domestic gas supply  demand and inventories  the price and quantity of foreign imports of oil and gas  the price and availability of liquefied gas imports  political conditions in or affecting other oil producing and gas producing countries  including the current conflicts in the middle east and north africa  general economic conditions in the united stated and worldwide  the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration and production activity  technological advances affecting energy production and consumption  and the price and availability of alternative fuels 
further  oil and gas prices do not necessarily fluctuate in direct relation to each other 
lower oil and gas prices not only decrease revenues on a per unit basis  but also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can economically produce 
lower prices could also negatively impact estimates of our proved reserves 
our revenues  profitability and cash flow depend upon the price of and demand for oil and gas  and a drop in prices can significantly affect our financial results and impede our growth 
if oil and gas prices decrease or exploration efforts are unsuccessful  we may be required to write down the capitalized cost of individual oil and gas properties 
a write down of the capitalized cost of individual oil and gas properties could occur when oil and gas prices are low or if we have substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved oil and gas reserves  if operating costs or development costs increase over prior estimates  or if exploratory drilling is unsuccessful 
we use the successful efforts accounting method 
all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred  pending the determination of whether proved reserves are discovered 
if proved reserves are not discovered with an exploratory well  the costs of drilling the well are expensed 
all geological and geophysical costs on exploratory prospects are expensed as incurred 
the capitalized costs of our proved oil and gas properties  on a field by field basis  may exceed the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of that field 
if so  we will adjust the carrying value of the field to its fair value in the current period 
the factors used to determine fair value include  but are not limited to  estimates of reserves  future commodity prices  future production estimates  anticipated capital expenditures  and a discount rate commensurate with the risk associated with realizing the expected cash flows projected 
unproved properties are reviewed to determine if there has been an impairment of the carrying value  with any such impairment charged to expense 
given the complexities associated with oil and gas reserves estimates and the history of price volatility in the oil and gas market  events may arise that will require us to record an impairment of our oil and gas properties and there can be no assurance that such impairments will not be required in the future nor that they will not be material 
we may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our oil and gas operations 
oil and gas exploration  drilling and production activities are subject to numerous operating risks  including the possibility of blowouts  fires and explosions  personal injuries and death  uninsured or underinsured losses  unanticipated  abnormally pressured formations  uncontrollable flows of oil  gas or well fluids  mechanical difficulties  such as stuck oil field drilling and service tools and casing collapses  and environmental hazards  such as uncontrollable flows of oil  gas  brine  well fluids  toxic gas or other pollution into the environment  including groundwater contamination 
any of these operating hazards could cause damage to properties  serious injuries  fatalities  oil spills  discharge of hazardous materials  remediation and clean up costs  and other environmental damages  which could expose us to liabilities 
the payment of any of these liabilities could reduce  or even eliminate  the funds available for exploration  development  and acquisition or could result in a loss of our properties 
we are not fully insured against all risks  including development and completion risks that are generally not recoverable from third parties or insurance 
in addition  our insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to sudden and accidental pollution  but not for other types of pollution 
our insurance might be inadequate to cover our liabilities 
our energy package is written on reasonably standard terms and conditions that are generally available to the exploration and production industry 
the insurance market in general and the energy insurance market in particular have been difficult markets over the past several years 
insurance costs could increase in the future as the insurance industry adjusts to difficult exposures and we may decrease coverage and retain more risk to mitigate future cost increases 
if we incur substantial liability and the damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits  or if we incur a liability for a risk at a time when we do not have liability insurance  then our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
we are subject to regulations that are evolving and may cause us to incur substantial costs 
our activities are subject to federal  state  regional and local laws and regulations 
extensive laws  regulations and rules regulate activities and operations in the oil and gas industry 
for example  matters subject to regulation and the types of permits required include drilling permits  water discharge and disposal permits for drilling operations  the amounts and types of substances and materials that may be released into the environment  drilling and operating bonds  environmental matters and reclamation  spacing of wells  the use of underground injection wells  which affects the disposal of water from its wells  occupational safety and health  unitization and pooling of properties  air quality  noise levels and related permits  rights of way and easements  reports concerning operations to regulatory authorities  calculation and payment of royalties  gathering  transportation and marketing of oil and gas  taxation  and waste disposal 
under these laws and regulations  we could be liable for personal injuries  property damage  oil spills  discharge or disposal of hazardous materials  well reclamation costs  surface remediation and clean up costs  fines and penalties  natural resource damages  and other environmental protection and damages issues 
environmental and other governmental laws and regulations also increase the costs to plan  permit  design  drill  install  operate and abandon oil and gas wells 
a major risk inherent in our drilling plans is the need to obtain drilling permits from applicable federal  state and local authorities 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals or drilling permits for producing and water injection wells  the failure to obtain a drilling permit for a well  or the receipt of a permit with excessive conditions or costs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to explore or develop its properties 
additionally  the oil and gas regulatory environment could change in ways that might substantially increase the financial and managerial costs to comply with the requirements of these laws and regulations and  consequently  adversely affect our profitability 
furthermore  we may be put at a competitive disadvantage to larger companies in our industry that can spread these additional costs over a greater number of wells and larger operating area 
any or all of these contingencies could delay or halt our drilling activities or the construction of ancillary facilities necessary for production  which would prevent us from developing its property interests as planned 
conditions  delays or restrictions imposed on the management of groundwater produced during drilling could severely limit our operations or make them uneconomic 
changes in laws and regulations could affect our costs of operations  production levels  royalty obligations  price levels  environmental requirements  and other aspects of our business  including our general profitability 
we are unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations 
for example  the us environmental protection agency  or the epa  has recently focused on public concerns about the risk of water contamination and public health problems from drilling and hydraulic fracturing activities 
this renewed focus could lead to additional federal and state regulations affecting the oil and gas industry 
there can be no assurance that present or future regulations will not materially adversely affect our business and operations  including that we may be required to suspend drilling operations or shut in production pending compliance 
additional regulations or other changes to or reinterpretations of existing laws and regulations could significantly impact our business  results of operations  cash flows  financial position and future growth 
environmental matters and costs can be significant 
our oil and gas exploration and production operations are subject to stringent and complex federal  state and local laws and regulations governing health and safety aspects of our operations  the discharge of materials into the environment  the generation  storage  transportation and handling of hazardous materials or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
these laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations that are applicable to our operations including the acquisition of a permit before conducting drilling or underground injection activities  the restriction of types  quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment  the limitation or prohibition of drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness  wetlands and other protected areas  the application of specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection  and the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations 
numerous governmental authorities  such as the epa and analogous state agencies  have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them  oftentimes requiring difficult and costly actions 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions  including administrative  civil or criminal penalties  the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations  and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations 
there is inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in the performance of our operations due to our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes  because of air emissions and wastewater discharges related to its operations  and as a result of historical industry operations and waste disposal practices 
the exploration and production of oil and gas involves many risks concerning equipment and human operational problems that could lead to leaks or spills of petroleum products 
under certain environmental laws and regulations  we could be subject to strict  joint and several liability for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or contamination or whether the operations were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken 
private parties  including the owners of properties upon which our wells are drilled and facilities where zaza s petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal  also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property or natural resource damages 
contamination of groundwater by oil and gas drilling  production and related operations may result in fines  penalties  and remediation costs 
in addition  the risk of accidental spills or releases could expose us to significant liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently  and any changes that result in more stringent or costly waste control  handling  storage  transport  disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on its own results of operations  competitive position or financial condition 
possible legislation and regulations related to global warming and climate change could have a material adverse effect on our operations and the demand for oil and gas 
in december  the epa determined that emissions of carbon dioxide  methane  and other greenhouse gases  or ghgs  present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gasses are contributing to the warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes 
based on these findings  the epa recently adopted regulations under existing provisions of the clean air act that require a reduction in emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles and that regulate emissions of ghgs from certain large stationary sources  effective january  the epa has published its final rule to address the permitting of ghg emissions from stationary sources under the prevention of significant deterioration  or psd  and title v permitting programs  pursuant to which these permitting programs have been tailored to apply to certain stationary sources of ghg emissions in a multi step process  with the largest sources subject to permitting first 
facilities required to obtain psd permits for their ghg emissions also will be required to meet best available control technology standards  which will be established by the states or  in some instances  by the epa on a case by case basis 
although our current operations do not require psd or title v air permits and are not affected by the tailoring rule  the rule may affect us in the future as its operations grow 
such epa rulemakings could materially adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified facilities 
as a result of these regulatory initiatives  our operating costs may increase in compliance with these programs 
the epa has also adopted regulations requiring the reporting of ghg emissions from specified large ghg emission sources in the united states including certain onshore and offshore oil and gas production facilities  which may include certain of our operations  beginning in for emissions occurring in in addition  congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs and almost one half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of ghgs primarily through the planned development of ghg emission inventories and or regional ghg cap and trade programs 
most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring either major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances  with the number of allowances available for purchase reduced each year until the overall ghg emission reduction goal is achieved 
these allowances would be expected to escalate significantly in cost over time 
the adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of ghgs could require us to incur increased operating costs  such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems  to acquire emissions allowances or to comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements 
any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming  and thereby reduce demand for  the oil and gas we produce 
consequently  legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of ghgs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
finally  some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earth s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects  such as increased frequency and severity of storms  floods and other climatic events 
if any such effects were to occur  they could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays and inability to book future reserves 
hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water  sand and additives under pressure into rock formations to stimulate hydrocarbon oil and gas production 
we engage third parties to provide hydraulic fracturing or other well stimulation services to us in connection with several wells or proposed wells for which we are the operator 
we find that the use of hydraulic fracturing is necessary to produce commercial quantities of oil and gas from many reservoirs where we have significant acreage 
the process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions 
however  congress has considered bills which  if enacted  would repeal an exemption in the federal sdwa for the underground injection of hydraulic fracturing fluids near drinking water sources and could result in additional regulatory burdens  such as permitting  construction  financial assurance  monitoring  recordkeeping and plugging and abandonment requirements 
in addition  several states  including texas  have adopted rules requiring the reporting and public disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process 
the availability of this information could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater 
hydraulic fracturing impacts and practices have also been the subject of a number of governmental and private studies 
the epa is conducting an investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices 
on november   the epa released its study plan on the effects of hydraulic fracturing on human health and the environment to the epa s science advisory board for comment 
the epa issued an update on the study on december  and expects to issue the final report in on april   the department of interior  the department of energy and the environmental protection agency issued a memorandum outlining the multi agency collaboration on unconventional oil and gas research in response to the white house blueprint for a secure energy future and the recommendation of the secretary of energy advisory board subcommittee on natural gas 
these ongoing and proposed studies could lead to initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing 
additional requirements could be imposed  including permitting requirements  financial assurances  public disclosure obligations  monitoring and reporting requirements 
new requirements could increase operating costs and any disclosure requirements could increase the possibility of third party or governmental legal challenges to hydraulic fracturing 
the epa has also begun to assert regulatory authority over certain aspects of hydraulic fracturing 
recently  the epa asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives under the sdwa s underground injection control program  or the uic  and is currently developing uic permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing activities that use diesel fuel in fracturing fluids 
in addition  the epa has issued new emission standards to reduce voc emissions from oil and gas exploration and production operations including specific limitations for emissions associated with hydraulic fracturing 
in particular  hydraulically fractured gas wells must comply with reduced emission rec techniques by january  further  the agency has announced that one of its enforcement initiatives for its to fiscal years would be to focus on environmental compliance by the energy extraction sector 
finally  on october   the epa announced its plan to propose pretreatment standards for wastewater generated during the hydraulic fracturing process 
these governmental studies of hydraulic fracturing impacts and practices and the epa s regulatory and enforcement initiatives could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business 
if hydraulic fracturing becomes regulated at the federal level as a result of federal legislation or regulatory initiatives by the epa  our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs 
if such permitting requirements delay our drilling activity  our ability to present reserves  and once presented  book reserves  will be delayed as well 
in addition  some states have adopted  and other states are considering adopting  regulations that could impose more stringent permitting  disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations 
for example  pennsylvania  colorado  and wyoming have each adopted a variety of well construction  set back  and disclosure regulations limiting how fracturing can be performed and requiring various degrees of chemical disclosure 
texas recently passed a law requiring public disclosure of certain information about chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process  and the texas railroad commission has adopted rules setting forth requirements for such public disclosure 
in addition  the texas commission on environmental quality recently adopted more stringent air emission and permitting requirements for oil and gas exploration operations in the barnett shale 
more stringent air emissions and permitting requirements may be imposed on the areas in which we operate sometime in the future 
these regulations  if adopted  would affect our operations  increase our costs of exploration and production and limit the quantity of oil and gas that we can economically produce 
a major risk inherent in our drilling plans is the need to obtain drilling permits from state and local authorities on a timely basis following leasing 
in addition to the imposition of more stringent regulations at the state and federal level  certain local authorities have passed or are considering moratoria on oil and gas drilling and restrictions on hydraulic fracturing 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals  drilling permits  the failure to obtain a drilling permit for a well or the receipt of a permit with unreasonable conditions or costs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to explore or develop its properties 
additionally  the oil and gas regulatory environment could change in ways that might substantially increase our financial and managerial costs to comply with the requirements of these laws and regulations and  consequently  materially adversely affect our profitability 
furthermore  these additional costs may put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to larger companies in the industry which can spread such additional costs over a greater number of wells and larger operating staff 
any increased costs for fracturing or restrictions on the use of fracturing could result in we being unable to economically produce hydrocarbons that we discover  resulting in our inability to book reserves  and materially adversely affecting its future results of operations 
global financial and economic circumstances may have impacts on our business and financial condition that we currently cannot predict 
global financial markets may have a material adverse impact on our business and its financial condition  and it may face challenges if conditions in the financial markets are inadequate to finance our activities at a reasonable cost of capital 
while the current economic situation has improved since  continuing concerns over the worldwide economic outlook  geopolitical issues  the availability and costs of credit  and the sovereign debt crisis have contributed to increased volatility in the global financial markets and commodity prices and diminished expectations for the global economy and these conditions could make it more difficult for us to access capital 
in addition  adverse economic circumstances could cause customers  joint owners or other parties with whom we transact business to fail to meet their obligations to us 
also  worldwide economic conditions could lead to reduced demand for oil and gas  or lower prices for oil and gas  or both  which could have a material negative impact on our revenues  results of operations and financial conditions 
certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation 
recently the president and certain members of congress have proposed changes in the tax code to eliminate certain us federal income tax deductions and credits currently available to oil and gas exploration and production companies 
such proposed changes include  but are not limited to  i the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties  ii the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs  iii the elimination of the deduction for certain us production activities  and iv an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures 
it is unclear  however  whether any such changes will be enacted or  if enacted  how soon such changes would be effective 
the passage of any legislation as a result of the budget proposal or any other similar change in us federal income tax law could eliminate or defer certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development  and any such change could negatively affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
laws regulating derivatives established under the dodd frank act and the regulations being promulgated thereunder could adversely affect our ability to manage business and financial risks by reducing the availability of  and increasing our cost of using  derivative instruments as hedges against fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates 
on july  new comprehensive financial reform legislation  known as the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  or the dodd frank act  was enacted that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over the counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market 
the dodd frank act requires the commodities futures trading commission  or cftc  federal regulators of banks and other financial institutions  or the prudential regulators  and the sec to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation 
we have not historically entered into hedging transactions 
if we choose to do so  we will be required to comply with certain clearing and trade execution requirements or to take steps to qualify for an exemption to such requirements that are set forth in the new legislation 
in addition  new regulations may require us to comply with margin requirements in connection with our entry into certain derivatives activities  although these regulations are not finalized and their application to us is uncertain at this time 
such a requirement may increase our costs and decrease our profitability 
moreover  our counterparties may also be required to post margin on our transactions and comply with minimum capital requirements  which could result in additional costs being passed on to us  thereby negatively affecting our business  results of operations and financial condition 
other regulations also remain to be finalized  and the cftc recently has delayed the compliance dates for various regulations already finalized 
as a result  it is not possible at this time to predict with certainty the full effects of the dodd frank act and cftc rules on us and the timing of such effects 
to the extent we do enter into derivatives transactions  the dodd frank act may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to separate entities  which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties 
the dodd frank act and regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts including from swap recordkeeping and reporting requirements and through requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity  materially alter the terms of derivative contracts  reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter  reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts  and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties 
if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the dodd frank act and regulations  our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable  which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures 
risks related to the ownership of our common stock we do not intend to pay cash dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable future 
we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future  but expect to retain earnings to finance the growth of our business 
therefore  any return on investments will only occur if the market price of our common stock appreciates 
in addition  the terms of our senior secured notes and warrants prohibit the payment of dividends 
an active public market for our common stock may not be sustained 
prior to the completion of the combination  no public market existed for the shares of zaza energy corporation common stock 
although our shares of common stock are listed on the nasdaq capital market  an active public market for our common stock may not be sustained  which could affect the ability to sell  or depress the market price of  our common stock 
we are unable to predict whether an active trading market for our common stock will be sustained 
the public price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile 
the price and volume of our common stock may be volatile and subject to fluctuations 
some of the factors that could cause fluctuations in the stock price or trading volume of our common stock include general market and economic conditions and market trends  including in the energy and oil industries and the financial markets generally  the political  economic and social situation in the united states  actual or expected variations in operating results  variations in quarterly operating results  inability to meet projections in production and revenue  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures  capital commitments  or other business developments  such as oil or gas discoveries  adoption of new accounting standards affecting the industry in which we operate  operations and stock performance of competitors  litigation or governmental action involving or affecting us or our subsidiaries  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts  recruitment or departure of key personnel  purchase or sales of blocks of our common stock  and operating and stock performance of the companies that investors may consider to be comparable 
there can be no assurance that the price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly 
the stock market in recent years has experienced considerable price and volume fluctuations that has often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies and that could materially adversely affect the price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
the market prices of stock in exploration stage companies have been especially volatile 
in addition  price volatility might be worse if the trading volume of shares of the common stock is low 
furthermore  stockholders may initiate securities class action lawsuits if the market price of zaza energy corporation s stock declines significantly  which may cause our to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management 
we have the ability to issue blank check preferred stock  which could affect the rights of holders of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation allows the board of directors to issue up to million shares of preferred stock and to set the terms of such preferred stock 
the terms of such preferred stock may materially adversely impact the dividend and liquidation rights of holders of our common stock 
the requirements of being a public company  including the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of  may strain our resources  increase our costs and distract management  and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost effective manner 
we have limited history operating as a publicly traded company 
we need to comply with certain laws and regulations and public reporting requirements  including the reporting obligations of the securities exchange act of  as amended  or the exchange act  certain corporate governance provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of  laws  and regulations and rules of the sec and the nasdaq 
complying with these statutes  regulations and requirements will increase our general and administrative costs as a result of higher expenses associated with director and officer liability insurance  audit work  regulatory requirements and the establishment and maintenance of heightened corporate governance measures and management oversight 
compliance will occupy a significant portion of our board of directors and management s time 
we are currently instituting a more comprehensive compliance function  designing  establishing  and evaluating a system of internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related rules and regulations of the sec and the public company accounting oversight board  establishing internal policies  such as those relating to disclosure controls and procedures and insider trading  preparing and filing periodic and annual reports  and establishing an investor relations function 
if we are unable to accomplish these objectives in a timely and effective fashion  our ability to comply with our public reporting requirements and other rules that apply to public companies could be impaired  and we may be subject to sanction or investigation by the sec or the nasdaq 
we are an emerging growth company  and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors 
we are an emerging growth company  as defined in the jobs act  and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies  including  but not limited to reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements  and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved 
in addition  even if we comply with the greater obligations of public companies that are not emerging growth companies immediately after this offering  we may avail ourselves of the reduced requirements applicable to emerging growth companies from time to time in the future  so long as we are an emerging growth company 
we will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years  though we may cease to be an emerging growth company earlier under certain circumstances  including if  before the end of such five years  we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the sec which depends on  among other things  having a market value of common stock held by nonaffiliates in excess of million 
investors and securities analysts may find it more difficult to evaluate our common stock because we will rely on one or more of these exemptions  and  as a result  investor confidence and the market price of our common stock may be materially and adversely affected 
further  section b of the jobs act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies that is  those that have not had a securities act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the exchange act are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards 
the jobs act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to nonemerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable 
we have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies  we  as an emerging growth company  can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard 
this may make our financial statements not comparable with those of another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period because of the potential differences in accounting standards used 
our failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act could result in a restatement of our financial statements  cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and us and have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
prior to the combination  neither zaza nor zaza llc was required to evaluate its internal control over financial reporting in the manner that is currently required of certain public companies in the united states 
as a public company  we are required to document and test our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act and the related rules and regulations of the sec  the public company accounting oversight board  including annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm that addresses our internal control over financial reporting 
the requirement for such auditor report however  will likely not apply for four years assuming we remain an emerging growth company during such period 
if  as a result of deficiencies in our financial or other internal controls  including material weaknesses  we have not or cannot provide reliable financial reports or internal recordkeeping or compliance procedures  our business decisions or compliance processes may be adversely affected  our business and operating results could be harmed  we may be subject to legal penalties or other claims  investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information and the price of our stock could decrease 
the majority of our common stock is owned by the founders  whose interests may not be aligned with the interests of other stockholders 
under our stockholders agreement with the entities controlled by the zaza founders  the significant zaza owners  during the three years following the closing of the combination will be entitled to designate a proportional number of directors to the board but not more than seven based upon the significant zaza owners and their permitted transferees percentage ownership of zaza 
the remaining directors of zaza will be nominated by a nominating committee consisting of two directors selected by the designees on the board that were selected by toreador prior to the closing of the combination and their successors and one independent director selected by the significant zaza owners 
the three individuals that founded zaza llc  the zaza founders collectively own approximately of the common stock as of december  during the three years after closing  the zaza founders will be required to vote their shares in favor of the nominees of the nominating committee 
however  after the third anniversary of the closing  there will be no limitation on the number of directors of zaza that the significant zaza owners may nominate and elect and  as such  they may be able to nominate and elect the entire board and remove any directors  including directors who were toreador designees or nominated by the board s nominating committee 
in addition  as a result of their share ownership in zaza  the significant zaza owners will be able to control all matters requiring approval by zaza stockholders  including  but not limited to mergers  consolidations or acquisitions  the sale of all or substantially all of zaza s assets and other decisions affecting zaza s capital structure  the amendment of zaza s certificate of incorporation and bylaws  and zaza s liquidation  winding up and dissolution 
finally  under the stockholders agreement  the significant zaza owners are subject to a three year standstill period starting on the date of the consummation of the transactions 
however  once the stand still period ends  there will be no contractual restriction on the significant zaza owners ability to purchase additional shares of our common stock or take us private on terms that may not be favorable to the other stockholders of zaza 
the interests of the significant zaza owners may not be aligned with the interests of the other stockholders 
this concentration of share ownership may have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in a company with significant stockholders 
the zaza founders have economic interests in our properties and their interests may not be aligned with the interests of us 
the zaza founders are board members and collectively  beneficially own approximately of our common stock as of december  in addition to their interests as equity owners  each of these individuals also has a direct or indirect overriding royalty interest relating to certain of our properties 
these overriding royalty interests generally entitle them to three percent of the net revenue interest associated with sales of oil and gas produced from these properties  without any corresponding responsibility for payment of any expenses 
there is a potential market overhang that could depress the value of our common stock  and future sales of our common stock could put a downward pressure on the price of our shares and could have a material adverse effect on the price of our shares 
in december  we filed a resale registration statement on form s for the sale of approximately million shares of our common stock  including approximately million shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of our warrants 
a substantial majority of those shares remain unsold 
in addition  we also filed a resale registration statement on form s in december for the sale of approximately million shares of our common stock by certain current and former consultants and employees of the company 
a substantial majority of those shares remain unsold 
in october  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible notes  which are convertible into million shares of our common stock 
share of our common stock issued upon conversion of the convertible notes may generally be sold by non affiliates without restriction after october pursuant to rule under the securities act 
the possibility that substantial amounts of our outstanding common stock may be sold by such holders  or the perception that such sales could occur  could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities in the future 
in addition  this selling activity could decrease the level of public interest in our common stock  inhibit buying activity that might otherwise help support the market price of our common stock  and prevent possible upward price movements in our common stock 
in addition  the significant zaza owners have demand and piggyback registration rights pursuant to our stockholders agreement commencing on the six month anniversary of the closing of the combination 
pursuant to the lock up agreement entered into with the holders of our warrants  the significant zaza owners have significant limitations on their ability to sell any shares for five years  subject to certain exceptions 
the possibility that the significant zaza owners could sell under those exceptions could add to the effect of such overhang 
upon the expiration of the non competition agreements and under certain other circumstances  the three zaza founders will be able to directly compete with new zaza 
on august   each of the three zaza founders referred to as a restricted person entered into a separate non competition agreement with zaza 
the non competition agreements provide that each of the restricted persons and his controlled affiliates may not engage in  carry on or assist any oil or gas business in specified areas in the eagle ford and eagle ford woodbine resource plays in texas and the paris basin in france or acquire oil and gas interests in  or acquire interests in any businesses with oil and gas interests in  those specified areas  subject to certain exceptions 
the restricted persons also agreed not to advise  request  induce  attempt to induce or otherwise divert any customer  supplier  licensee or other business relation of zaza  zaza llc and toreador and their present and future subsidiaries  and further agreed not to materially curtail  limit or cease doing business with any such entities or materially interfere with the customer  supplier and other business relationships of  or oil and gas interests or the businesses of  zaza  and its present and future subsidiaries 
the non competition agreement with each restricted person lasts only until the later of the termination of the restricted person s employment with zaza or three years after the consummation of the transaction 
in addition  the non competition agreements do not apply to any opportunity in which the restricted persons would be prohibited from participating  if such opportunity is first offered to zaza and a majority of the full board of directors of zaza  including a majority of the disinterested directors  declines to pursue such opportunity  or a majority of the disinterested directors fails to make a determination as to whether zaza will pursue such opportunity within ten business days following such offer 
upon the expiration of the non competition agreements  or during the term of the non competition agreements if the zaza board of directors declines or fails to determine whether to pursue a corporate opportunity within ten business days  the zaza founders will be free to pursue competitive activities or such corporate opportunities  which could create conflicts of interest and limit zaza s ability to acquire additional assets or pursue its businesses and could have a material adverse effect on us 
we are a controlled company within the meaning of the nasdaq rules and qualify for  and rely on  exemptions from certain corporate governance standards  which may limit the presence of independent directors on the board of directors or board committees of zaza 
the zaza founders beneficially own shares of our stock which represents approximately of the outstanding voting power of our capital stock as of december  accordingly  the zaza founders will have the ability to elect our board of directors and thereby control the management and affairs of zaza 
therefore  we are deemed to be a controlled company for purposes of nasdaq rule c 
under this rule  a company of which more than of the voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual  a group or another company is a controlled company and may elect to be exempt from certain corporate governance requirements  including requirements that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors  compensation of officers be determined or recommended to the board of directors by a majority of its independent directors or by a compensation committee comprised of independent directors 
conversion of the convertible notes and exercise of the warrants may dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders  or may otherwise depress the market price of our common stock 
the conversion of some or all of the convertible notes and the exercise of some or all of the warrants may dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders of our common stock 
any sales in the public market of the shares of our common stock issuable upon such conversion or exercise could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
in addition  the existence of the convertible notes and the warrants may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the convertible notes or exercise of the warrants could be used to satisfy short positions  or anticipated conversion of the convertible notes into shares of our common stock or exercise of the warrants could depress the market price of our common stock 
provisions of delaware law  our charter documents and the agreements governing the convertible notes and the senior secured notes may impede or discourage a takeover  which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
we are a delaware corporation  and the anti takeover provisions of delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us  even if a fundamental change or a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders 
in addition  our board of directors has the power  without stockholder approval  to designate the terms of one or more series of preferred stock and issue shares of preferred stock 
the ability of our board of directors to create and issue a new series of preferred stock and certain provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede a merger  takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock  which  under certain circumstances  could reduce the market price of our common stock 
in addition  certain provisions of the convertible notes and the senior secured notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us 
upon the occurrence of a fundamental change  subject to certain conditions  holders of senior secured notes and convertible notes will have the right  at their option  to require us to purchase for cash all or any portion of their notes 
we may also be required  under certain circumstances  to increase the conversion rate for the convertible notes if a holder elects to convert its convertible notes in connection with a make whole fundamental change

zaza llc was previously controlled by the zaza founders who each beneficially owned one third of the outstanding limited liability company interests of zaza llc 
zaza llc operations have been concentrated in south texas  including its exploration area in the core area of the eagle ford shale formation and in the eastern extension of the eagle ford woodbine formation  which we refer to as the eaglebine 
zaza llc s initial exploration and production activities were undertaken primarily through a joint venture with hess corporation  which accumulated approximately  gross acres approximately  net acres to zaza llc 
zaza llc operated the hess joint venture properties during the first year of drilling  after which hess had an election to take over operatorship 
this provision enabled zaza llc to build an operating track record during this first year of drilling 
as operator of the hess joint venture  zaza llc successfully drilled and completed eagle ford wells 
hess then elected to take over operatorship  and the transition from zaza llc to hess commenced in november and was expected to be completed in july in conjunction with the operatorship transition  hess also made public announcements in the first quarter of that indicated that they intended to pursue a drilling program in that was slower than zaza llc had anticipated 
the combination of hess taking over operatorship and the expectation that hess would slow the drilling program led zaza llc to negotiate an exit from the hess joint venture in july as a result of this exit  zaza llc relinquished the cotulla area and regained operational control of approximately of the venture s former acreage totaling  net acres 
as described below  toreador also exited its joint venture with hess in france  which had stalled due to french governmental regulations on the development of unconventional resources 
this resulted in zaza converting its working interest in the french exploration licenses to a non cost bearing revenue interest for up to million in cash receipts

toreador resources corporation prior to the combination  toreador was a publicly held independent energy company engaged in the exploration and production of crude oil with interests in developed and undeveloped oil properties in the paris basin  france 
at the time of the combination  toreador operated solely in the paris basin and its operations consisted of i a joint venture with hess corporation in the paris basin focused on unconventional resources and ii conventional paris basin assets held by zaza energy france sas 
the unconventional resource joint venture with hess stalled due to french governmental regulations 
zaza ended the hess paris venture in july by exchanging its working interest in the paris basin exploration licenses it held together with hess for a cost free revenue interest in such licenses  in which the total proceeds relating thereto to zaza are capped at million 
following zaza s exit from the unconventional resource play in france  zaza divested its paris basin conventional assets in december through the sale of of the shares in zaza energy france sas to vermillion rep sas  a wholly owned subsidiary of vermillion energy inc  for a net sales price of approximately million

hess joint venture dissolution based on public communications from hess  it became clear that hess and zaza had different understandings about hess s obligations under the agreement relating to our joint venture 
correspondence and communications between the parties relating to the disagreements between the parties led to the conclusion that it would be in the best interest of both parties to dissolve the joint venture and divide the combined assets 
these disagreements included overhead allocations and reimbursements  timing of the delivery of lease assignments and net acreage shortfalls some of which disagreements are the subject of our claim against flmk emerald leasing discussed in note commitments and contingencies  timing and amounts of payments  drilling obligations and drilling schedules  obligations to transfer undrilled acreage to zaza prior to lease expiration  and the interpretation of the other rights and obligations of the parties

liquidity and capital resources this section should be read in conjunction with note basis of presentation  note agreement with hess corporation  note going concern and note long term debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this filing 
liquidity for  we are dependent on the sale of non core assets and the proceeds from the creation of a joint venture see below in order to maintain a positive liquidity position and to fund our debt service requirements 
our lack of sufficient current operating cash flow  the exploratory uncertainties surrounding the development plan of our recently announced joint venture  and the amount of our current indebtedness  when considered in the aggregate  raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we currently expect that the proceeds from the sale of our moulton prospect and the recently announced joint venture will continue to improve our overall liquidity position 
our plan assumes the above transactions are consummated in the second quarter of the first phase of the joint venture will result in zaza receiving million being carried on the drilling and completion costs of three exploratory wells 
the moulton sale will provide approximately million of cash but will also decrease our proved reserves and related operating income significantly 
we estimate that we will use a portion of the proceeds from these transactions to reduce the outstanding principal amount of our senior secured notes to approximately million by the end of in addition to the transactions  we are currently in the process of drilling and completing three stand alone exploratory wells 
these wells are estimated to cost approximately million in the aggregate and will be funded with readily available liquidity and cash flows from operations 
also included in the business plan is approximately million in leasehold costs to hold our leases that are not held by production 
to offset a portion of these costs  our business plan also includes a reduction in our general and administrative costs beginning in the second quarter of going forward  we will utilize cash flow from operations  alternative sources of equity or debt capital and possible asset divestitures to finance additional drilling operations in the eaglebine 
however  there is no assurance that asset divestitures will be available to the company at appropriate valuations 
absent additional sources of financing  or the sale of additional assets  the company will have to further reduce our expenditures in and beyond

kearby  and john e 
hearn jr 
together  the zaza founders  each determined to transfer to certain service providers approximately million shares of restricted common stock of the company  par value per share the restricted stock  held by entities controlled by the zaza founders 
because such transfers were expected to give rise to a compensation expense deduction to the company upon vesting of the grants  as opposed to giving rise to a deduction to the zaza founders  the company agreed to pay in cash to the zaza founders the economic value of any tax deduction the company receives as a result of these grants by the zaza founders

assignment of stadium suite lease on september   zaza llc entered into that certain reliant stadium suite lease agreement the original suite lease with houston nfl holdings  lp the landlord  whereby zaza llc leased a luxury suite at reliant stadium for houston texans professional football games and certain other events 
on february   zaza llc entered into that certain houston texans reliant stadium suite lease agreement the amended suite lease with landlord  which amended and restated the original suite lease 
in order to reduce overhead costs  the company s board of directors has approved the assignment and assumption of the amended suite lease  and  subject to landlord approval  zaza llc will assign the amended suite lease to blackstone oil gas  llc blackstone  and blackstone will agree to assume from zaza llc  zaza llc s obligations under the amended suite lease 
todd a 
brooks  president and chief executive officer of the company  holds all outstanding equity interests in blackstone and is its president 
the landlord has not yet consented to such assignment and assumption  but is expected to do so 
to the extent the assignment and assumption are approved by the landlord  and the amended suite lease is assigned to blackstone and then subsequently assigned by blackstone to a third party for a profit  blackstone will reimburse the company for the value of the benefit  if any  which it receives 
the term of the amended suite lease commenced at the start of the national football league nfl season and will terminate at the conclusion of the nfl season 
the base rate including additional rent of rent for the amended suite lease is  for the first year of the term  and thereafter is subject to increases of up to five percent per year in each subsequent year 
blackstone previously paid for the first year s rent for and on behalf of zaza llc  for which blackstone will not be reimbursed 
the additional rent payments for the remaining six years of the amended suite lease will total no less than  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
the following represents those policies that management believes are particularly important to the financial statements and that require the use of estimates and assumptions to describe matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition and imbalances the company derives its oil and gas revenue primarily from the sale of produced oil and gas 
the company uses the sales method of accounting for the recognition of gas revenue whereby revenues  net of royalties are recognized as the production is sold to the purchaser 
the amount of gas sold may differ from the amount to which the company is entitled based on its working interest or net revenue interest in the properties 
revenue is recorded when title is transferred based on our nominations and net revenue interests 
pipeline imbalances occur when production delivered into the pipeline varies from the gas we nominated for sale 
pipeline imbalances are settled with cash approximately days from date of production and are recorded as a reduction of revenue or increase of revenue depending upon whether we are over delivered or under delivered 
settlements of oil and gas sales occur after the month in which the product was produced 
we estimate and accrue for the value of these sales using information available at the time financial statements are generated 
differences are reflected in the accounting period during which payments are received from the purchaser 
until the dissolution of the hess joint venture agreements  the company also derived its bonus income revenue from a bonus on leasehold amounts that hess agreed to participate in 
the bonus amount was equal to of the sum of all direct costs associated with acquiring the net mineral acres as defined in the eda and was recognized after the leases were obtained  title was cured and transferred to hess  and recorded with the appropriate county 
successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas activities the company accounts for its natural gas and crude oil exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting 
oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred 
lease rentals are expensed as incurred 
oil and gas exploration costs  other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells  are charged to expense as incurred 
the costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether they have discovered proved commercial reserves 
exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production or a conclusive formation test 
if proved commercial reserves are not discovered  such drilling costs are expensed 
in some circumstances  it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been found when drilling has been completed 
such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made 
costs to develop proved reserves  including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of natural gas and crude oil  are capitalized 
unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are analyzed on a property by property basis for any impairment in value 
if the unproved properties are determined to be productive  the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties 
zaza s third party engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves  which directly impact financial accounting estimates  including depreciation  depletion  and amortization 
our proved reserves represent estimated quantities of oil and condensate  natural gas liquids and gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recovered in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made 
the process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is very complex requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  engineering  and economic data for each reservoir 
the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving producing history  and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
consequently  material revisions upward or downward to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
depreciation  depletion  and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties are calculated using the unit of production method 
the reserve base used to calculate depreciation  depletion  and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves 
with respect to lease and well equipment costs  which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs  the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves 
estimated future dismantlement  restoration  and abandonment costs  net of salvage values are taken into account 
amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs  reserve revisions upwards or downwards and additions  property acquisitions and or property dispositions  and impairments 
when circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired  the company compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset 
if the future undiscounted cash flows  based on the company s estimate of future natural gas and crude oil prices  operating costs  anticipated production from proved reserves  and other relevant data  are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost  the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value 
fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate 
reserves estimate proved reserves are estimated quantities of oil and gas  which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward recoverable in future years from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire  unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain 
proved developed reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well and through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well 
proved undeveloped reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 
proved undeveloped reserves on undrilled acreage are limited i to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled  unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances and ii to other undrilled locations if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years  unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time 
income taxes for financial reporting purposes  we generally provide taxes at the rate applicable for the appropriate tax jurisdiction 
management periodically assesses the need to utilize these unremitted earnings to finance our foreign operations 
this assessment is based on cash flow projections that are the result of estimates of future production  commodity prices and expenditures by tax jurisdiction for our operations 
such estimates are inherently imprecise since many assumptions utilized in the cash flow projections are subject to revision in the future 
management also periodically assesses  by tax jurisdiction  the probability of recovery of recorded deferred tax assets based on its assessment of future earnings estimates 
such estimates are inherently imprecise since many assumptions utilized in the assessments are subject to revision in the future 
earnings loss per common share basic earnings loss per share was calculated by dividing net income or loss applicable to common shares by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented 
diluted earnings loss per share incorporate the potential dilutive impact of options and unvested stock outstanding during the periods presented  unless their effect is anti dilutive 
in addition  the company applies the if converted method to our convertible debt instruments  the effect of which is that conversion will not be assumed for purposes of computing diluted earnings loss per share if the effect would be anti dilutive 
the equity structure of the legal subsidiary the accounting acquirer has been retroactively adjusted using the exchange ratio established in the agreement and plan of merger and contribution  dated august   as amended  to reflect the number of shares of the legal parent the accounting acquiree issued in the reverse merger 
for the purpose of and earnings per share calculation eps the number of weighted average shares outstanding represents assumed shares outstanding as of december  and  as there were no changes in the capital structure of zaza llc during the years ended then 
the shares outstanding were calculated based on the toreador shares outstanding and the exchange ratio 
foreign currency translation the united states dollar is the functional currency for all of zaza s consolidated subsidiaries except for certain of its french subsidiaries  for which the functional currency is the euro 
for subsidiaries whose functional currency is deemed to be other than the united states dollar  asset and liability accounts are translated using the period end exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci on the consolidated balance sheets 
any gains or losses on transactions or monetary assets or liabilities in currencies other than the functional currency are included in net income loss in the current period 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is measured at the date of grant  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the vesting period of the award 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods to reflect actual forfeitures 
awards subject to vesting requirements for non employees will be fair valued each reporting period  final fair value being determined at the vesting date 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including the effects of adverse changes in commodity prices and  potentially  interest rates as described below 
the primary objective of the following information is to provide quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and gas prices and interest rates 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
all of our market risk sensitive agreements were entered into for purposes other than speculative trading 
commodity price risk our major market risk exposure is in the pricing it receives for its oil and gas production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing price for oil and the spot market prices applicable to natural gas production 
pricing for oil and gas has been volatile and unpredictable for several years  and this volatility is expected to continue in the future 
the prices we receive for its oil and gas production depend on many factors outside of its control  such as the strength of the global economy 
to reduce the impact of fluctuations in oil and gas prices on its revenues  or to protect the economics of property acquisitions  we in the future may periodically enter into derivative contracts with respect to a portion of its projected oil and gas production through various transactions that fix or  through options  modify the future prices realized 
these transactions may include price swaps whereby we would receive a fixed price for its production and pay a variable market price to the contract counterparty 
additionally  we may enter into collars  whereby it would receive the excess  if any  of the fixed floor over the floating rate or pay the excess  if any  of the floating rate over the fixed ceiling price 
in addition  we may in the future enter into option transactions  such as puts or put spreads  as a way to manage its exposure to fluctuating prices 
such hedging activities are intended to manage exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations 
interest rate risk zaza historically have not had any long term debt  but we have now incurred long term debt under our senior secured notes  convertible senior notes and subordinated notes 
we may enter into interest rate derivative contracts on a portion of its then outstanding debt to mitigate the risk of fluctuating interest rates 
fair value measurement risk the warrants associated with our senior secured notes and embedded conversion option and fundamental change provisions associated with our convertible secured notes are subject to fair value measurement risk 
the warrants were valued as written call options using a monte carlo stock option pricing simulation 
exercise behavior prior to maturity was simulated using a least squares approach based on the longstaff schwartz least squares monte carlo lsm option pricing model 
key inputs into this valuation model are our current stock price  libor zero coupon yield curve  and the underlying stock price volatility 
the debt was valued under the income approach using discounted cash flows 
the discounting utilized the libor zero coupon yield curve and our implied credit spread 
the current stock price and libor yield curve are based on observable market data and are considered level inputs while the stock price volatility and implied credit spread are unobservable and thus require management s judgment and are considered level inputs 
we used average daily stock price volatility of and credit spread of s p ccc rated companies 
the fair value measurements are considered a level measurement within the fair value hierarchy 
an increase in the volatility by results in a million increase in the fair value of the warrants 
a decrease in the volatility by results in a million decrease in the fair value of the warrants 
an increase the credit spread by basis points results in a million decrease in fair value on the notes 
a decrease in the credit spread by basis points results in a million increase in fair value of the notes 
on december   the senior secured notes  which had a book value of million  had a fair market value of approximately million 
the embedded conversion options were valued as written call options using a monte carlo stock option pricing simulation where exercise was based on periods where the stock price multiplied by shares plus the outstanding interest were greater than the value of the notes 
exercise behavior prior to maturity was simulated using a least squares approach based on the longstaff schwartz least squares monte carlo lsm option pricing model 
key inputs into this valuation model are our current stock price  libor zero coupon yield curve  credit spread curve  and the underlying stock price volatility

we used average daily stock price volatility of and credit spread of s p ccc rated companies 
the fair value measurements are considered a level measurement within the fair value hierarchy 
an increase the volatility by results in a million increase in the fair value of the conversion options 
a decrease in the volatility by results in a million dollar decrease in the fair value of the conversion options 
an increase in the credit spread by basis points results in million decrease in fair value of the convertible notes and a million increase in the fair value of the conversion options 
a decrease in the credit spread by basis points results in million increase in fair value of the convertible notes and a million increase in the fair value of the conversion options 
on december   the convertible notes  which had a book value of million  had a fair market value of approximately million 
counterparty and customer credit risk we are subject to credit risk due to the concentration of its oil and gas receivables with only a few significant customers 
please read business  industry properties marketing and customers for further detail about our significant customers 
our inability  or the failure of its significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation  may materially adversely affect our financial results 
in addition  any oil and gas derivative contracts that we may enter into in the future may expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties 
the risks inherent in our market sensitive instruments are the potential loss arising from adverse changes in oil prices and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below
