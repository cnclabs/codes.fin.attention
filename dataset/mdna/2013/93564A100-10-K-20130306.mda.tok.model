item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion and analysis that follows should be read together with the selected consolidated financial data and the accompanying financial statements and notes related thereto that are included elsewhere in this annual report 
it includes forward looking statements that may reflect our estimates  beliefs  plans and expected performance 
the forward looking statements are based upon events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control 
our actual results could differ significantly from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include but are not limited to  market prices for natural gas and oil  regulatory changes  estimates of proved reserves  economic conditions  competitive conditions  development success rates  capital expenditures and other uncertainties  as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report  including in risk factors and cautionary note regarding forward looking statements  all of which are difficult to predict 
as a result of these assumptions  risks and uncertainties  the forward looking matters discussed may not occur 
overview we are an independent energy company engaged in the exploration and development of domestic onshore oil and natural gas reserves 
we focus our efforts primarily on our waterflood oil recovery programs and horizontal drilling in the wilmington field within the los angeles basin of california and on the exploration and development of coalbed methane cbm properties located in the rocky mountain region 
as of december   we owned natural gas and oil leasehold interests in approximately  gross  net acres  approximately of which are undeveloped 
substantially all our undeveloped acreage is located in the rocky mountains 
our total net proved reserves are located on less than of our net acreage 
from our inception in through  we functioned principally as the sponsor of privately placed drilling programs and joint ventures 
under these programs  we contributed drilling locations  paid tangible drilling costs and provided turnkey drilling services 
we also served as operator of these drilling programs and the company retained an interest in the wells 
historically  a substantial portion of our revenue was attributable to these turnkey drilling services 
after our initial public offering in  the company has transitioned from being the sponsor of privately placed drilling programs to becoming a more traditional exploration and production company 
during the second quarter of  the company changed its accounting method for oil and gas properties from the successful efforts method to the full cost method 
as a result of this accounting change  turnkey profit  well services profit and marketing profit are not recognized on the statement of operations but are recorded as reductions to the full cost pool 
all historical information included in this form k has been retroactively restated to give effect to the change in accounting method 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents decreased million during to million at december  this resulted from cash provided by operating activities of million offset by cash used in investing activities of million and cash provided by financing activities of million 
cash provided by operating activities was primarily generated by oil and gas operations 
cash used in investing activities was primarily spent on oil and gas properties and equipment 
cash provided by financing activities primarily represented an increase in net debt under the credit facility 
on december   the company entered into a new  five year million second amended and restated credit agreement with bank of montreal  as administrative agent the agent  and various other lenders named therein  and warren resources of california  inc and warren e p  inc  as guarantors the credit facility 
the credit facility provides for a revolving credit facility up to the lesser of i million  ii the borrowing base  or iii the draw limit requested by the 
table of contents company 
the credit facility matures on december   is secured by substantially all of warren oil and gas assets  and is guaranteed by the guarantors  which are two wholly owned subsidiaries of the company 
in december  the borrowing base was increased to million 
the maximum amount available is subject to semi annual redeterminations of the borrowing base in april and october of each year  based on the value of the company proved oil and natural gas reserves in accordance with the lenders customary procedures and practices 
both the company and the lenders have the right to request one additional redetermination each year 
the company is subject to various covenants required by the credit facility  including the maintenance of the following financial ratios a minimum current ratio of not less than to including the unused borrowing base and excluding unrealized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments  and a minimum annualized consolidated ebitdax as defined in the credit facility to net interest expense of not less than to depending on the amount outstanding and the level of borrowing base usage  the annual interest rate on each base rate loan under the credit facility will be  at the company option  either a a libor loan  which has an interest rate equal to the sum of the applicable libor period plus the applicable libor margin that ranges from to  or b a base rate loan  or any other obligation other than a libor loan  which has an interest rate equal to the sum of the base rate  calculated to be the higher of i the agent prime rate of interest announced from time to time  or ii the federal funds rate most recently determined by the agent plus one half percent  plus an applicable base rate margin that ranges from to 
as of december   the company had borrowed million under the credit facility and was in compliance with all covenants 
if oil and gas commodity prices were to decline to lower levels  the company may become in violation of credit facility covenants in the future 
if the company fails to satisfy its credit facility covenants  it would be an event of default 
under such event of default and upon notice  all borrowings would become immediately due and payable to the lending banks 
during  the company incurred million of interest expense under the credit facility of which approximately million was accrued for as of december  the weighted average interest rate as of december   was 
our operations are affected by local  national and worldwide economic conditions 
we have relied on the capital markets  particularly for equity securities  as well as the banking and debt markets  to meet financial commitments and liquidity needs if internally generated cash flow from operations is not adequate to fund our capital requirements 
capital markets in the united states and elsewhere have been experiencing extreme adverse volatility and disruption  due in part to the financial stresses affecting the liquidity of the banking system  the real estate mortgage industry and the financial markets generally 
recently though  this volatility and disruption has been reduced 
if oil commodity prices were to drop precipitously and gas commodity prices stay the same or go lower  the company may not have enough liquidity to cover capital expenditures 
the availability of funds under our credit facility is critical to our company 
the borrowing base is to be redetermined on or about april  if the credit facility borrowing base is reduced to a level below current borrowings  the company would be obligated to begin reducing the deficiency by within days after the deficiency occurs and the remaining within days after the deficiency occurs 
low commodity prices may restrict our ability to meet our current obligations 
as a result  management has taken several actions to ensure that the company will have sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations through december   including a capital expenditure budget which is expected to be funded primarily by discretionary cash flow  entered into derivative agreements for a portion of its production to reduce price volatility and reductions in discretionary expenditures 
as of february   approximately of the company oil production is covered by put agreements 
if the liquidity of the company should worsen  the company would evaluate other measures to further 
table of contents improve its liquidity  including  the sale of equity or debt securities  entering into joint ventures with third parties  additional commodity price hedging and other monetization of assets strategies 
there is no assurance that the company would be successful in these capital raising efforts if they became necessary to fund operations during during  the company had net income of million of which million represented a loss on derivative financial instruments 
this compares to when the company had net income of million of which million represented a loss on derivative financial instruments and a net income of million in of which million represented a gain on derivative financial instruments 
at december   current assets were approximately million less than current liabilities 
as of february   the company has a borrowing base of million and million outstanding under the credit facility 
in the future  if natural gas inventories rise to levels such that no natural gas storage capacity exists  certain us natural gas production will need to be reduced or shut in 
additionally  if commodity prices decline to levels that make it uneconomic to produce oil and natural gas  the company or its partners may elect to shut in or reduce production 
as a result  some or all of the company oil and natural gas production may be shut in or curtailed during the next months  which would have a material adverse effect on operations 
the company proved reserves increased as of december  compared to prior years 
the increase was primarily due to drilling activities and the acquisition of additional working interests in the atlantic rim 
the company projects have material lease operating expenses 
our oil operations include a secondary recovery waterflood with significant fixed costs 
during  our oil lease operating expenses were per barrel of oil produced 
our natural gas operations include reinjecting the produced water into deep formations and compressing and transporting the gas with significant fixed costs 
during  our natural gas lease operating expenses were per mcf of gas produced 
the company proved reserves are based on assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate 
the company proved reserves for the periods indicated are listed below 
years ended december  estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves net oil reserves mbbls net natural gas reserves mmcf total net proved oil and natural gas reserves mboe estimated present value of net proved reserves pv value in thousands proved developed proved undeveloped total less future income taxes  discounted at standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows in thousands prices used in calculating reserves oil per bbl natural gas per mcf proved developed reserves mboe 
table of contents capital expenditure program at the present time  we are concentrating our activities in california and wyoming 
we have two california projects in the wilmington field  the wilmington townlot unit and the north wilmington unit 
additionally  we have a drilling project in wyoming referred to as the atlantic rim project 
during  our capital expenditure program approximated million which included million for our acquisition of certain atlantic rim properties 
the company drilled wells in california producers and injector 
the costs associated with the new oil wells in california wells were approximately million and the facility costs were approximately million 
the company did not drill any new wells in the atlantic rim project in wyoming 
if the company elects not to participate in drilling activities with its partners  it may lose all or a portion of its mineral leases and rights in certain acreage 
as a result  our proved reserves may decline 
also  unless we continue to develop our properties  production may decline and  as a result  reserves would decline 
lastly  complex federal  state and local laws and regulations may adversely affect the cost and feasibility of drilling and completion activities 
based on the commodity price outlook and hedge positions  the company forecasts a capital expenditure budget of approximately million  consisting of million for california oil drilling activities and million for wyoming 
the company may adjust its capital expenditures budget for wyoming after it completes its evaluation of the deeper rights  including niobrara oil potential and natural gas pricing 
the amount and allocation of actual capital expenditures excludes capital expenditures for any acquisitions and will depend on a number of factors  including oil and gas prices  regulatory and environmental approvals  agreements among various working interest owners  drilling and service costs  timing of drilling wells  variances in forecasted production and acquisition opportunities 
the above forecasted capital expenditures do not include acquisition capital 
the company intends to fund capital expenditures primarily with cash flow from operations 
during  warren plans to drill tar horizontal producers  upper terminal sinusoidal producers  and ranger sinusoidal producers in the wtu 
additionally  warren plans to drill ranger sinusoidal water injectors in the wtu 
in the nwu  the company plans to drill sinusoidal producers in the ranger formation and sinusoidal injectors in the wtu capital budget consists of for drilling and million for facilities improvements and other infrastructure costs 
warren plans to spend approximately million for drilling and million on infrastructure improvements in the nwu in additionally  the company will be performing d seismic mapping of the wtu and nwu geological formations at a budgeted cost of approximately million 
the company plans to spend approximately million in the atlantic rim project in the final determination regarding whether to drill and complete the budgeted wells and incur the capital expenditures referred to above is dependent upon many factors including  but not limited to the availability of sufficient capital resources  the ability to acquire proper governmental permits and approvals  and economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling such as prevailing and anticipated crude oil and natural gas prices and the availability of drilling equipment 
a substantial portion of our economic success depends on factors over which we have no control  including oil and natural gas prices  operating costs  and environmental and other regulatory matters 
in our planning process  we focus on maintaining financial flexibility and maintaining a low cost structure in order to reduce our vulnerability to these uncontrollable factors

critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
below  we provide expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies  estimates and judgments 
we believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management 
oil and gas producing activities we account for our oil and gas activities using the full cost method 
as prescribed by full cost accounting rules  all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
exploration and development costs include dry hole costs  geological and geophysical costs  direct overhead related to exploration and development activities and other costs incurred for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves 
salaries and benefits paid to employees directly involved in the exploration and development of oil and gas properties as well as other internal costs that can be specifically identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities are also capitalized 
proceeds received from disposals are credited against accumulated cost except when the sale represents a significant disposal of reserves  in which case a gain or loss is recognized 
the sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future development and dismantlement costs are depleted on the equivalent unit of production method  based on proved oil and gas reserves as determined by independent petroleum engineers 
in accordance with full cost accounting rules  warren is subject to a limitation on capitalized costs 
the capitalized cost of oil and gas properties  net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization  may not exceed the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves discounted at percent  plus the cost of unproved properties excluded from amortization  as adjusted for related tax effects 
if capitalized costs exceed this limit the ceiling limitation  the excess must be charged to expense 
there was no impairment charge in  and the costs of certain unevaluated oil and gas properties and exploratory wells being drilled are not included in the costs subject to amortization 
warren assesses costs not being amortized for possible 
table of contents impairments or reductions in value and if impairments or a reduction in value has occurred  the portion of the carrying cost in excess of the current value is transferred to costs subject to amortization 
our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and gas that engineering and geological analysis demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable from established reservoirs in the future under current operating and economic parameters 
reserves and their relation to estimated future net cash flows impact our depletion and impairment calculations 
as a result  adjustments to depletion and impairment are made concurrently with changes to reserve estimates 
our reserve estimates and the projected cash flows are derived from these reserve estimates  in accordance with sec guidelines by an independent engineering firm based in part on data provided by us 
the accuracy of our reserve estimates depends in part on the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgments of the individuals preparing the estimates 
revenue recognition oil and gas sales result from undivided interests held by us in various oil and gas properties 
sales of natural gas and oil produced are recognized when delivered to or picked up by the purchaser 
warren accrues for revenue based on estimated pricing and production 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu  comprehensive income presentation of comprehensive income  asu which amended asc  presentation of comprehensive income 
in accordance with the new guidance  an entity will no longer be permitted to present comprehensive income in its consolidated statements of stockholders equity 
instead  entities will be required to present components of comprehensive income in either one continuous financial statement with two sections  net income and comprehensive income  or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the guidance  which must be applied retroactively  was effective for the company beginning january  the adoption of asu did not have a material effect on the company consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued asu no 
 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss  to develop common requirements for valuation and disclosure of fair value measurements in accordance with us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
this asu became effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december  the adoption of asu did not have a material effect on the company consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities  to improve reporting and transparency of offsetting netting assets and liabilities and the related affects on the financial statements 
this asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning on or after january  we do not expect the adoption of this asu will have a material effect on the company consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  asu 
asu finalizes the requirements of asu that asu deferred  clarifying how to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
asu is to be applied prospectively 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of this asu will have a material effect on the company consolidated financial statements

the conversion rate for our convertible preferred stock is subject to adjustment in the event of the issuance of common stock as a dividend or distribution on any class of our capital stock  the combination  subdivision or reclassification of the common stock  or the distribution to all holders of common stock of evidences of indebtedness or assets  including securities issued by third parties  but excluding cash dividends or distributions paid out of surplus 

table of contents commencing seven years after their respective date of issuance  the preferred stock may be redeemed by the holders at a redemption price equal to the liquidation value of per share  plus accrued but unpaid dividends  if any 
at december   there were  preferred shares outstanding that the company may be required to redeem 
upon receipt of a redemption election  we  at our option  shall either pay the holder cash in an amount equal to per convertible preferred share  subject to adjustment for stock splits  stock dividends or stock exchanges  plus accrued and unpaid dividends  to the extent that we have funds legally available for redemption  or issue to the holder shares of common stock in an amount equal to of the cash redemption price and any accrued and unpaid dividends  based on the average of the closing sale prices of our common stock for the trading days immediately preceding the date of the receipt of the written redemption election by the holder  as reported by the nasdaq stock market  or by any exchange or electronic otc listing service on which the shares of common stock are then traded

off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas and oil prices and interest rates 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than speculative trading 
commodity risk our primary market risk exposure is in the price we receive for our natural gas and oil production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot regional market prices applicable to our us natural gas production 
pricing for natural gas and oil production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years  and we expect this volatility to continue in the future 
the prices we receive for production depend on many factors outside of our control  including volatility in the differences between product prices at sales points and the applicable index price 
we have entered into several commodity derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future oil and gas production 
we believe we will have more predictability of our crude oil and gas revenues as a result of these derivative contracts 

table of contents the following table summarizes our open financial derivative positions as of march  related to oil and gas production 
product type contract period volume price per mcf or bbl brent oil put  bbl d nymex gas swap  mmbtu d nymex gas swap  mmbtu d for put options  we typically pay a premium to the counterparty in exchange for the sale of the instrument 
if the index price is below the floor price of the put option  we receive the difference between the floor price and the index price multiplied by the contract volumes less the option premium 
if the index price settles at or above the floor price of the put option  we pay only the option premium 
under a swap contract  the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the index price for any settlement period is less than the fixed price  and we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the index price for any settlement period is greater than the fixed price 
interest rate risk we hold investments in us treasury bonds available for sale  which represents securities held in escrow accounts on behalf of certain debentures 
occasionally  we hold us treasury bonds trading securities  which predominantly represent us treasury bonds released from escrow accounts 
the fair market value of these securities will generally increase if the federal discount rate decreases and decrease if the federal discount rate increases 
all of our convertible debt has fixed interest rates  so consequently we are not exposed to cash flow or fair value risk from market interest rate changes on this debt 
at december   we had debt outstanding under our credit facility of million 
depending on the current level of borrowing base usage  the annual interest rate on each base rate borrowing under the credit facility will be at our option either a a libor loan  which has an interest rate equal to the sum of the applicable libor period plus the applicable libor margin that ranges from to  or b a base rate loan  or any other obligation other than a libor loan  which has an interest rate equal to the sum of the base rate  calculated to be the higher of i the agent prime rate of interest announced from time to time  or ii the federal funds rate most recently determined by the agent plus one half percent  plus an applicable base rate margin that ranges from to 
during  the company incurred million of interest under the credit facility of which approximately million of interest was accrued for at december  at december   the weighted average interest rate on our credit line was 
a increase in this rate would result in annual additional interest of million 
financial instruments our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  us treasury bonds  collateral security accounts  derivatives and other long term liabilities 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents and us treasury bonds approximate fair market value due to the highly liquid nature of these short term instruments or they are reported at fair value 
debentures  derivatives  other long term liabilities and the credit line are recorded at the approximate fair value of such items 
inflation and changes in prices the general level of inflation affects our costs 
salaries and other general and administrative expenses are impacted by inflationary trends and the supply and demand of qualified professionals and 
table of contents professional services 
inflation and price fluctuations affect the costs associated with exploring for and producing natural gas and oil  which have a material impact on our financial performance
