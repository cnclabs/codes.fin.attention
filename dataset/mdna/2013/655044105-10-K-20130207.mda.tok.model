our md a is presented in the following major sections executive overview  operating outlook  results of operations  proved reserves  liquidity and capital resources  and critical accounting policies and estimates 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  contain detailed information that should be read in conjunction with our md a 
executive overview strategy we are a worldwide producer of crude oil and natural gas 
we aim to achieve sustainable growth in value and cash flow through exploration success and the development of a high quality  diversified  growing portfolio of assets that is balanced between us and international projects  while maintaining a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity levels 
we primarily focus on organic growth from exploration and development drilling and augment that with a periodic  opportunistic new business development mergers and acquisition capability 
we manage the portfolio for superior returns and to ensure geographic portfolio diversification  with periodic divestments of non core assets 
we focus on basins or plays where we have strategic competitive advantage and which we believe generate superior returns 
core operating areas are the onshore us dj basin and marcellus shale  deepwater gulf of mexico  offshore west africa and offshore eastern mediterranean 
as a result of our continued exploration success  we are focused on the execution of a significant portfolio of major development projects that will deliver visible growth including  among others the horizontal niobrara in the dj basin and the marcellus shale  onshore us  gunflint and big bend in the deepwater gulf of mexico  tamar and leviathan  offshore israel  offshore cyprus  alen  carla  and diega  offshore west africa 
our major development projects typically offer long life  sustained cash flows after investment and attractive financial returns 
we maintain a diversified portfolio between us and international assets and strive to maintain a balanced geographic and political risk profile 
we also maintain a geographical diversity of production mix among crude oil  us natural gas  and international natural gas 
current business and industry environment the global economy continued its recovery during although there was modest growth in the us  china and emerging markets  europe continued to struggle with its debt crisis 
in the us  uncertainty continues to surround resolution of federal deficit issues 
it is difficult to predict the economic consequences on global markets as governments attempt to resolve these issues 
in the global crude oil market  supplies grew  primarily due to the application of horizontal drilling technology to liquids plays and increasing supplies from unconventional sources oil from tight formations and oil sands in the us and canada 
prices remained strong  supported by modest demand growth and continued security and other threats to the global crude oil supply system 
brent prices remain at a premium to wti primarily due to transportation constraints in the us mid continent area which impact wti netbacks 
in the us  the application of horizontal drilling technology has significantly changed the natural gas markets  resulting in an oversupply of natural gas and considerably lower henry hub spot and forward prices 
increased drilling in liquids rich gas areas and increased associated gas production from oil plays has yielded significant growth in onshore us ngl production 
as a result  the ngl market softened during  and ngl prices declined 
despite the uncertainty surrounding the global economy and continued volatility in commodity prices  we believe our portfolio positions us well moving forward 
we have material new production onshore us and offshore equatorial guinea  substantial liquidity and cash flow  a solid balance sheet  and a line up of major development projects which we expect to contribute to future growth 
results noble energy delivered significant growth in expansion of our horizontal niobrara and marcellus shale developments resulted in a increase in wattenberg production and a four fold increase in marcellus shale production 
we realized further production increases from major new developments at aseng  offshore equatorial guinea  and galapagos

we moved forward on our major development projects  each of which will yield significant new production in future years  discovered new resources at big bend in the deepwater gulf of mexico and carla  offshore equatorial guinea  and farmed into new opportunities offshore the falkland islands and sierra leone 
finally  we enhanced our portfolio with selective divestitures of non core  onshore us and north sea properties  and maintained our strong balance sheet

we expect to execute a final agreement with woodside during the first half of non core divestiture program our non core divestiture program is designed to generate organizational and operational efficiencies as well as cash for use in our capital investment program 
divestitures of non core properties allow us to allocate capital and employee resources to high value and high growth areas 
further  proceeds from divestitures provide additional flexibility in the implementation of our international exploration and development programs and the acceleration of horizontal drilling activities in the dj basin and marcellus shale 
during  divestitures generated net proceeds of approximately billion
