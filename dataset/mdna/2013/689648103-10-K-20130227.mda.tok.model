item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview otter tail corporation and its subsidiaries form a diverse group of businesses with operations classified into four segments electric  manufacturing  construction and plastics 
our primary financial goals are to maximize earnings and cash flows and to allocate capital profitably toward growth opportunities that will increase shareholder value 
meeting these objectives enables us to preserve and enhance our financial capability by maintaining desired capitalization ratios and a strong interest coverage position and preserving investment grade credit ratings on outstanding securities  which  in the form of lower interest rates  benefits both our customers and shareholders 
our strategy is to continue to grow our largest business  the regulated electric utility  which will lower our overall risk  create a more predictable earnings stream  improve our credit quality and preserve our ability to fund the dividend 
over time  we expect the electric utility business will provide approximately to of our overall earnings 
we expect our manufacturing and infrastructure businesses will provide to of our earnings  and will continue to be a fundamental part of our strategy 
reliable utility performance along with rate base investment opportunities over the next five years will provide us with a strong base of revenues  earnings and cash flows 
we also look to our manufacturing and infrastructure companies to provide organic growth as well 
organic  internal growth comes from new products and services  market expansion and increased efficiencies 
we expect much of our growth in these businesses in the next few years will come from utilizing expanded plant capacity from capital investments made in previous years 
we will also evaluate opportunities to allocate capital to potential acquisitions in our manufacturing segment 
we are a committed long term owner and therefore we do not acquire companies in pursuit of short term gains 
however  we will divest operating companies that no longer fit into our strategy and risk profile over the long term 
we have worked to realign our portfolio of businesses and refocus our capital investment in the electric utility 
in and we sold several businesses in execution of our announced strategy 
in we sold idaho pacific holdings  inc iph  our food ingredient processing segment business  and ew wylie corporation wylie  our trucking company which was included in our wind energy segment 
in january we sold the assets of aviva sports  inc aviva  a recreational equipment manufacturer and wholly owned subsidiary of shoremaster  inc shoremaster  our waterfront equipment manufacturer 
in february we sold dms health technologies  inc dms  our health services segment business 
in november we completed the sale of the assets of dmi industries  inc dmi  our manufacturer of towers for wind turbines and exited the wind tower manufacturing business 
in december we entered into negotiations to sell substantially all of the assets of shoremaster and completed the sale on february  as a result of these  and transactions  our business structure no longer includes wind energy  health services or food ingredient processing segments  and now includes the remaining four segments listed above 
in evaluating our portfolio of operating companies  we look for the following characteristics a threshold level of net earnings and a return on invested capital in excess of our weighted average cost of capital  a strategic differentiation from competitors and a sustainable cost advantage  a stable or growing industry  an ability to quickly adapt to changing economic cycles  and a strong management team committed to operational excellence 
major growth strategies and initiatives in our future include planned capital budget expenditures of up to million for the years through  of which million are for capital projects at otter tail power company otp  including million for otp s share of a new air quality control system at big stone plant and million for anticipated expansion of transmission capacity including million for mvps and million for capx transmission projects  excluding million for the brookings to southeast twin cities capx mvp project  included in the million above 
the remainder of the anticipated capital expenditures is for asset replacements  additions and improvements across otp s generation  transmission  distribution and general plant 
see capital requirements section for further discussion 
utilization of existing and potentially expanded plant capacity from capital investments made in our manufacturing and infrastructure businesses 
continued investigation and evaluation of organic growth opportunities and evaluation of opportunities to allocate capital to potential acquisitions in our manufacturing segment 
in our net cash from continuing and discontinued operations was million 
our plastics segment net income increased to million 
our manufacturing segment net income increased to million 
our electric segment net income of million decreased slightly from million in our construction segment recorded a net loss of million compared with a net loss of million in net income from aevenia  inc aevenia  our electrical design and construction services company  increased million while foley company foley  our mechanical and prime contractor on industrial projects  recorded a net loss increase of million as a result cost overruns on several large jobs 
the following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations for the years ended december in thousands operating revenues electric manufacturing and infrastructure total operating revenues net income loss from continuing operations electric manufacturing and infrastructure corporate total net income from continuing operations revenue increases in our plastics  manufacturing and electric segments were partially offset by a decrease in revenues from our construction segment  resulting in a increase in consolidated revenues in compared with revenues from our plastics segment increased million as a result of a combination of increased sales volume and higher prices per pound of polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe sold 
revenues from our manufacturing segment increased million as a result of higher sales volume due to improved customer demand for the products and services provided by our manufacturing companies 
revenues from our electric segment increased million as a result of a million increase in retail revenue  reflecting increases in transmission cost recovery revenues and revenues from minnesota customers following implementation of new rates in october  and a million increase in midwest independent transmission system operator miso schedule transmission tariff revenues  driven in part by returns on  and recovery of  capx investment costs and operating expenses 
revenues from our construction segment decreased million as foley s job volume and revenues recognized on a percentage of completion basis declined 
the following table sets forth actual consolidated diluted earnings per share results against the last forecast we provided for on a gaap basis  and also shows the effect on a non gaap basis of the early retirement of our million  senior unsecured note due the cascade note 
earnings per share guidance range november  gaap earnings per share non gaap items non gaap earnings per share low high electric manufacturing without shoremaster net loss from shoremaster construction plastics corporate recurring costs subtotal corporate premium paid on debt extinguishment total continuing operations discontinued operations net losses from discontinued operations premium paid on debt extinguishment in connection with dmi disposition interest expense on debt extinguished in connection with dmi disposition total discontinued operations total we retired early the cascade note from proceeds generated in connection with the divestiture of dmi 
generally accepted accounting principles require that in order for debt retirement premiums and related interest expense to be reported as discontinued operations  a company must be required by the lender to repay the related debt as a result of the disposition 
although we were not legally obligated to repay the aforementioned note  we believe it is appropriate to associate the debt prepayment premium and interest expense with our discontinued operations to provide a better indication of future earnings 
following is a more detailed analysis of our operating results by business segment for the three years ended december   and  followed by a discussion of our financial position at the end of and our outlook for results of operations this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes

other increases in the cost of electric service must be recovered through timely filings for electric rate increases with the appropriate regulatory agency 
our manufacturing  construction and plastics segments consist entirely of businesses whose revenues are not subject to regulation by ratemaking authorities 
increased operating costs are reflected in product or services pricing with any limitations on price increases determined by the marketplace 
raw material costs  labor costs  fuel and energy costs and interest rates are important components of costs for companies in these segments 
any or all of these components could be impacted by inflation or other pricing pressures  with a possible adverse effect on our profitability  especially where increases in these costs exceed price increases on finished products 
in recent years  our operating companies have faced strong inflationary and other pricing pressures with respect to steel  fuel  resin  aluminum and health care costs  which have been partially mitigated by pricing adjustments 
liquidity the following table presents the status of our lines of credit as of december  and december  in thousands line limit in use on december  restricted due to outstanding letters of credit available on december  available on december  otter tail corporation credit agreement otp credit agreement total we believe we have the necessary liquidity to effectively conduct business operations for an extended period if needed 
our balance sheet is strong and we are in compliance with our debt covenants 
financial flexibility is provided by operating cash flows  unused lines of credit  strong financial coverages  investment grade credit ratings and alternative financing arrangements such as leasing 
we believe our financial condition is strong and our cash  other liquid assets  operating cash flows  existing lines of credit  access to capital markets and borrowing ability because of investment grade credit ratings  when taken together  provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects

on may   we entered into a distribution agreement the agreement with jp morgan securities jpms under which we may offer and sell our common shares from time to time through jpms  as our distribution agent  up to an aggregate sales price of million 
equity or debt financing will be required in the period through given the expansion plans related to our electric segment to fund construction of new rate base investments  in the event we decide to reduce borrowings under our lines of credit or refund or retire early any of our presently outstanding debt  to complete acquisitions or for other corporate purposes 
also  our operating cash flow and access to capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside our control 
in addition  our borrowing costs can be impacted by changing interest rates on short term and long term debt and ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies  which in part are based on certain credit measures such as interest coverage and leverage ratios 
our common stock dividend payments have exceeded our net losses income in each of the last five years 
the determination of the amount of future cash dividends to be declared and paid will depend on  among other things  our financial condition  improvement in earnings per share to levels in excess of the indicated annual dividend per share of  cash flows from operations  the level of our capital expenditures and our future business prospects 
as a result of certain statutory limitations or regulatory or financing agreements  restrictions could occur on the amount of distributions allowed to be made by the company s subsidiaries 
see note to consolidated financial statement for more information 
the decision to declare a quarterly dividend is reviewed quarterly by the board of directors 
cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was million in compared with million in a major contributor to the million increase in cash from operations was a change from cash used for working capital of million in to million in cash provided from a reduction in working capital in continuing operations 
deferred debits and other assets increased million in compared to an increase of million in  mainly due to a smaller increase in regulatory assets in compared with net cash provided by discontinued operations of million in is mainly from the monetization of dmi s working capital in after dmi s operations were discontinued 
the proceeds generated by the monetization of dmi s working capital were used to pay down our line of credit after the line was used to repurchase the cascade note and to pay a million repurchase premium to retire the cascade note prior to its maturity date 
net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations was million in compared to million in the million increase in cash used for investing activities reflects a million increase in cash used for capital expenditures  mainly due to a million increase in capital expenditures at otp 
the increase in cash used for capital expenditures at otp is mainly related to expenditures for capx transmission line projects and initial expenditures for big stone plant s new air quality control system scheduled for completion in net investing cash flows from discontinued operations were million in compared with million in net proceeds from the sales of dms  dmi and aviva were million in  compared to net proceeds of million from the sales of iph and wylie in net cash used in financing activities of continuing operations of million in included million used for the early retirement of the cascade note  and million for the payment of dividends on our outstanding common and preferred shares 
this compares to million in cash used in the financing activities of our continuing operations in  when we paid out million in dividends 
also in  otp issued million in long term debt and used a portion of the proceeds to retire its million senior notes due december   and to retire early its million in pollution control refunding revenue bonds due december  a portion of the proceeds were also used to pay down otp s line of credit borrowings which were at million when the debt was issued 
we repaid million in short term borrowings and checks issued in excess of cash in in  net proceeds of million from the sale of iph were used to pay down short term debt 
bar chart capital requirements we have a capital expenditure program for expanding  upgrading and improving our plants and operating equipment 
typical uses of cash for capital expenditures are investments in electric generation facilities and environmental upgrades  transmission and distribution lines  manufacturing facilities and upgrades  equipment used in the manufacturing process  and computer hardware and information systems 
the capital expenditure program is subject to review and is revised in light of changes in demands for energy  technology  environmental laws  regulatory changes  business expansion opportunities  the costs of labor  materials and equipment and our consolidated financial condition 
cash used for consolidated capital expenditures was million in  million in and million in estimated capital expenditures for are million 
total capital expenditures for the five year period through are estimated to be approximately million  which includes million for otp s share of a new air quality control system at big stone plant and million for transmission projects including million for mvps and million for capx transmission projects  excluding million for the brookings to southeast twin cities capx mvp project  included in the million above 
the breakdown of  and actual cash used for capital expenditures and through estimated capital expenditures by segment is as follows in millions total for electric manufacturing construction plastics corporate total the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
in millions total less than year years years more than years coal contracts required minimums long term debt obligations interest on long term debt obligations capacity and energy requirements postretirement benefit obligations other purchase obligations operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations postretirement benefit obligations include estimated cash expenditures for the payment of retiree medical and life insurance benefits and supplemental pension benefits under our unfunded executive survivor and supplemental retirement plan  but do not include amounts to fund our noncontributory funded pension plan as we are not currently required to make a contribution to that plan 
in january our board of directors authorized the redemption in full of all four series of our cumulative preferred shares  which were called on january  for redemption on march  also  on january   otp caused call notices to be issued for the optional redemption in full on march   all of the outstanding grant county  south dakota pollution control refunding revenue bonds of which an aggregate of million was outstanding on such date and all of the outstanding mercer county  north dakota pollution control refunding revenue bonds of which an aggregate of million was outstanding on such date  in each case for which otp pays debt service 
additionally  on march  otp will pay off million in intercompany debt owed to us that represents our million in cumulative preferred shares outstanding 
all of the foregoing redemptions will be funded from a million term loan otp will be entering into 
the lower  libor based  floating rate interest under the term loan is expected to contribute to a reduction in pre tax interest expense in compared with capital resources financial flexibility is provided by operating cash flows  unused lines of credit  strong financial coverages  investment grade credit ratings  and alternative financing arrangements such as leasing 
equity or debt financing will be required in the period through given the expansion plans related to our electric segment to fund construction of new rate base investments  in the event we decide to reduce borrowings under our lines of credit  to refund or retire early any of our presently outstanding debt  to complete acquisitions or for other corporate purposes 
there can be no assurance that any additional required financing will be available through bank borrowings  debt or equity financing or otherwise  or that if such financing is available  it will be available on terms acceptable to us 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  our businesses  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected

financial covenants as of december  the company was in compliance with the financial statement covenants that existed in its debt agreements 
no credit or note purchase agreement contains any provisions that would trigger an acceleration of the related debt as a result of changes in the credit rating levels assigned to the related obligor by rating agencies 
our borrowing agreements are subject to certain financial covenants 
specifically under the credit agreement  we may not permit the ratio of our interest bearing debt to total capitalization to be greater than to or permit our interest and dividend coverage ratio to be less than to each measured on a consolidated basis  as provided in the credit agreement 
as of december  our interest and dividend coverage ratio calculated under the requirements of the credit agreement was to 
under the otp credit agreement  otp may not permit the ratio of its interest bearing debt to total capitalization to be greater than to 
under the note purchase agreement  note purchase agreement and the financial guaranty insurance policy with ambac assurance corporation relating to certain pollution control refunding bonds  otp may not permit the ratio of its consolidated debt to total capitalization to be greater than to or permit its interest and dividend coverage ratio to be less than to  in each case as provided in the related borrowing or insurance agreement 
in addition  under the note purchase agreement and note purchase agreement  otp may not permit its priority debt to exceed of its total capitalization  as provided in the related agreement 
as of december  otp s interest and dividend coverage ratio and interest charges coverage ratio  calculated under the requirements of the note purchase agreement and note purchase agreement  was to 
as of december  our interest bearing debt to total capitalization was to on a fully consolidated basis and to for otp 
our ratio of earnings to fixed charges from continuing operations  which includes imputed finance costs on operating leases  was x for compared to x for  and our debt interest coverage ratio before taxes was x for compared to x for during  we expect these coverage ratios to increase  assuming net income meets our expectations 
bar chart off balance sheet arrangements we and our subsidiary companies have outstanding letters of credit totaling million  but our line of credit borrowing limits are only restricted by million of the outstanding letters of credit 
we do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements or any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships 
these entities are often referred to as structured finance special purpose entities or variable interest entities  which are established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had such relationships 
business outlook we anticipate diluted earnings per share to be in the range of to 
this guidance reflects the current mix of businesses owned by us as we start out it considers the cyclical nature of some of our businesses and reflects challenges presented by current economic conditions  as well as our plans and strategies for improving future operating results 
our current consolidated capital expenditures expectation for is in the range of million to million 
this compares with million of capital expenditures in the major project contributing to the increase in planned expenditures is the new air quality control system aqcs for big stone plant to meet requirements of the federal clean air act and regional haze regulations 
we plan to invest in generation and transmission projects for the electric segment that are expected to positively impact our earnings and returns on capital 
in addition to the aqcs project  current electric segment projects include investment in three miso determined mvp transmission projects that will serve the nine state miso region  of which one is a capx project already underway  and investment with other utilities in one other remaining capx transmission project also under way 
segment components of our earnings per share guidance range are as follows eps by segment eps guidance low high electric manufacturing construction plastics corporate subtotal continuing operations corporate premium paid on debt extinguishment total continuing operations contributing to our earnings guidance for are the following items we expect net income to increase slightly in our electric segment in compared with this is based on rider recovery increases and an increase in afudc related to larger construction expenditures  offset by lower conservation improvement program incentives and increases in operating and maintenance expenses due to higher benefit costs 
otp s pension benefit costs for for our noncontributory funded pension plan are expected to increase by million in  reflecting a change in the assumed rate of return on pension plan assets from in to in and a decrease in the estimated discount rate used to determine annual benefit costs accruals from in to in we expect earnings from our manufacturing segment to improve in due to the following factors o increased order volume and continuing improvement in economic conditions in the industries btd serves  o a slight increase in earnings from to plastics  and o backlog for the manufacturing companies of approximately million for compared with million one year ago 
we expect higher net income from our construction segment in as it has implemented improved cost control processes in construction management and selectively bid on projects with the potential for higher margins 
was negatively impacted by the results on certain large projects at foley 
these projects are now substantially completed and foley s internal bidding and estimating project review procedures have been improved such that we do not expect to see similar losses in backlog in place for the construction businesses is million for compared with million one year ago 
the plastics segment experienced its second best earnings year in its history in due in part to certain market and weather related events that are not expected to recur in accordingly  we expect net earnings for plastics to be lower based on the market and weather conditions currently being experienced 
corporate general and administrative costs are expected to remain relatively flat between the years 
the sales of dmi and shoremaster were strategic decisions by management to monetize assets and divest of companies that do not fit with our current operating plans 
the divestitures free up liquidity going forward for upcoming electric segment capital investments 
we will continue to review our portfolio to see where additional opportunities exist to improve our risk profile  improve credit metrics and generate additional sources of cash to support the future capital expenditure plans of our electric segment 
this will result in a larger percentage of our earnings coming from otp  our most stable and relatively predictable business  and is consistent with the strategy to grow this business given its current investment opportunities 
the following table shows our capital expenditures and through anticipated capital expenditures and electric utility average rate base in millions capital expenditures electric segment transmission environmental other total electric segment manufacturing and infrastructure segments total capital expenditures total electric utility average rate base execution on the currently anticipated electric utility capital expenditure plan is expected to grow rate base and be a key driver in increasing utility earnings over the through timeframe 
we intend to maintain our equity to total capitalization ratio near its present level of in the electric segment and will seek to earn our authorized overall return on equity of approximately in the utility s regulatory jurisdictions 
our outlook for is dependent on a variety of factors and is subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in item a 
risk factors  and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies involving significant estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the discussion and analysis of the financial statements and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we use estimates based on the best information available in recording transactions and balances resulting from business operations 
estimates are used for such items as depreciable lives  asset impairment evaluations  tax provisions  collectability of trade accounts receivable  self insurance programs  unbilled electric revenues  accrued renewable resource and transmission rider revenues  valuations of forward energy contracts  percentage of completion  warranty and actuarially determined benefits costs and liabilities 
as better information becomes available or actual amounts are known  estimates are revised 
operating results can be affected by revised estimates 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed the application of these critical accounting policies and the development of these estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
pension and other postretirement benefits obligations and costs pension and postretirement benefit liabilities and expenses for our electric utility and corporate employees are determined by actuaries using assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of compensation increase and healthcare cost trend rates 
further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefit plans and related assumptions is included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
these benefits  for any individual employee  can be earned and related expenses can be recognized and a liability accrued over periods of up to or more years 
these benefits can be paid out for up to or more years after an employee retires 
estimates of liabilities and expenses related to these benefits are among our most critical accounting estimates 
although deferral and amortization of fluctuations in actuarially determined benefit obligations and expenses are provided for when actual results on a year to year basis deviate from long range assumptions  compensation increases and healthcare cost increases or a reduction in the discount rate applied from one year to the next can significantly increase our benefit expenses in the year of the change 
also  a reduction in the expected rate of return on pension plan assets in our funded pension plan or realized rates of return on plan assets that are well below assumed rates of return could result in significant increases in recognized pension benefit expenses in the year of the change or for many years thereafter because actuarial losses can be amortized over the average remaining service lives of active employees 
the pension benefit cost for for our noncontributory funded pension plan is expected to be million compared to million in  reflecting a change in the assumed rate of return on pension plan assets from in to in  and a decrease in the estimated discount rate used to determine annual benefit cost accruals from in to in in selecting the discount rate  we consider the yields of fixed income debt securities  which have ratings of aa published by recognized rating agencies  along with bond matching models specific to our plans as a basis to determine the rate 
subsequent increases or decreases in actual rates of return on plan assets over assumed rates or increases or decreases in the discount rate or rate of increase in future compensation levels could significantly change projected costs 
for  all other factors being held constant a increase in the discount rate would have decreased our pension benefit cost by  a decrease in the discount rate would have increased our pension benefit cost by  a increase in the assumed rate of increase in future compensation levels would have increased our pension benefit cost by  a decrease in the assumed rate of increase in future compensation levels would have decreased our pension benefit cost by  and a increase or decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have decreased or increased our pension benefit cost by  increases or decreases in the discount rate or in retiree healthcare cost inflation rates could significantly change our projected postretirement healthcare benefit costs 
a increase in the discount rate would have decreased our postretirement medical benefit costs by  a decrease in the discount rate would have increased our postretirement medical benefit costs by  see note to our consolidated financial statements for the cost impact of a change in medical cost inflation rates 
we believe the estimates made for our pension and other postretirement benefits are reasonable based on the information that is known at the point in time the estimates are made 
these estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of variables and are subject to change 
revenue recognition our construction companies record operating revenues on a percentage of completion basis for fixed price construction contracts 
the method used to determine the progress of completion is based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs 
the duration of the majority of these contracts ranges from less than a year up to three years 
revenues recognized on jobs in progress as of december  were million 
any expected losses on jobs in progress at year end have been recognized 
we believe the accounting estimate related to the percentage of completion accounting on uncompleted contracts is critical to the extent that any underestimate of total expected costs on fixed price construction contracts could result in reduced profit margins being recognized on these contracts at the time of completion 
we have a standard quarterly estimate at completion process in which we review the progress and performance of our contracts accounted for under percentage of completion accounting 
as part of this process  our reviews include  but are not limited to  any outstanding key contract matters  progress towards completion and the related program schedule  identified risks and opportunities  and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs 
the risks and opportunities include our judgment about the ability and cost to achieve the schedule  technical requirements and other contract requirements 
we must make assumptions regarding labor productivity and availability  the complexity of the work to be performed  the availability of materials  the length of time to complete the contract  and performance by subcontractors  among other variables 
based on this analysis  any adjustments to net sales  costs of sales  and the related impact to operating income are recorded as necessary in the period they become known 
these adjustments may result from positive program performance and an increase in operating profit during the performance of individual contracts if management determines it will be successful in mitigating risks surrounding the technical  schedule  and cost aspects of those contracts or realizing related opportunities 
likewise  these adjustments may result in a decrease in operating profit if we determine we will not be successful in mitigating these risks or realizing related opportunities 
changes in estimates of net sales  costs of sales  and the related impact to operating income are recognized using a cumulative catch up  which recognizes  in the current period  the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a contract s percent complete 
a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our contracts 
if a loss is indicated at a point in time during a contract  a projected loss for the entire contract is estimated and recognized 
forward energy contracts classified as derivatives otp s forward contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity are derivatives subject to mark to market accounting under generally accepted accounting principles 
the market prices used to value otp s forward contracts for the purchases and sales of electricity and electricity generating capacity are determined by survey of counterparties or brokers used by otp s power services personnel responsible for contract pricing  as well as prices gathered from daily settlement prices published by the intercontinental exchange and the cme globex 
for certain contracts  prices at illiquid trading points are based on a basis spread between that trading point and more liquid trading hub prices 
these basis spreads are determined based on available market price information and the use of forward price curve models  and  as such  are estimates 
the forward energy sales contracts that are marked to market as of december   are offset by forward energy purchase contracts in terms of volumes  delivery periods and points of delivery 
the differential in forward prices at the different delivery locations currently results in a net mark to market unrealized gain on otp s open forward contracts 
otp s recognized but unrealized net gains of  on forward purchases and sales of electricity marked to market on december  are expected to be realized on settlement as scheduled over the following periods in the amounts listed in thousands st quarter net gain allowance for doubtful accounts our operating companies encounter risks associated with sales and the collection of the associated accounts receivable 
as such  they record provisions for accounts receivable that are considered to be uncollectible 
in order to calculate the appropriate monthly provision  the operating companies primarily utilize historical rates of accounts receivables written off as a percentage of total revenue 
this historical rate is applied to the current revenues on a monthly basis 
the historical rate is updated periodically based on events that may change the rate  such as a significant increase or decrease in collection performance and timing of payments as well as the calculated total exposure in relation to the allowance 
periodically  operating companies compare identified credit risks with allowances that have been established using historical experience and adjust allowances accordingly 
in circumstances where an operating company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet financial obligations  the operating company records a specific allowance for bad debts to reduce the account receivable to the amount it reasonably believes will be collected 
we believe the accounting estimates related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is critical because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change from period to period and could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement and working capital 
during  for continuing operations   of bad debt expense of total revenue of million was recorded and the allowance for doubtful accounts was million of gross trade accounts receivable as of december  general economic conditions and specific geographic concerns are major factors that may affect the adequacy of the allowance and may result in a change in the annual bad debt expense 
an increase or decrease in our consolidated allowance for doubtful accounts based on one percentage point of outstanding trade receivables at december  would result in a million increase or decrease in bad debt expense 
although an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts on our operating companies accounts receivable is provided for  the allowance for doubtful accounts on the electric segment s wholesale electric sales is insignificant in proportion to annual revenues from these sales 
the electric segment has not experienced a bad debt related to wholesale electric sales largely due to stringent risk management criteria related to these sales 
nonpayment on a single wholesale electric sale could result in a significant bad debt expense 
depreciation expense and depreciable lives the provisions for depreciation of electric utility property for financial reporting purposes are made on the straight line method based on the estimated service lives to years of the properties 
such provisions as a percent of the average balance of depreciable electric utility property were in  in and in depreciation rates on electric utility property are subject to annual regulatory review and approval  and depreciation expense is recovered through rates set by ratemaking authorities 
although the useful lives of electric utility properties are estimated  the recovery of their cost is dependent on the ratemaking process 
deregulation of the electric industry could result in changes to the estimated useful lives of electric utility property that could impact depreciation expense 
property and equipment of our nonelectric operations are carried at historical cost or at the then current replacement cost if acquired in a business combination accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and are depreciated on a straight line basis over useful lives to years of the related assets 
we believe the lives and methods of determining depreciation are reasonable  however  changes in economic conditions affecting the industries in which our manufacturing and infrastructure companies operate or innovations in technology could result in a reduction of the estimated useful lives of our manufacturing and infrastructure operating companies property  plant and equipment or in an impairment write down of the carrying value of these properties 
taxation we are required to make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and our ongoing operations to estimate our obligations to taxing authorities 
these tax obligations include income  real estate and use taxes 
these judgments could result in the recognition of a liability for potential adverse outcomes regarding uncertain tax positions that we have taken 
while we believe our liability for uncertain tax positions as of december  reflects the most likely probable expected outcome of these tax matters in accordance with the requirements of accounting standards codification asc  income taxes  the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in additional adjustments to our consolidated financial statements 
however  we do not believe such adjustments would be material 
deferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial reporting purposes 
we assess our deferred tax assets for recoverability taking into consideration both our historical and anticipated earnings levels  the reversal of other existing temporary differences  available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
based on this assessment  management must evaluate the need for  and amount of  a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
as facts and circumstances change  adjustments to the valuation allowance may be required 
asset impairment we are required to test for asset impairment relating to property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may exceed its fair value and not be recoverable 
we apply the accounting guidance under asc  property  plant  and equipment subsequent measurement  in order to determine whether or not an asset is impaired 
this standard requires an impairment analysis when indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators are present  the standard requires that if the sum of the future expected cash flows from a company s asset  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying amount  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of the impairment is the difference between the fair value of the asset and the carrying amount of the asset 
we believe the accounting estimates related to an asset impairment are critical because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period reflecting changing business cycles and require management to make assumptions about future cash flows over future years and the impact of recognizing an impairment could have a significant effect on operations 
management s assumptions about future cash flows require significant judgment because actual operating levels have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
in  asset impairments were recorded at dmi  shoremaster and otesco 
the dmi and shoremaster impairments were recorded in connection with their sales value and are reflected in the results of discontinued operations 
as of december  an assessment of the carrying amounts of our remaining long lived assets and other intangibles indicated these assets were not impaired 
goodwill impairment goodwill is required to be evaluated annually for impairment  according to asc  goodwill subsequent measurement 
the standard requires a two step process be performed to analyze whether or not goodwill has been impaired 
step one is to test for potential impairment and requires that the fair value of the reporting unit be compared to its book value including goodwill 
if the fair value is higher than the book value  no impairment is recognized 
if the fair value is lower than the book value  a second step must be performed 
the second step is to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any  and requires that a hypothetical purchase price allocation be done to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
this fair value is then compared to the carrying amount of goodwill 
if the implied fair value is lower than the carrying amount  an impairment adjustment must be recorded 
we believe accounting estimates related to goodwill impairment are critical because the underlying assumptions used for the discounted cash flow can change from period to period and could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement 
management s assumptions about inflation rates and other internal and external economic conditions  such as earnings growth rate  require significant judgment based on fluctuating rates and expected revenues 
additionally  asc requires goodwill be analyzed for impairment on an annual basis using the assumptions that apply at the time the analysis is updated 
we currently have million of goodwill and a million indefinite lived trade name recorded on our balance sheet related to the acquisition of foley in foley generated a large operating loss in due to significant cost overruns on certain construction projects 
if operating margins do not meet our projections  the reductions in anticipated cash flows from foley may indicate that its fair value is less than its book value  resulting in an impairment of some or all of the goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets associated with foley along with a corresponding charge against earnings 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and as conditions warrant 
an assessment of the carrying amounts of our goodwill as of december  indicated the fair values of our reporting units are substantially in excess of their respective book values and not impaired 
acquisition method of accounting we account for acquisitions under the requirements of asc  business combinations 
under asc the term purchase method of accounting is replaced with acquisition method of accounting and requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  with limited exceptions 
acquired assets and liabilities assumed that are subject to critical estimates include property  plant and equipment and intangible assets 
the fair value of property  plant and equipment is based on valuations performed by qualified internal personnel and or with the assistance of outside appraisers 
fair values assigned to plant and equipment are based on several factors including the age and condition of the equipment  maintenance records of the equipment and auction values for equipment with similar characteristics at the time of purchase 
intangible assets are identified and valued using the guidelines of asc the fair value of intangible assets is based on estimates including royalty rates  customer attrition rates and estimated cash flows 
while the allocation of purchase price is subject to a high degree of judgment and uncertainty  we do not expect the estimates to vary significantly once an acquisition is complete 
we believe our estimates have been reasonable in the past as there have been no significant valuation adjustments to the allocation of purchase price

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december  we had no exposure to market risk associated with interest rates because we had no debt outstanding subject to variable interest rates 
all of our consolidated long term debt has fixed interest rates 
we manage our interest rate risk through the issuance of fixed rate debt with varying maturities  through economic refunding of debt through optional refundings  limiting the amount of variable interest rate debt  and the utilization of short term borrowings to allow flexibility in the timing and placement of long term debt 
we have not used interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings 
we maintain a ratio of fixed rate debt to total debt within a certain range 
it is our policy to enter into interest rate transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet our stated objectives 
we do not enter into interest rate transactions for speculative or trading purposes 
the companies in our manufacturing segment are exposed to market risk related to changes in commodity prices for steel  aluminum and polystyrene ps and other plastics resins 
the price and availability of these raw materials could affect the revenues and earnings of our manufacturing segment 
the plastics companies are exposed to market risk related to changes in commodity prices for pvc resins  the raw material used to manufacture pvc pipe 
the pvc pipe industry is highly sensitive to commodity raw material pricing volatility 
historically  when resin prices are rising or stable  sales volume has been higher and when resin prices are falling  sales volume has been lower 
operating income may decline when the supply of pvc pipe increases faster than demand 
due to the commodity nature of pvc resin and the dynamic supply and demand factors worldwide  it is very difficult to predict gross margin percentages or to assume that historical trends will continue 
otp has market  price and credit risk associated with forward contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity 
as of december  otp had recognized  on a pretax basis   in net unrealized gains on open forward contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity and electricity generating capacity 
due to the nature of electricity and the physical aspects of the electricity transmission system  unanticipated events affecting the transmission grid can cause transmission constraints that result in unanticipated gains or losses in the process of settling transactions 
the market prices used to value otp s forward contracts for the purchases and sales of electricity and electricity generating capacity are determined by survey of counterparties or brokers used by otp s power services personnel responsible for contract pricing  as well as prices gathered from daily settlement prices published by the intercontinental exchange and the cme globex 
for certain contracts  prices at illiquid trading points are based on a basis spread between that trading point and more liquid trading hub prices 
these basis spreads are determined based on available market price information and the use of forward price curve models 
the forward energy purchase contracts that are marked to market as of december   are offset by forward energy sales contracts in terms of volumes  delivery periods and points of delivery 
the differential in forward prices at the different delivery locations currently results in a net mark to market unrealized gain on otp s forward energy contracts of we have in place an energy risk management policy with a goal to manage  through the use of defined risk management practices  price risk and credit risk associated with wholesale power purchases and sales 
volumetric limits and loss limits are used to adequately manage the risks associated with our energy trading activities 
additionally  we have a value at risk var limit to further manage market price risk 
there was no price risk on open positions as of december  because the open purchases were offset by open sales at the same point of delivery
