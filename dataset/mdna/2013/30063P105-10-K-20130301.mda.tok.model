item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information contained in this section has been derived from our financial statements and should be read together with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview exact sciences corporation we  us  our or the company is a molecular diagnostics company currently focused on the early detection and prevention of colorectal cancer 
we have developed an accurate  non invasive  patient friendly screening test to meet our primary goal of becoming the market leader for a diagnostic screening product for the early detection of colorectal pre cancer and cancer 
our strategic roadmap to achieve this goal includes the following key components advance our product through us food and drug administration fda clinical approval process  commercialize an fda approved product that detects colorectal pre cancer and cancer  and secure favorable reimbursement for our product from payors 
our cologuard test is a non invasive  stool based dna sdna screening test designed to detect dna markers  which in published studies have been shown to be associated with colorectal cancer 
in addition to dna markers  our test includes a protein marker to detect blood in the stool utilizing an antibody based fecal immunochemical test fit 
colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the united states and the leading cause of cancer deaths among nonsmokers 
it is widely accepted that colorectal cancer is among the most preventable  yet least prevented cancers 
colorectal cancer typically takes up to years to progress from a pre cancerous lesion to metastatic cancer and death 
patients who are diagnosed early in the progression of the disease with pre cancerous lesions or polyps  or early stage cancer are more likely to have a complete recovery and to be treated less expensively 
accordingly  the american cancer society recommends that all people age and older undergo regular colorectal cancer screening 
of the more than million people in the united states for whom routine colorectal cancer screening is recommended  nearly percent have not been screened according to current guidelines 
poor compliance has meant that nearly two thirds of colorectal cancer diagnoses are made in the disease late stages 
the five year survival rates for stages and are percent and percent  respectively 
our cologuard test is designed to detect pre cancerous lesions or polyps  and each of the four stages of colorectal cancer 
the target sensitivity rate of our cologuard test for cancer is equal to or greater than percent at a specificity of percent 
in preliminary validation studies our test was able to detect cancers at or above this target sensitivity rate and we were also able to demonstrate strong pre cancer detection 
we believe the large population of unscreened and inadequately screened patients represents a significant opportunity for a patient friendly screening test like ours 
a powerful preventive tool that detects pre cancerous polyps and early stage colorectal cancer could significantly reduce colorectal cancer deaths and the health care costs associated with the disease 
pre cancerous polyps are present in approximately percent of average risk people years of age and older who undergo routine colorectal cancer screening 
the competitive advantages of sdna screening provide a significant market opportunity 
assuming a percent test adoption rate and a three year screening interval  we estimate the potential 
table of contents us market for sdna screening to be more than billion and we estimate the potential global market opportunity to be greater than billion 
our current focus is on seeking fda approval for our cologuard test 
we believe obtaining fda approval is important to building broad demand and successfully commercializing our sdna colorectal cancer screening technology 
we are also in the process of developing our strategy for the ultimate commercialization of our cologuard test 
in november we completed enrollment for our pivotal fda clinical trial with over  patients enrolled at enrollment sites in the us and canada 
patient enrollment included more than colorectal cancer patients and more than pre cancer patients 
all patients provided a sample to be tested with our cologuard test  and received a fit test and a colonoscopy 
the results of the trial will establish the performance characteristics sensitivity and specificity of our cologuard test 
we are currently in the process of submitting the results of our trial to the fda through a three part submission of a manufacturing module  analytical module  and clinical module 
the manufacturing module was submitted to the fda in december and the analytical module was submitted in february we expect to submit the clinical module in the second quarter of we believe that obtaining a favorable national coverage decision and a favorable reimbursement rate from the centers for medicare medicaid services cms for our cologuard test will be a necessary element in achieving material commercial success 
with the goal of expediting receipt of a favorable coverage decision  we are working with cms to coordinate the cms coverage review with the fda pre market approval through a parallel review process 
this program provides a pathway to a potential cms national coverage determination shortly after an fda approval  should it occur 
we plan to focus marketing efforts on primary care physicians who prescribe a high volume of fobt and fit tests since this physician group has displayed a partiality for stool based screening methods 
six percent of primary care physician prescribers are responsible for of fobt fit volume 
we have generated limited operating revenues since inception and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to continue to incur losses for the next several years  and it is possible we may never achieve profitability 
priorities our top priorities for include completing the fda submission and cms coverage application for our cologuard test 
if for any reason our fda submission is substantially delayed  the fda does not approve our pma or such approval is substantially delayed  our business and prospects would likely be materially adversely impacted 
likewise it would be a material adverse event for our business if we do not receive a positive national coverage decision and favorable reimbursement rate from cms or if for any other reason we are unable to successfully commercialize our cologuard test 
in we also plan to focus on building our manufacturing capacity which includes continuous improvements to our fda compliant quality management system 
we currently expect that upon initial commercial launch we will process a significant percentage of cologuard test volume 
accordingly  another priority for us is establishing a clia certified lab facility to process cologuard tests and provide patient results 
in addition  in we plan to work toward launch readiness through building and deploying a top notch marketing team and continuing our outreach and education efforts to physicians  third party payors and advocates 

table of contents we also have identified a new opportunity for our sdna colorectal cancer screening technology focused on the inflammatory bowel disease ibd patient population 
we initiated an ibd clinical trial in the first quarter that will focus on this specific patient group  and plan on enrolling around ibd patients into the trial 
furthermore  we will work on developing enhancements to our cologuard test and identifying and conducting research on other potential pipeline products targeting other cancers  such as esophageal and pancreatic cancer 
results of operations our primary focus during was completing the development of our cologuard screening test and finishing enrollment for our clinical trial 
this led to an increase in research and development costs during the year of million 
in addition to accomplishing these goals  we ensured that we were well capitalized to meet our goals by raising million net of issuance costs in august through issuing common stock to the public 
comparison of the years ended december  and revenue 
total revenue was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  total revenue is primarily composed of the amortization of up front technology license fee payments associated with our collaboration  license and purchase agreement with genzyme 
the unamortized genzyme up front payment and holdback amounts are being amortized on a straight line basis over the initial genzyme collaboration period  which ends in january research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to increased efforts focused on completing enrollment for our clinical trial and preparing for our submission to the fda with significant increases in clinical trial expenses and associated professional fees 
we added key personnel to our clinical and research and development teams and the related expenses increased accordingly 
lab expenses consist of purchasing costs related to assay development and lab operations  and there was additional cost in this area as we finalized the assay design in amounts in millions change clinical trial expenses personnel expenses lab expenses professional fees stock based compensation other research and development license and royalty fees research collaborations total research and development expenses general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily a result of 
table of contents increased payroll and related expenses due to new general and administrative hires and increased operations 
amounts in millions change stock based compensation legal and professional fees personnel expenses other general and administrative facility costs total general and administrative expenses sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in sales and marketing expenses was a result of hiring additional marketing personnel and increased expenses incurred as a result of implementing a go to market strategy  branding and other marketing expenses 
amounts in millions change professional fees personnel expenses stock based compensation other sales and marketing total sales and marketing expenses investment income 
investment income increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an overall higher cash and marketable securities balance during the year ended december  as compared to the same period of interest expense 
interest expense increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase was due to interest expense recognized from a capital lease entered into in comparison of the years ended december  and revenue 
total revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  total revenue is primarily composed of the amortization of up front technology license fee payments associated with our amended license agreement with labcorp and our collaboration  license and purchase agreement with genzyme 
the unamortized labcorp up front payment was amortized on a straight line basis over the exclusive license period  which ended in december the unamortized genzyme up front payment and holdback amounts are being amortized on a straight line basis over the initial genzyme collaboration period  which ends in january revenues also include royalties on labcorp sales of colosure as well as charges for our third party royalty reimbursement obligation to labcorp which are recorded as reductions to revenue under financial accounting guidance 
the decrease in total revenue for the year ended december  when compared to the same period of was primarily the result of the labcorp up front payment being fully amortized into revenue at december  
table of contents research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in research and development expenses was primarily to support our efforts to develop and seek fda approval or clearance for our cologuard test 
this included hiring additional personnel and funding lab operation expenses

investment income increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an overall higher cash and marketable securities balance during the year ended december  as compared to the same period of 
table of contents interest expense 
interest expense increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this slight increase was due to additional interest expense recognized from our loan from the wisconsin department of commerce 
other income 
there was no other income for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  this decrease was due to the receipt of a qualifying therapeutic discover project grant issued by the federal government in which was not available in liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through private and public offerings of our common stock  cash received from labcorp in connection with our license agreement with labcorp  and cash received in january from genzyme in connection with the genzyme strategic transaction 
as of december   we had approximately million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and approximately million in marketable securities 
all of our investments in marketable securities are comprised of fixed income investments and all are deemed available for sale 
the objectives of this portfolio are to provide liquidity and safety of principal while striving to achieve the highest rate of return  consistent with these two objectives 
our investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the principal use of cash in operating activities for each of the years ended december   and was to fund our net loss 
the increase in net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to increased research and development activities 
the increase for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   was also primarily due to increases in research and development activities 
cash flows from operations can vary significantly due to various factors  including changes in our operations  prepaid expenses  accounts payable and accrued expenses 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and   respectively 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in was the result of increased maturities of marketable securities 
excluding the impact of purchases and maturities of marketable securities  net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  which was primarily the result of a decrease in purchases of property and equipment 
excluding the impact of purchases and maturities of marketable securities  net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of purchases of property and equipment net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in was primarily the result of an increase in the proceeds from the sale of common stock from million in to million in excluding the impact of the sale of common stock  net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for the same period in this increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to an increase in proceeds from the exercise of common stock options for the year ended december  the decrease in cash provided by 
table of contents financing activities for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in was primarily the result of a decrease in proceeds from the sale of common stock from million in to million in excluding the impact of the sale of common stock  the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from the genzyme strategic transaction from million for the year ended december  to none for the year ended december   and an increase in proceeds from the exercise of common stock options from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   slightly offset by the decrease in restricted cash of million during the year ended december  we expect that cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at december   will be sufficient to fund our current operations for at least the next twelve months  based on current operating plans 
however  since we have no current sources of material ongoing revenue  it is possible that we may need to raise additional capital to fully fund our current strategic plan  the primary goal of which is commercializing our fda approved non invasive sdna colorectal pre cancer and cancer screening test 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient additional funds to enable us to fund our operations through the completion of such plan  our results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected and we may be required to delay the implementation of our plan and otherwise scale back our operations 
even if we successfully raise sufficient funds to complete our plan  we cannot assure that our business will ever generate sufficient cash flow from operations to become profitable 
in order to complete our clinical trial for our cologuard test  we expect to spend approximately million to million in expenditures include costs for personnel  consultants  lab testing and clinical trial sites 
we believe we have enough cash on hand to fund these planned clinical trial expenditures 
although we believe that we have sufficient capital to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months  we may not have sufficient capital to fully fund the commercial development of our cologuard test 
the table below reflects our estimated fixed obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period description total less than one year years years more than years in thousands long term debt obligations obligations under license and collaborative agreements operating lease obligations capital lease obligations total includes expected interest payments related to long term debt obligations 
we have entered into license and collaborative agreements with johns hopkins university  the mayo foundation  genzyme  mdx health formerly oncomethylome sciences  and hologic  inc see note in the notes to the financial statements for further information 
commitments under license agreements generally expire concurrent with the expiration of the intellectual property licensed from the third party 
operating leases reflect remaining obligations associated with the leased facility at our headquarters in madison  wi 
capital leases reflect obligations under a capital equipment leasing arrangement 

table of contents net operating loss carryforwards as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the company also had federal and state research tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates through  if not utilized 
the internal revenue code and applicable state laws impose substantial restrictions on a corporation utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards if an ownership change is deemed to have occurred 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit  or that future deductibility is uncertain 
in general  companies that have a history of operating losses are faced with a difficult burden of proof on their ability to generate sufficient future income in order to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation against our deferred tax assets based on our history of losses 
the deferred tax assets are still available for us to use in the future to offset taxable income  which would result in the recognition of tax benefit and a reduction to our effective tax rate 
critical accounting policies and estimates management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  certain third party royalty obligations  accrued clinical trial costs  and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements included in this report  we believe that the following accounting policies and judgments are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
revenue recognition 
license fees 
license fees for the licensing of product rights on initiation of strategic agreements are recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the license period 
on june   we entered into an amendment to our exclusive license agreement with labcorp  which  among other modifications to the terms of the license  extended the exclusive license period of the license with labcorp from august through december accordingly  we amortized the remaining deferred revenue balance at the time of the amendment of million on a straight line basis over the remaining exclusive license period  which ended in december in connection with our january strategic transaction with genzyme corporation  genzyme agreed to pay us a total of million  of which million was paid on january  and million was subject to a holdback by genzyme to satisfy certain potential indemnification obligations in exchange for the assignment and licensing of certain intellectual property to genzyme 
our on going performance obligations to genzyme under the collaboration  license and purchase agreement the clp agreement  as described below  including our obligation to deliver certain 
table of contents intellectual property improvements to genzyme  if improvements are made during the initial five year collaboration period  were deemed to be undelivered elements of the clp agreement on the date of closing 
accordingly  we deferred the initial million in cash received at closing and are amortizing that up front payment on a straight line basis into revenue over the initial five year collaboration period ending in january we received the first holdback amount of  which included accrued interest  due from genzyme during the first quarter of and the second holdback amount of  which included accrued interest  due from genzyme during the third quarter of the amounts were deferred and are being amortized on a straight line basis into revenue over the remaining term of the collaboration at the time of receipt 
in addition  genzyme purchased  shares of our common stock on january   for per share  representing a premium of per share above the closing price of our common stock on that date of per share 
the aggregate premium paid by genzyme over the closing price of our common stock on the date of the transaction of million is deemed to be a part of the total consideration for the clp agreement 
accordingly  we deferred the aggregate million premium and are amortizing that amount on a straight line basis into revenue over the initial five year collaboration period ending in january in total  we recognized approximately million in license fee revenue in connection with the amortization of the up front payments and holdback amounts from genzyme during the year ended december  clinical trial accrual accruals are recorded for clinical trial patient site costs when the liability is probable and reasonably estimable 
for our pivotal fda clinical trial and other sample procurement studies we undertake periodically  an accrual is made for a patient site cost once the patient has progressed past certain steps in the patient assessment and sample processing procedure 
the accrual is estimated based on historical average patient reimbursement fees 
management has recorded an accrual of million at december  and for clinical trial costs related to site payments 
we do not expect that actual amounts paid for these patient costs will materially differ from the amounts accrued 
stock based compensation 
all stock based payments  including grants of employee stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units and shares purchased under an employee stock purchase plan espp if certain parameters are not met  are recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
the following assumptions are used in determining fair value for employee stock options and espp shares valuation and recognition the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the estimated fair value of employee stock options is recognized to expense using the straight line method over the vesting period 
expected term the company uses the simplified calculation of expected life  described in the sec staff accounting bulletins and  as the company does not currently have sufficient historical exercise data on which to base an estimate of expected term 
using this method  the expected term is determined using the average of the vesting period and the contractual life of the stock options granted 
expected volatility expected volatility is based on the company historical stock volatility data over the expected term of the awards 
risk free interest rate the company bases the risk free interest rate used in the black scholes valuation method on the implied yield currently available on us treasury zero coupon issues with an equivalent expected term 

table of contents forfeitures the company records stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
a forfeiture rate is estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates 
the fair value of each restricted stock award and restricted stock unit is determined on the date of grant using the closing stock price on that day 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model based on the assumptions in note to our financial statements 
tax positions a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets is reported if  based on the weight of the evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company has incurred significant losses since its inception and due to the uncertainty of the amount and timing of future taxable income  management has determined that a million and million valuation allowance at december  and is necessary to reduce the tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the change in valuation allowance for the current year is million 
due to the existence of the valuation allowance  future changes in our unrecognized tax benefits will not impact the company effective tax rate 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 balance sheet topic disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 
asu requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
entities are required to disclose both gross and net information about these instruments 
asu is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods 
the adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is principally confined to our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we invest our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in securities of the us governments and its agencies and in investment grade  highly liquid investments consisting of commercial paper  bank certificates of deposit and corporate bonds  which as of december  and december  were classified as available for sale 
we place our cash equivalents and marketable securities with high quality financial institutions  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one institution and have established investment guidelines relative to diversification and maturities designed to maintain safety and liquidity 
based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates  the potential losses in future earnings  fair value of risk sensitive financial instruments  and cash flows are immaterial  although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis
