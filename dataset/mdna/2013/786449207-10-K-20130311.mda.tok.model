principles of accounting for ownership interests in partner companies we account for our interests in our partner companies and private equity funds using one of the following methods consolidation  fair value  equity  cost or available for sale 
the accounting method applied is generally determined by the degree of our influence over the entity  primarily determined by our voting interest in the entity 
consolidation method 
we account for partner companies in which we maintain a controlling financial interest  generally those in which we directly or indirectly own more than of the outstanding voting securities  using the consolidation method of accounting 
upon consolidation of our partner companies  we reflect the portion of equity net assets in a subsidiary not attributable  directly or indirectly  to the parent company as a non controlling interest in the consolidated balance sheet 
the non controlling interest is presented within equity  separately from the equity of the parent company 
losses attributable to the parent company and the non controlling interest may exceed their interest in the subsidiary s equity 
as a result  the non controlling interest shall continue to be attributed its share of losses even if that attribution results in a deficit non controlling interest balance as of each balance sheet date 
revenue  expenses  gains  losses  net income or loss are reported in the consolidated statements of operations at the consolidated amounts  which include the amounts attributable to the parent company s common shareholders and the non controlling interest 
as of december  and for each of the three years in the period then ended  we did not hold a controlling interest in any of our partner companies 

table of contents fair value method 
we account for our holdings in nupathe  a publicly traded partner company  under the fair value method of accounting 
we accounted for our holdings in clarient  formerly a publicly traded partner company  under the fair value method of accounting following its deconsolidation in and through the date of the sale of our remaining interest in clarient in december unrealized gains and losses on the mark to market of our holdings in fair value method companies and realized gains and losses on the sale of any holdings in fair value method are recognized in other income loss  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
equity method 
we account for partner companies whose results are not consolidated  but over whom we exercise significant influence  using the equity method of accounting 
we also account for our interests in some private equity funds under the equity method of accounting  based on our non controlling general and limited partner interests 
under the equity method of accounting  our share of the income or loss of the partner company is reflected in equity income loss in the consolidated statements of operations 
we report our share of the income or loss of the equity method partner companies on a one quarter lag 
we include the carrying value of equity method partner companies in ownership interests in and advances to partner companies and funds on the consolidated balance sheets 
when the carrying value of our holdings in an equity method partner company is reduced to zero  no further losses are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations unless we have outstanding guarantee obligations or have committed additional funding to the equity method partner company 
when the equity method partner company subsequently reports income  we will not record our share of such income until it equals the amount of our share of losses not previously recognized 
cost method 
we account for partner companies which are not consolidated or accounted for under the equity method or fair value method under the cost method of accounting 
under the cost method  our share of the income or losses of such partner companies is not included in our consolidated statements of operations 
we include the carrying value of cost method partner companies in ownership interests in and advances to partner companies and funds on the consolidated balance sheets 
available for sale securities 
we account for our ownership interest in tengion  inc as available for sale securities 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value  based on quoted market prices  with the unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported as a separate component of equity 
unrealized losses are charged against net income loss when a decline in the fair value is determined to be other than temporary 
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting policies  methods and estimates are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements prepared by management and are based upon management s current judgments 
these judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current events and assumptions about future events 
certain accounting policies  methods and estimates are particularly important because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ from management s current judgments 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our financial statements as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include the following impairment of ownership interests in and advances to partner companies and funds  accounting for participating interests in mezzanine loans receivable and related equity interests  income taxes  commitments and contingencies  and stock based compensation 
impairment of ownership interests in and advances to partner companies and funds on a periodic basis  but no less frequently than at the end of each quarter  we evaluate the carrying value of our equity and cost method partner companies and available for sale securities for possible impairment based on achievement of business plan objectives and milestones  the financial condition and prospects of the company  market conditions and other relevant factors 
the business plan objectives and milestones we consider include  among others  those related to financial performance  such as achievement of planned financial results or completion of capital raising activities  and those that are not primarily financial in nature  such as hiring of key employees or the establishment of strategic relationships 
we then determine whether there has been an other than temporary decline in the value of our ownership interest in the company or value of available for sale securities 
impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value 
the adjusted carrying value of a partner company is not increased if circumstances suggest the value of the partner company has subsequently recovered 

table of contents the fair value of privately held partner companies is generally determined based on the value at which independent third parties have invested or have committed to invest in these companies  or based on other valuation methods including discounted cash flows  valuations of comparable public companies and valuations of acquisitions of comparable companies 
the fair value of our ownership interests in private equity funds is generally determined based on the value of our pro rata portion of the funds net assets and estimated future proceeds from sales of investments provided by the funds managers 
the fair value of our ownership interests in our publicly traded partner companies is determined by reference to quoted prices in an active market for the partner company s publicly traded common stock 
our partner companies operate in industries which are rapidly evolving and extremely competitive 
it is reasonably possible that our accounting estimates with respect to the ultimate recoverability of the carrying value of ownership interests in and advances to partner companies and funds could change in the near term and that the effect of such changes on our consolidated financial statements could be material 
while we believe that the current recorded carrying values of our equity and cost method companies and available for sale securities are not impaired  there can be no assurance that our future results will confirm this assessment or that a significant write down or write off will not be required in the future 
total impairment charges related to ownership interests in and advances to our equity and cost method partner companies and funds and available for sale securities were as follows year ended december  accounting method in millions equity cost available for sale total impairment charges related to equity method partner companies are included in equity income loss in the consolidated statements of operations 
impairment charges related to cost method and available for sale partner companies are included in other income loss  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
accounting for participating interests in mezzanine loans receivable and related equity interests through our relationship with penn mezzanine  we may acquire participating interests in mezzanine loans and related equity interests of the borrowers 
these interests may also include warrants to purchase common stock of the borrowers 
our accounting policies for these participating interests are as follows loan participations receivable our participating interests in penn mezzanine loans are included in loan participations receivable on the consolidated balance sheets 
in connection with each financing transaction  penn mezzanine assesses the credit worthiness of the borrower through various standard industry metrics including leverage ratios  working capital metrics  cash flow projections and an overall evaluation of the borrower s business model 
we use these analyses in connection with our possible participation in each funding 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the carrying value of each loan participation receivable for impairment 
a loan participation receivable is considered impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts principal and interest due according to the contractual terms of the participation agreement and related agreements with the borrowers 
we maintain an allowance to provide for estimated loan losses based on evaluating known and inherent risks in the loans 
the allowance is provided based upon our analysis of the pertinent factors underlying the quality of the loans 
these factors include an analysis of the financial condition of the borrowers  delinquency levels  actual loan loss experience  current economic conditions and other relevant factors 
our analysis includes methods to estimate the fair value of loan collateral and the existence of potential alternative sources of repayment 
we do not accrue interest when a loan is considered impaired 
all cash receipts from impaired loans are applied to reduce the original principal amount of such loan  until the principal has been fully recovered and would be recognized as interest income thereafter 
the allowance for loan losses at december  and was million and million  respectively 

table of contents equity participations our participation in equity interests acquired by penn mezzanine is accounted for under the cost method of accounting 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the carrying value of our participation in these equity interests for possible impairment based on achievement of business plan objectives and milestones  the fair value the equity interest relative to its carrying value  the financial condition and prospects of the underlying company and other relevant factors 
our participating interests in equity interests acquired by penn mezzanine are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
warrant participations we recognize our participation in warrants acquired by penn mezzanine based on the fair value of the warrants at the balance sheet date 
the fair values of warrant participations are bifurcated from the related loan participations receivable based on the relative fair value of the respective instruments at the acquisition date 
any gain or loss associated with changes in the fair value of the warrants at the balance sheet date is recorded in other income loss  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of the warrants is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
income taxes we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that we believe recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 
we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized in future years 
if we determine in the future that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
commitments and contingencies from time to time  we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions which arise in the normal course of business 
additionally  we have received distributions as both a general partner and a limited partner from private equity funds 
in certain circumstances  we may be required to return a portion or all the distributions we received as a general partner of a fund for a further distribution to such fund s limited partners clawback 
we are also a guarantor of various third party obligations and commitments and are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of provision required for these commitments and contingencies  if any  which would be charged to earnings  is made after careful analysis of each matter 
the provision may change in the future due to new developments or changes in circumstances 
changes in the provision could increase or decrease our earnings in the period the changes are made 
stock based compensation we measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
we estimate the grant date fair value of stock options using the black scholes option pricing model which requires the input of various assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the expected term of the award and the estimated volatility of our stock price over the expected term 
changes in these assumptions and in the estimated forfeitures of stock option awards can materially affect the amount of stock based compensation recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
the requisite service periods for market based stock option awards are based on our estimate of the dates on which the market conditions will be met as determined using a monte carlo simulation model 
changes in the derived requisite service period or achievement of market capitalization targets earlier than estimated can materially affect the amount of stock based compensation recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
the requisite service periods for performance based awards are based on our best estimate of when the performance conditions will be met 
compensation expense is recognized for performance based awards for which the performance condition is considered probable of achievement 
changes in the requisite service period or the estimated probability of achievement of performance conditions can materially affect the amount of stock based compensation recognized in the consolidated statements of operations

in november  our board of directors authorized us  from time to time and depending on market conditions  to repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock  with up to an aggregate value of million  exclusive of fees and commissions 
we are party to a loan agreement with a commercial bank which provides us with a revolving credit facility in the maximum aggregate amount of million in the form of borrowings  guarantees and issuances of letters of credit subject to a million sublimit 
actual availability under the credit facility is based on the amount of cash maintained at the bank as well as the value of our public and private partner company interests 
this credit facility bears interest at the prime rate for outstanding borrowings  subject to an increase in certain circumstances 
other than for limited exceptions  we are required to maintain all of our depository and operating accounts and the lesser of million or of our investment and securities accounts at the bank 
the credit facility  as amended december   matures on december  under the credit facility  we provided a million letter of credit expiring on march  to the landlord of compucom systems  inc s dallas headquarters which has been required in connection with our sale of compucom systems in availability under our revolving credit facility at december  was million 
at december   we had committed capital of approximately million to various private equity funds 
these commitments are expected to be funded in the next months 
the transactions we enter into in pursuit of our strategy could increase or decrease our liquidity at any point in time 
as we seek to acquire interests in new partner companies  provide additional funding to existing partner companies  or commit capital to other initiatives  we may be required to expend our cash or incur debt  which will decrease our liquidity 
conversely  as we dispose of our interests in partner companies from time to time  we may receive proceeds from such sales  which could increase our liquidity 
from time to time  we are engaged in discussions concerning acquisitions and dispositions which  if consummated  could impact our liquidity  perhaps significantly 
in may  we entered into a million loan agreement with warren v 
musser  our former chairman and chief executive officer 
since and through december   we have received a total of million in payments on the loan 
we received cash from the sale of collateral in early in the amount of million and no payments in or the carrying value of the loan at december  was zero 
in december  the loan documents were amended to take into account accumulated unpaid interest and to make certain other changes related to collateral  maturity dates and other terms 
under certain circumstances  we may be required to return a portion or all the distributions we received as a general partner of a private equity fund for further distribution to such fund s limited partners clawback 
the maximum clawback we could be required to return related to our general partner interest is million  of which million was reflected in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and million was reflected in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at december  our ownership in the fund is 
the clawback liability is joint and several  such that we may be required to fund the clawback for other general partners should they default 
we believe our potential liability due to the possibility of default by other general partners is remote 

table of contents for the reasons we presented above  we believe our cash and cash equivalents at december   availability under our revolving credit facility and other internal sources of cash flow will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements for at least the next months  including debt repayments  commitments to our existing companies and funds  possible additional funding of existing partner companies and our general corporate requirements 
our acquisition of new partner company interests is always contingent upon our availability of cash to fund such deployments  and our timing of monetization events directly affects our availability of cash
