table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  or md a  is provided as a supplement to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition  changes in our financial condition and results of operations 
the md a is organized as follows forward looking statements 
this section discusses how forward looking statements made by us in the md a and elsewhere in this report are based on management s present expectations about future events and are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances 
business overview 
this section provides an introductory overview and context for the discussion and analysis that follows in md a 
recent developments 
this section summarizes recent developments that affect our financial condition and operating results 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
this section discusses those accounting policies that are both considered important to our financial condition and operating results and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application 
results of operations 
this section provides analysis of the company s results of operations for the three fiscal years ended april  a brief description is provided of transactions and events that impact comparability of the results being analyzed 
financial condition and liquidity 
this section provides an analysis of our cash position and cash flows  as well as a discussion of our financing arrangements and financial commitments 
forward looking statements the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ substantially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those set forth under item a 
risk factors 
the following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
business overview we are a leading provider of optical subsystems and components that are used in data communication and telecommunication applications 
our optical subsystems consist primarily of transmitters  receivers  transceivers  transponders and active optical cables  which provide the fundamental optical electrical  or optoelectronic interface for interconnecting the electronic equipment used in building these networks  including the switches  routers and servers used in wireline networks as well as the antennas and base stations for wireless networks 
these products rely on the use of semiconductor lasers and photodetectors in conjunction with integrated circuits and novel optoelectronic packaging to provide a cost effective means for transmitting and receiving digital signals over fiber optic cable at speeds ranging from less than gigabit per second  or gbps  to more than gbps  over distances of less than meters to more than  kilometers  using a wide range of network protocols and physical configurations 
we supply optical transceivers and transponders that allow point to point communications on a fiber using a single specified wavelength or  bundled with multiplexing technologies  can be used to supply multi gbps bandwidth over several wavelengths on the same fiber 
we also provide products known as wavelength selective switches  or wss 
in long haul and metro networks  each fiber may carry to different high speed optical wavelengths 
wss are switches that are used to dynamically switch network traffic from one optical fiber to multiple other fibers without first converting to an electronic signal 
the wavelength selective feature means that wss enable any wavelength or combination of wavelengths to be switched from the input fiber to the output fibers 
wss products are sometimes combined with other components and sold as linecards that plug into a system chassis referred to as a reconfigurable optical add drop multiplexers  or roadm 
our line of optical components consists primarily of packaged lasers and photodetectors for data communication and telecommunication applications 

table of contents demand for our products is largely driven by the continually growing need for additional network bandwidth created by the ongoing proliferation of data and video traffic driven by video downloads  internet protocol tv  social networking  on line gaming  file sharing  enterprise ip internet traffic  cloud computing  and data center virtualization that must be handled by both wireline and wireless networks 
mobile traffic is increasing as the result of proliferation of smartphones  tablet computers  and other mobile devices 
our manufacturing operations are vertically integrated and we produce many of the key components used in making our products including lasers  photo detectors and integrated circuits  or ics  designed by our internal ic engineering teams 
we also have internal assembly and test capabilities that make use of internally designed equipment for the automated testing of our optical subsystems and components 
we sell our optical products to manufacturers of storage systems  networking equipment and telecommunication equipment such as alcatel lucent  brocade  ciena  cisco systems  emc  emulex  ericsson  fujitsu  hewlett packard company  huawei  ibm  juniper  nokia siemens  qlogic and tellabs  and to their contract manufacturers 
these customers  in turn  sell their systems to businesses and to wireline and wireless telecommunication service providers and catv operators  collectively referred to as carriers 
our cost of revenues consists of materials  salaries and related expenses for manufacturing personnel  manufacturing overhead  warranty expense  inventory adjustments for obsolete and excess inventory and the amortization of acquired developed technology associated with acquisitions that we have made 
as a result of building a vertically integrated business model  our manufacturing cost structure has become more fixed 
while this can be beneficial during periods when demand is strong  it can be more difficult to reduce costs during periods when demand for our products is weak  product mix is unfavorable or selling prices are generally lower 
while we have undertaken measures to reduce our operating costs there can be no assurance that we will be able to reduce our cost of revenues enough to achieve or sustain profitability 
since october  we have completed the acquisition of two publicly held companies 
we have also completed the acquisition of privately held companies and certain businesses and assets from six other companies in order to broaden our product offerings and provide new sources of revenue  production capabilities and access to advanced technologies that we believe will enable us to reduce our product costs and develop innovative and more highly integrated product platforms while accelerating the timeframe required to develop such products 
recent developments acquisition of red c optical networks  inc on july   we acquired all outstanding equity interests in red c optical networks  inc  red c  a delaware corporation  with subsidiary operations in tel aviv  israel 
red c is engaged in research  development and marketing of optical amplifiers and subsystems for the wavelength division multiplexing  or wdm  optical communication sector 
the acquisition will enable the company to broaden its product lines  primarily for telecommunication applications  by adding key amplification technologies  including erbium doped fiber amplification  or edfa  raman amplification and dynamic hybrid amplification 
these technologies are considered critical for reconfigurable optical add drop multiplexer  or roadm  line cards and are increasingly important in cost effectively extending the reach of transceivers and transponders especially for gbps and gbps coherent transmission  ultra long repeaterless links  and low latency networks
