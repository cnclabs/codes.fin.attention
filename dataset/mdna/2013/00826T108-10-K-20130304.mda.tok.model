overview we are a leading provider of life science tools and molecular diagnostic products that enable parallel analysis of biological systems at the gene  protein and cell level 
we sell our products to genomic research centers  academic institutions  government and private laboratories  as well as pharmaceutical  diagnostic and biotechnology companies 
over  peer reviewed papers have been published based on work using our products 
we have approximately  employees worldwide and maintain sales and distribution operations across the united states  europe  latin america and asia 
our operations consist of two reportable segments  affymetrix core and ebioscience 
affymetrix core accounted for approximately of total revenue and ebioscience accounted for approximately of total revenue during the year ended december  the remaining of total revenue came from our corporate business unit which was not deemed an operating segment 
affymetrix core is divided into three business units with each business unit having its own research and marketing groups to better serve customers and respond quickly to the market needs 
in addition  the business units share common corporate services that provide capital  infrastructure  resources and functional support  allowing them to focus on core technological strengths to compete and innovate in their markets 
the following describes the three business units that form affymetrix core expression this business unit develops and markets the company genechip gene expression products and services  and the quantigene line of low to mid plex rna measurement products 
genetic analysis and clinical applications this business unit develops and markets the company genotyping  such as the axiom product line  and arrays with clinical research applications  such as the cytoscan cytogenetics arrays 
life science reagents this business unit develops and sells reagents  enzymes  purification kits and biochemicals used by life science researchers 
ebioscience is operated as a separate business unit after the acquisition with its own research and marketing and manufacturing groups  but shares common corporation services with affymetrix core ebioscience this reportable segment specializes in the development  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of research tools in the areas of flow cytometry  immunoassays  microscopic imaging and other protein based analyses 
we have one additional business unit  the corporate business unit  which is comprised primarily of revenue from royalty arrangements  and field revenue from services provided to customers by the company 
its manufacturing operations are based on platforms that are used to produce various products that serve multiple applications and markets 
the corporate business unit is not deemed to be an operating segment 
all of our business units sell their products through our global commercial organization comprised of sales  field application and engineering support  and marketing personnel 
we market and distribute our products directly to customers in north america  japan and major european markets 
in these markets  we have our own sales  service and application support personnel responsible for expanding and managing their respective customer bases 
in other markets  such as mexico  india  the middle east and asia pacific  including the people republic of china  we sell our products principally through third party distributors that specialize in life science supply 
for molecular diagnostic and industrial applications market opportunities  we supply our partners with arrays and instruments  which they incorporate into diagnostic products and assume the primary commercialization responsibilities 
acquisition of ebioscience holding company  inc on june   we completed our acquisition of ebioscience  a privately held company based in san diego  california engaged in the development  manufacture and sale of flow cytometry and immunoassay reagents for immunology and oncology research and diagnostics the acquisition pursuant to an amended and restated agreement and plan of merger dated may  the acquisition agreement 
we believe the acquisition is a good strategic fit for affymetrix  allowing us to expand our addressable markets and continue to diversify our business beyond genomics discovery into cell and protein analysis 
we believe ebioscience will enable us to further expand into downstream markets where validation and testing activity leverages the results of basic discovery research to achieve a more thorough understanding of disease states  and ultimately  new and or improved diagnostics and therapeutics 
we intend to operate ebioscience as a separate business unit to minimize or avoid any disruption of services  while taking advantage of immediate opportunities to create efficiencies 
we expect to achieve certain commercial synergies between the two companies  including cross selling opportunities and complementary distribution channels  as well as realize benefits from certain research and development synergies 
the acquisition purchase price totaled million  plus million in other fees and expenses incurred since the transaction began  including million of underwriting and financing fees  and was financed through a combination of cash on hand  the liquidation of available for sale securities  proceeds from the term loan of aggregate principal amount of million provided under our senior secured credit facility and the issuance of million principal amount of our notes 
reportable operating segments to better serve our markets subsequent to our acquisition of ebioscience  during the year ended december   we have organized our business units into two reportable operating segments affymetrix core and ebioscience 
affymetrix core represents the aggregate of the expression  genetic analysis and clinical applications and life science reagents business units with each having its own development  manufacturing and marketing groups 
the business units will share common corporate services that provide capital  infrastructure  resources and functional support 
these corporate services will be included in the corporate business unit 
ebioscience is organized as a separate business unit in order to minimize disruption of its existing operations  and we evaluate the performance of ebioscience separately from affymetrix core performance based on its revenue and income loss from operations 
for the year ended december   the ebioscience reportable operating segment had million in net revenue and million in operating loss  from the acquisition date 
the corporate business unit is not aggregated into either of the two operating segments and will be disclosed in the other category 
see item financial statements and supplementary data note segment and geographic information for more information on our reportable operating segments 
overview of fiscal year and strategic initiatives we have faced declining financial performance over the past several years 
traditionally  a significant portion of our business was in the well established gene expression business where our genechip expression product line comprised of at least of our revenue as we concentrated on selling these products in the basic research market focused on discovery research 
declining sales and intense competition from newer technologies such next generation sequencing in this business has led to decreasing revenue annually since since frank witney became our president and chief executive officer in july  we have begun shifting our resources and focus areas from a dependency on our expression business unit to a more diversified portfolio with broader revenue stream capabilities that can reach into the growing markets for translational medicine and molecular diagnostics 
in  affymetrix core reported lower overall revenue of million as compared to  primarily due to a million decrease in our expression business unit resulting from a lower volume of sales 
revenue from this business unit was approximately of our business in as compared to over in this decrease was partially offset by an million increase in our genetic analysis and clinical applications business unit due to an increased volume of sales in our cytogenetics line of products which more than doubled in from as we enter  we continue to execute on a strategy developed by dr 
witney and our management team where we will realign our product portfolio  stabilize our core business and position our company for growth and increasing profitability 
we expect this transformation to take several years  and have categorized this plan into three phases 
phase portfolio realignment 
during this phase  we reorganized ourselves into business units to sharpen our business focus based on target markets 
we also launched cytoscan  our growing cytogenetic microarray product line  grew our axiom genotyping platform aggressively and acquired ebioscience 
we believe these actions will lead to a stabilization of our core business and the realignment of our product portfolio will position us for growth 
phase ii profitability  strengthen balance sheet  development of newer product lines 
in the beginning of  we implemented a corporate restructuring with a goal of accelerating our path to profitability 
we expect the corporate restructuring is expected to result in annualized savings of approximately million based on run rates  of which million is expected to be in cost of goods sold 
our priorities for this phase will be to achieve profitability  repay our senior secured debt  successfully commercialize our newer product lines cytoscan  axiom and quantigene lines  as well as our ebioscience products and invest in new product offerings 
in addition  we will train and refocus our global commercial organization to expand our reach to customers in the translational medicine  molecular diagnostics and applied markets 
phase iii strategic flexibility  expansion of product lines  growth 
our goal is to have a strong balance sheet in this phase that will provide us with the flexibility to make strategic acquisitions 
in addition  we aim to grow revenues with developed product lines and new product offerings in the translational medicine and molecular diagnostic markets 
critical accounting policies estimates general the following section of management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are fully described in item financial statements and supplementary data note summary of significant accounting policies 
however  certain accounting policies are particularly important to the reporting of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we enter into contracts to sell our products and  while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions  there are agreements that contain multiple elements or non standard terms and conditions 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if so  how the value of the arrangement should be allocated among the deliverable elements  when and how to recognize revenue for each element  and the period over which revenue should be recognized 
inventories we enter into inventory purchases and commitments so that we can meet future shipment schedules based on forecasted demand for our products 
the business environment in which we operate is subject to rapid changes in technology and customer demand 
we perform a detailed assessment of inventory each period  which includes a review of  among other factors  demand requirements  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  product expiration and quality issues 
based on this analysis  we record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess  obsolete or impaired goods  when appropriate  in order to report inventory at net realizable value 
these inventory adjustments may be required if actual demand  component costs  supplier arrangements  or product life cycles differ from our estimates 
any such adjustments would result in a charge to our results of operations 
business combinations to account for our acquisition of ebioscience  we used the acquisition method of accounting which requires us to allocate the fair value of the total consideration transferred to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of the acquisition  with the difference between the net assets acquired and the total consideration transferred recorded as goodwill 
the fair values assigned  defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants  are based on significant estimates and assumptions determined by management 
these estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement  as a result  during the adjustment period  which may be up to one year from the acquisition date  we may record adjustments to the assets acquired or liabilities assumed with any corresponding offset to goodwill 
upon conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed  whichever comes first  any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations 
we used a discounted cash flow method to assign fair values to acquired identifiable intangible assets 
this method requires significant management judgment to forecast future operating results and establish residual growth rates and discount factors 
these models are based on reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances  including industry estimates and averages  as of the acquisition dates and are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business 
if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the estimates and assumptions used to develop these values  we could experience impairment charges 
in addition  we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense 
if our estimates of the economic lives change  depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 
goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets impairment assessments we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable 
we first conduct an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we then conduct a two step test for impairment of goodwill 
in the first step  the fair value of our reporting units is compared to their carrying values 
if the fair values of the reporting units exceed the carrying value of the net assets  goodwill is not considered impaired and no further analysis is required 
if the carrying values of the net assets exceed the fair values of the reporting units  then the second step of the impairment test must be performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill 
if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  then an impairment loss equal to the difference would be recorded 
for  we conducted our annual goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of and concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the applicable reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
we regularly review our finite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets to determine if the carrying values are impaired 
a review is performed when an event occurs that may indicate the potential for impairment 
if indicators of impairment exist  we assess the recoverability of the affected finite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets by determining whether the carrying amount of such assets exceeds the undiscounted expected future cash flows associated with such assets 
if so  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 
non marketable equity securities as part of our strategic efforts to gain access to potential new products and technologies  we invest in a limited partnership investment fund that is accounted for under the equity method 
we periodically review our investment for impairment  however  the impairment analysis requires significant judgment in identifying events or circumstances that would likely have significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
the analysis may include assessment of the investee i revenue and earnings trend  ii business outlook for its products and technologies  iii liquidity position and the rate at which it is using its cash  and iv likelihood of obtaining subsequent rounds of financing 
if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying value  we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired 
we have experienced impairments due to the decline in the value of certain of our non marketable investments over the past few years 
income taxes income tax expense is based on pretax financial accounting income 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we must assess the likelihood that the resulting deferred tax assets will be realized 
to the extent we believe that realization is not more likely than not  we establish a valuation allowance 
significant estimates are required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets  and reserves for income tax related uncertainties 
some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations 
various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in overall levels  character  or geographical mix of pretax earnings  changes in tax laws  regulations and or rates  changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  levels of research and development spending  nondeductible expenses  applicability of tax holidays  ultimate outcomes of income tax audits  and income tax impacts of any business combination transactions or changes in our equity structure 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of december  was approximately million 
if recognized  the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact income tax expense is million 
as of december   we do not anticipate any material changes to the amount of unrecognized tax benefit during the next twelve months 
we classify interest and penalties related to tax positions as components of income tax expense 
for the year ended december   the amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax uncertainties was approximately million for a total cumulative amount of million of non current income taxes payable as of december  we file us federal  state  and foreign income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations 
in significant foreign jurisdictions  the through tax years generally remain subject to examination by their respective tax authorities 
contingencies we are subject to legal proceedings principally related to intellectual property matters 
based on the information available at the balance sheet dates  we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
if losses are probable and reasonably estimable  we will record a reserve which may change in the future due to new developments in each matter 
accounting for share based compensation we account for employee share based compensation by estimating the fair value of our employee stock awards  employee stock purchase plan awards and performance based restricted stock units at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the use of certain subjective assumptions 
the most significant of these assumptions are our estimates of the expected term  volatility and forfeiture rates of the awards 
the expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using a combination of historical and implied volatility of our common stock 
we determined that blended volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility 
the estimate of these key assumptions is based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends 
as required under the accounting rules  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  we are likely to change our valuation assumptions used to value employee share based awards granted in future periods 
us gaap requires that employee share based compensation costs be recognized over the requisite service period  or the vesting period  in a manner similar to all other forms of compensation paid to employees 
results of operations the following discussion compares the historical results of operations for the years ended december   and product sales the components of product sales are as follows dollars in thousands dollar percentage year ended december  change from change from consumables instruments total product sales excluding ebioscience revenue of million  product revenue for decreased by million or primarily due to lower genechip chips and reagents sales as a result of lower volume 
this decrease was partially offset by higher instrument revenue from clinical genechip scanner dx sales due to greater volumes partially offset by lower overall average selling price 
total product sales decreased in as compared to primarily due to volume decreases 
chip volumes shipped were lower across all products while overall average selling price remained flat 
reagent revenue decreased primarily due to lower volume genechip shipments combined with lower average selling price caused by a shift in product mix 
instruments were lower due to fewer genetitan sales partially offset by increased sales of the lower priced geneatlas 
services and other dollars in thousands dollar percentage year ended december  change from change from services and other services and other increased in as compared to primarily due to higher revenue from scientific services  partially offset by lower royalties revenue due to decreased royalties and research activities 
in  services and other was lower as compared to primarily due to a non recurring million license payment received in  as well as having lower overall royalties and research activities 
total revenue by business unit the following table summarizes total revenue by business unit dollars in thousands dollar percentage year ended december  change from change from affymetrix core reportable operating segment expression genetic analysis and clinical applications life science reagents ebioscience reportable operating segment ebioscience other corporate total revenue year ended december  affymetrix core reportable operating segment expression genetic analysis and clinical applications life science reagents ebioscience reportable operating segment ebioscience other corporate total revenue expression for the year ended december   expression revenue decreased by million primarily due to a decline in genechip revenue of million  which was driven by a lower volume of sales on our in vitro transcription ivt arrays 
the decline in expression revenue was partially offset by higher revenue from our quantigene and procarta line of products 
we expect expression to continue to decline as a percentage of our revenue portfolio in genetic analysis and clinical applications genetic analysis and clinical applications revenue increased million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  primarily due to increases in our cytogenetics products of million  axiom products of million and instruments of million 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in sales of our snp arrays of million 
revenue from clinical applications as a percentage of genetic analysis and clinical applications will continue to increase in life science reagents for the year ended december   life science reagents revenue decreased due to lower volume of sales 
corporate for the year ended december   corporate revenue decreased by million due to lower subscription revenue of million and royalties of million  partially offset by a net realized gain of million from designated cash flow hedges 
product and services gross margins dollars in thousands dollar point year ended december  change from total gross margin on product sales total gross margin on services and other product gross margin as a percentage of product sales service gross margin as a percentage of services and other product gross margin increased million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in primarily due to the inclusion of ebioscience product margins 
excluding ebioscience  product margin decreased due to lower product sales partially offset by decreased warranty  excess and obsolescence costs and favorable cost absorption in as compared to despite lower product sales in  product gross margin as a percentage of product sales increased during the year as compared to primarily due to a mix shift to higher margin products along with lower material  warranty and excess and obsolescence costs in as well as plant consolidation costs that occurred in these cost improvements were partially offset by lower cost absorption due to higher production levels in service and other gross margin as a percentage of services and other revenue decreased in as compared to primarily due to lower revenue from high margin royalties  partially offset by increased scientific services revenue 
was lower as compared to primarily due to lower revenue from royalties as a result of a non recurring license payment of million received in research and development expenses dollars in thousands dollar percentage year ended december  change from change from research and development research and development expenses decreased in and primarily due to savings in headcount related expenses and variable compensation of million and million  respectively 
the overall decrease in as compared to was partially offset by increased spending on chips  supplies and consulting and purchasing services totaling million 
results for also included million from ebioscience 
the overall decrease in as compared to was also due to decreased spending on supplies of million as a result of cost control measures  partially offset by an increase in facilities expenses primarily due to a one time expense of million related to the plant consolidation activities of our oakmead facility in santa clara during selling  general and administrative expenses dollars in thousands dollar percentage year ended december  change from change from selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased in as compared to due primarily to the acquisition of ebioscience which added an additional million in expenses and acquisition related costs totaling million in as compared to no expenses from ebioscience and million in acquisition related costs in excluding these costs  selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  primarily due to higher headcount related expenses of million due to shift from the use of temporary employees to full time employees  consulting and purchased services million due to greater use of consulting services  travel related expenses of million and advertising costs of million 
these increases were partially offset by lower spending on chips of million  decreased depreciation and amortization expenses due to assets becoming fully amortized of million and lower rent expenses of million 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in as compared to primarily due to lower legal expenses of million as a result of a litigation settlement at the end of other cost savings include variable compensation adjustments of million  lower spending on consulting and other services of million and advertising expenses of million 
these savings were partially offset by one time severance benefits provided to our former chief executive officer of million  rent expense of million primarily due to the acceleration of future lease payments as a result of the plant consolidation activities of our oakmead facility in santa clara and acquisition costs of million incurred on the anticipated ebioscience transaction 
restructuring expenses during the year ended december   we initiated a cost reduction action that included workforce  resulting in a charge of million related to employees who were notified prior to the end of we estimate that the total restructuring charge associated with the plan will be approximately million  substantially all of which is compensation and benefits afforded to terminated employees 
the remaining amount is expected to be recognized during the first quarter of interest income and other  net the components of interest income and other  net  are as follows dollars in thousands dollar percentage year ended december  change from change from interest income realized income loss on equity investments  net currency loss  net other total interest income and other  net interest income and other  net decreased in as compared to due to the following interest income decreased as we sold the majority of our available for sale securities in conjunction with the acquisition in the second quarter of  realized income loss on equity investments increased in as we recognized a net gain on sale of million on the liquidation of our available for sale securities while in  we recognized a total of million in other than temporary impairment otti on our non marketable investment in a limited partnership fund  a non marketable investment in a private biotechnology company and an investment classified as available for sale in a publicly traded company  currency loss  net  improved primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar against other foreign currency in as compared to  and in  other included a net million impairment loss on our west sacramento facility partially offset by the receipt of million for a note receivable from a private biotechnology company that was previously fully reserved for in and a gain of million on a disposal of an ebioscience product line 
we also recognized a million impairment charge against our west sacramento facility in interest income and other  net decreased in as compared to due to the following realized loss on equity investments decreased in as compared to as we recognized lower otti 
in  we recorded million in otti discussed above while in  we had million in otti on two non marketable investments  currency loss  net  increased primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar against the euro in as compared to  and other changed in due to the million provision against a note receivable and the million impairment charge recorded against our west sacramento facility discussed above 
interest expense dollars in thousands dollar percentage year ended december  change from change from interest expense interest expense increased in as compared to due to the long term debt obligations entered into as part of the acquisition 
the increase was partially offset by the repurchase of approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the notes during the first quarter of interest expense decreased in as compared to primarily due to a lower aggregate principal balance of our notes as a result of our repurchases totaling million in aggregate principal amount during income tax benefit provision dollars in thousands dollar percentage year ended december  change from change from income tax benefit provision the following discussion compares the historical results of operations for the years ended december   and the income tax benefit was approximately million in and consisted primarily of a million one time benefit resulting from a change in valuation allowance for our previously existing deferred tax assets as a result of the acquisition  offset by an income tax provision for foreign taxes 
the income tax provision was million and million in and  respectively  which consisted primarily of foreign taxes 
deferred tax assets are recognized if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
as of december   we provided for a valuation allowance of million against our net deferred tax assets 
as a result of negative evidence based on our cumulative net loss position  we have placed a full valuation allowance on us and certain foreign deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to assure realization of these tax benefits through future taxable income 
as of december   we had total net operating loss carryforwards of million  comprised of million for us federal purposes  which expire in the years through if not utilized  and million for state purposes  the majority of which expire in the years through if not utilized 
certain of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are subject to annual limitations due to the ownership change provisions under internal revenue code section and similar state provisions 
we do not expect the limitations to result in significant expirations of the net operating loss carryforwards before utilization 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity historically  we have financed our operations primarily through product sales  borrowings under credit arrangements  sales of equity and debt securities such as our and notes  collaborative agreements  interest income  and licensing of our technology 
our cash outflows have generally been as follows cash used in operating activities such as research and development programs  sales and marketing activity  compensation and benefits of our employees and other working capital needs  cash paid for acquisitions  cash paid for litigation activity and settlements  and cash used for the payment of principal on debt obligations and repurchases of our convertible notes as well as interest payments on our long term debt obligations 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale securities of approximately million 
we also have access  subject to compliance with certain covenants  to an additional million revolving credit facility  provided under our senior secured credit facility 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources along with the cash to be generated from operations will enable us to maintain currently planned operations  debt repayments or convertible notes repurchases  and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
these expectations are based on our current operating and financing plans  which are subject to change  and therefore we could require further funding 
factors that may cause us to require additional funding may include  but are not limited to costs associated with defending third party claims  adverse ruling in any of our current litigation proceedings  investments required to commercialize our products  investments required to upgrade our older product lines  a decline in cash generated by sales of our products and services  our ability to maintain existing collaborative and customer arrangements and establish and maintain new collaboration and customer arrangements  arrangements that we may enter into in connection with future acquisitions  the progress of our research and development programs  initiation or expansion of research programs and collaborations  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting and enforcing intellectual property rights  the purchase of patent licenses  and other factors 
on june   we completed our acquisition of ebioscience for approximately million  representing the purchase price of million less million cash transferred from ebioscience 
the acquisition was financed through a combination of cash on hand  the liquidation of available for sale securities  the proceeds  net of debt issuance costs  from our term loan of million provided under our senior secured credit facility and the proceeds from the issuance  net of underwriting fees  of our notes of million 
during the year ended december   we made million of cash payments for legal  advisory and other costs related to the acquisition 
as part of the terms of the senior secured credit facility  we are required to meet certain financial and other negative covenants 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants and currently anticipate that we will be in compliance through the foreseeable future 
refer to note long term debt obligations for further details regarding the term loan  our senior secured credit facility and the notes 
from time to time  we may seek to retire  repurchase or exchange common stock or convertible notes in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions dependent on market conditions  liquidity  and contractual obligations and other factors 
we did not retire  repurchase or exchange any of our common stock during the year ended december  during the first quarter of  we repurchased approximately million of aggregate principal amount of our notes at par plus accrued and unpaid interest for total cash consideration of million  including accrued interest of million 
in january  we redeemed the remaining million of outstanding aggregate aggregate principal amount of our notes at par plus accrued and unpaid interest of million 
cashflow in thousands year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities effect of foreign currency translation on cash and cash equivalents net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was comprised of net loss of million  non cash charges of million and a decrease in operating assets of million 
adjustments for non cash expenses include depreciation and amortization expense of million  including million of amortization on the fair value step up of inventory  share based compensation expense of million that includes a non recurring share based compensation expense of million related to the accelerated vesting of ebioscience stock options  an income tax benefit of million that includes the release of valuation allowance of million related to the acquisition and a million impairment on our west sacramento facility that was sold during the year 
cash used in accounts payable and accrued liabilities include certain non recurring activity relating to the acquisition  including million cash payments for legal  advisory and other costs related to the acquisition 
investing activities as discussed above  during the second quarter of  we completed our acquisition of ebioscience for million in cash considerations 
the acquisition was partially funded through the proceeds from sales of available for sale securities of million 
other investing activities for the year ended december  included capital expenditures of million and purchases of technology rights of million 
we monitor the level of cash and cash equivalents as compared to available for sale securities to manage the return on funds 
management of our portfolio and sale of securities for purposes of funding the acquisition resulted in net sales of available for sale securities during the investments were partially offset by million in proceeds from the sale of our west sacramento facility 
in late  the company initiated a cost reduction action that included workforce 
in january  approximately employees were notified of their involuntary termination 
the company estimates that the total restructuring charge associated with the plan will be approximately million  substantially all of which is compensation and benefits afforded to terminated employees 
the restructuring charges will be recognized during the first quarter of in selling  general and administrative expenses except for million related to employees who were notified prior to december  and recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  the company anticipates substantially all of the cash expenditures will be released during the first quarter of see item financial statements and supplementary data note restructuring in this annual report on form k

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate  interest rate and equity price risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations 
our risk management strategy with respect to these three market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments 
we use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures of affymetrix 
accordingly  we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes 
our risks  risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair values for each of these exposures are outlined below 
actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate and equity price movements and our actual exposures and hedges 
interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we maintain investments at an average maturity of less than three years

this exposes us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we purchase foreign exchange option contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows related to forecasted revenues denominated in certain foreign currencies 
the objective of the foreign exchange contracts is to better ensure that the us dollar equivalent cash flows are not adversely affected by changes in the us dollar or foreign currency exchange rates 
these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges 
the gain or loss on the effective portion of a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income oci and subsequently reclassified into revenues when the hedged revenues are recorded or as interest and other income  net  if the hedged transaction becomes probable of not occurring 
any gain or loss after a hedge is de designated or related to an ineffective portion of a hedge is recognized as interest and other income  net  immediately
