recent developments drilling activities on june   the ru sidetrack ru a well was completed and was successfully brought online 
after clearing the well of drilling fluids from the sidetrack  a subsequent well test showed an initial daily production rate ip of  barrels of oil per day bopd and a water cut of 
ru a is one of five planned sidetracks to be completed on the osprey platform 
the original ru well  drilled by a previous operator  produced approximately  barrels before it suffered casing damage caused by a poor completion design 
after assessing the deficiencies that resulted in the sub optimal production and eventful catastrophic well failure  we re engineered the drilling and completion to achieve optimal oil recovery on re entry 
ru a was sidetracked from the original ru well starting at a depth of approximately  feet and drilled to a measured depth of  feet 
the completed well has a new bottom hole located feet higher on structure than the original ru well 
we are currently drilling olson creek with rig upon completion  we plan to move rig to deepen the otter prospect  which discovered the presence of reservoir quality sands and strong gas shows earlier this year

alaska region overview the cook inlet basin contains large oil and gas deposits including multiple offshore fields 
in there were platforms in the cook inlet  the oldest of which is the xto a platform first installed by royal dutch shell plc in  and the newest of which is the osprey platform installed by forest oil corporation in and acquired by us in december southcentral alaska has a well developed oil and gas pipeline infrastructure to bring cook inlet oil and gas to market 
this system is isolated from the main north american gas pipeline system 
much of the value added hydrocarbon processing occurs on the east side of cook inlet in an industrial cluster located in nikiski  which is the northern part of the city of kenai 
the tesoro refinery  conocophillips lng plant  bp gtl plant  agrium  inc fertilizer plant  and numerous docks  tanks and pipelines are all located in nikiski 
the susitna basin is a large area to the north of anchorage in southcentral alaska 
it is perhaps best known for its coal seams in the sedimentary basin that lies underneath the basin and could become a new source of much needed natural gas 
cook inlet and susitna basins the cook inlet is a vast estuary stretching miles from the gulf of alaska to anchorage in southcentral alaska 
the inlet separates the kenai peninsula in the east from the alaska peninsula in the west 
the cook inlet basin underlying this region contains large oil and gas deposits including several offshore fields 
there are also numerous oil and gas pipelines located in and 
table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share and per unit data under the cook inlet 
the cook inlet basin has produced approximately billion barrels of oil and trillion cubic feet tcf of natural gas 
the susitna basin underlies the sprawling susitna river valley to the north of anchorage 
the susitna basin lies directly north of the cook inlet basin  separated by the castle mountain fault  and has similar geology 
while the cook inlet basin is a historic region of oil and gas production  there is not currently commercial production of oil or gas from the susitna basin 
in its assessment of undiscovered oil and gas resources of the cook inlet region  the united states geologic survey usgs estimated mean undiscovered technically recoverable reserves of million bbls of oil and tcf of natural gas 
all of the undiscovered oil and tcf of the undiscovered gas are conventional resources  and tcf of natural gas was estimated to be technically recoverable as coal bed methane 
this report considered the full oil and gas potential of the cook inlet basin  but only the coal bed methane potential of the susitna basin 
these numbers do not include oil and gas remaining to be produced in currently producing fields 
as of april  and  we owned approximately  and  gross acres of leasehold interests  the exploration license rights to an additional  acres and interests in crude oil and five natural gas wells 
the reduction in leased acreage from april  is a result of the expiration of three leases 
at the time we acquired the alaskan operations  all ten oil wells  four of five gas wells and four injection wells were shut in 
as of april   four oil wells and five gas wells are producing 
in addition  we own a working interest in two gas wells operated by aurora gas  which have been operated continuously 
oil wells drilled in this area range from  feet to  feet in vertical depth while gas wells have a vertical depth of  feet to  feet 
wells that are deviated continue on from the vertical depth either diagonally or horizontally will have a longer measured depth of approximately  feet to  feet or more giving measured depth of up to  feet or more 
well spacing is quite variable  as there are large parts of cook inlet which are completely undeveloped and others that are more mature 
our fields have approximately acre spacing 
the cook inlet basin contains a thick section of terrestrial tertiary rocks which includes shale  sandstone  and coal 
the primary targets in the area are crude oil reserves  but prolific gas fields are increasingly attractive due to the rising price of gas in the alaska market and liquefied natural gas lng 
cook inlet natural gas is strategically situated to provide lng to asian markets where the lng price is high and rising 
osprey platform and redoubt shoals field the osprey platform is located in the redoubt unit approximately miles southeast of west foreland in central cook inlet at a water depth of approximately feet 
the osprey platform  which produces from the redoubt shoals field is connected to our kustatan production facility 
it relies on our kustatan production facility and our west mcarthur river unit production facility to provide all of its electricity and gas  and on the kustatan production facility to process all of osprey produced fluids 
the platform has available slots  eight of which are currently used  and an attached man camp 
after a period of inactivity  we started work to re commission osprey in february and restored production in may the osprey platform was placed on site in june and initially used to conduct exploration drilling operations between january and july eight wells were drilled  which in their present configuration consist of one water flood well  one class i injection well  and six oil wells 
the oil wells were equipped with electrical submersible pumps esps which were necessary to bring the oil to the surface 
in  the third party drilling rig was removed from the platform after a contract dispute 
the removal of the rig delayed the ability to maintain and repair the platform wells or to expand production  and the osprey platform was shut in in the spring of in order to restore production from the redoubt unit  it was necessary to mobilize a drilling rig to the osprey platform to repair the shut in wells 
two of the wells required replacement of the esps  and the other four wells required re drilling in sections 
due to significant drilling rig rental cost and delays associated with mobilization and availability of a drilling rig sufficient in size and power to repair the wells  we determined it was most effective to permanently locate a drilling rig on the osprey platform 
in march  we transitioned the osprey platform out of lighthouse mode and successfully repaired the first of the two wells needing esp replacement  of which one later failed in september as a result of successive pump failure 
in june  we contracted with voorhees equipment and consulting  inc for the custom construction and purchase of rig for  we successfully mobilized all components of the custom rig to the osprey platform in late december assembly of the rig began as parts were delivered to the platform 
in january  the region experienced prolonged  near record cold weather  which caused us to temporarily delay rig assembly efforts due to safety concerns 
the cold weather also led to significant generation of ice volume in the cook inlet and made shipping and the operation of work boats very limited 
as warmer temperatures moderated the region and rig contractor and supplies were in order  we resumed work on the assembly of rig  which was brought online in august rig has since replaced pumps in oil wells ru and ru  sidetracked oil well ru a and completed the reworking of the ru and the ru gas wells 
we were unable to optimize the performance of ru due to obstructions which were stuck in the lower part of the well bore 
we are currently performing a side track on this well bore 

table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share and per unit data kustatan production facility the kustatan production facility was constructed in by forest oil corporation to process an estimated  bopd 
processing capabilities are expandable to  bopd 
the facility provides power and processes hydrocarbons produced from our offshore osprey platform 
west mcarthur river field and production facility the west mcarthur river facility processes oil and gas from the west mcarthur river field and has the ability to process gas from the west foreland field 
currently  there are three producing wells in the field 
the facility was built in s to process approximately  bopd 
west foreland field and production facility the west foreland field is produced through the west foreland facility but can be processed through the west mcarthur river facility 
currently  there are three wells in the field  one of which is off line 
the west foreland facility is tied into the gas pipeline network including sales gas pipelines 
three mile creek field the three mile creek field is operated by aurora gas 
there are two gas wells in which we own a working interest in this field 
susitna basin included in the alaskan operations we acquired is a interest in susitna basin exploration license no 
 granted by the state of alaska in october covering approximately  acres in the susitna basin area north of anchorage 
under the terms of the exploration license  the licensee was granted a seven year exclusive license to explore for oil and gas on the specified lands  and upon fulfillment of the work commitment  the license for all or any part of the land could be converted into oil and gas leases 
the original work commitment of approximately  was fulfilled 
in an effort to control the timing of the development of this acreage  in april we requested a three year extension of the exploration license for a work commitment of the state granted the extension in october we will have the right to convert all or any portion of the licensed acreage into oil and gas leases upon completion of the new work commitment 
we currently have a performance bond of toward fulfilling its work commitment  and will need to post additional bonds annually if no work is carried out in the licensed area 
the susitna basin exploration license no 
is set to expire on october  and we expect to have fulfilled our work commitment obligation by such date 
we will evaluate whether to convert all or any part of the license to leases at such time 
on april   we were awarded susitna basin exploration license no 
 which consists of  acres 
it granted us an exclusive ten year license to explore for oil and gas on the specified lands

assignment oversight agreement on november   cie entered into an assignment oversight agreement aoa with the alaska department of natural resources alaska dnr which set out certain terms under which the alaska dnr would approve the transfer of oil and gas leases owned by the state of alaska from pacific energy to cie 
this agreement remains in place following our acquisition of cie in december generally  the agreement requires cie to provide the alaska dnr with additional information and oversight authority to ensure that cie is acting diligently to develop the oil and gas from redoubt and west mcarthur river units wmru 
under the terms of the aoa  until the alaska dnr determines that cie has completed certain development and operational commitments relating to the wmru and redoubt units  cie must do the following  in addition to the normal requirements under the terms of the leases file a monthly summary of expenditures by oil and gas field  tied to objectives in cie business plan and plan of development previously presented to the alaska dnr  file a quarterly summary of expenditures by oil and gas field  tied to objectives in cie business plan and plan of development previously presented to the alaska dnr  meet monthly with the alaska dnr to provide an update on operations and progress towards meeting these objectives  
table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share and per unit data notify the alaska dnr days prior to commitment when cie is preparing to spend funds on a purchase  project or item relating to the wmru or redoubt leases of more than  annually submit a new plan of development for the alaska dnr approval 
the aoa required cie to demonstrate funding commitments of  to support the redevelopment of the wmru and an estimated  to support the development of the redoubt unit 
the company believes it has adequately fulfilled these commitments 
on march   the company entered into a performance bond agreement under its aoa with the state of alaska 
under the performance bond agreement  the company is required to post a total bond of  for the dismantling and abandonment of the properties 
as agreed with the state of alaska  the performance bond agreement fulfills our commitment under the aoa to fund the full dismantlement costs with respect to our onshore and offshore assets 
the performance bond agreement also stipulated that  held by the state in an escrow account will be credited towards the  as a result  the company recorded a  gain on acquisition inclusive of accrued interest during the year ended april  the aoa also prohibits cie from using proceeds from operation at wmru or redoubt for non core oil and gas activities  or activities unrelated to wmru or redoubt  without the prior written approval of the alaska dnr until the parties mutually agree that the full dismantlement obligation under the assigned leases is funded 
failure to submit the information required by the aoa or expenditure of proceeds from wmru or redoubt for items or activities unrelated to core oil and gas activities at wmru or redoubt would constitute a default under the aoa 
if the default could not be cured within days  the leases would be subject to termination by the alaska dnr

appalachian region we are the largest owner operator of oil and natural gas wells in tennessee 
as of april   we owned approximately  gross acres of leasehold interests with producing oil wells and producing gas wells in which we own an interest 
this is an increase of  gross acres  oil wells and gas wells from april  wells drilled within our acreage range from approximately  to  feet in depth with major targets in descending order being the mississippian age monteagle limestone and fort payne limestone  and the devonian age chattanooga shale  with the fort payne limestone being the primary oil target 
during fiscal  miller focused its emphasis on continuing the purchase of working interests in wells in order to increase the number of wells in which we own an interest  thus increasing production 
in addition we focused on reworks of older producing wells  and drilling horizontal wells in the mississippian age fort payne limestone 
with the strategic purchases of 
table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share and per unit data working interests  reworks  and drilling new wells  net oil production in tennessee increased from bbls per day at april  to bbls per day at april  gas production has stayed flat due to restrictions on gas sales in the area 
in january  we drilled and completed the first successful horizontal oil well in the fort payne limestone in tennessee 
this well has confirmed the viability of this type of drilling technique in the mississippian age limestone formations in tennessee 
we are presently producing from this well  and since the well is a first of its kind we are experimenting with various production techniques 
miller drilled a second horizontal well in the fort payne limestone and we are still in the completion phase of this well 
this drilling and production method  along with gas pressure maintenance  will enable us to maximize the oil potential in tennessee 
we have acreage in and around previously producing fields and plan to utilize our expertise to enhance present production and extract additional oil from areas previously overlooked 
currently  within the acreage controlled by us  there are numerous potential well locations that can be drilled and produced 
in addition  we will continue to pursue a pressure maintenance program and natural gas storage within the mississippian age fort payne limestone 
miller has millions of cubic feet of gas shut in and behind pipe in tennessee 
with the price of natural gas moving upward  we plan on moving forward to secure markets for this gas 
in addition to the gas shut in and behind pipe  the devonian age chattanooga shale underlies acreage controlled by us and is a candidate for horizontal gas wells in the future 
principal markets and customers the existing markets for natural gas production in southcentral alaska are the tesoro nikiski refinery  utility companies  petrochemical manufacturing  the production of lng for export to asian markets  and the production of synthetic crude oil syncrude 
presently  our sole market for crude oil produced from our alaskan operations is the tesoro nikiski refinery 
crude oil is shipped by pipeline and tanker vessel to the tesoro nikiski refinery  operated by tesoro alaska petroleum company tesoro 
under the terms of the alaska crude oil sales contract  tesoro has agreed to purchase all crude oil produced by us  subject to a minimum of bbls day and a maximum of  bbls day 
should the quantity of oil produced by us fall below the minimum or rise above the maximum  the contract would be open for renegotiation 
the price for each delivery of oil shall be equal to the simple arithmetic average of the published daily nymex wti for the applicable front month nymex contract published each business day in the calendar month of delivery  subject to certain adjustments i if the ans index midpoint price is at least bbl greater than the wti index price  then the price shall be equal to the ans index midpoint price less bbl  ii if the ans index midpoint price is equal to or less than the sum of the wti index price plus bbl  then the price shall be equal to the wti index price less bbl  iii less a deduction for the cispri  iv less a deduction for transportation through the kenai pipeline  v less a deduction for transportation and shipping  and  vi less a deduction adjusting for redoubt shoal quality 
non redoubt shoal oil will have an additional quality adjustment 
we are also responsible for paying taxes on the sale  production or handling of the oil prior to delivery 
the contract may be opened for renegotiation if the quality of the oil changes  certain volume reductions or increases  changes to the cispri charges  or closure of the company alaska refinery 
in fiscal  and  purchases by tesoro accounted for   and  respectively  of our total alaska oil and gas production revenues 
currently  approximately mmcfd to mmcfd of natural gas produced by our alaskan operations is used to generate heat and power at our production facilities 
in the near future  gas production in excess of our internal needs will be sold to third parties  as all of our gas wells are connected to the southcentral alaska railbelt pipeline network through the cook inlet gas gathering system and or the beluga pipeline  both of which are operated by hilcorp alaska  llc and its affiliates 
the principal markets for our crude oil and natural gas produced in the appalachian region are refining companies  utility companies and private industry end users 
crude oil is stored in tanks at the well site until the purchaser retrieves it by tank truck 
direct purchases of our crude oil are made by barrett oil purchasing company  sunoco  and kentucky oil and refining company 
our natural gas has multiple markets throughout the eastern united states through gas transmission lines 
access to these markets is presently provided by three companies in northeastern tennessee cumberland valley resources  nami resources company  and tengasco 
local markets in tennessee are served by citizens gas utility district and the powell clinch utility district 
natural gas is delivered to the purchaser via gathering lines into the main gas transmission line 
surplus gas is placed in storage facilities or transported to east tennessee natural gas which serves tennessee and virginia 
in fiscal  and  sales to barrett oil purchasing and sunoco  collectively  represented approximately   and  respectively  of our total tennessee oil and gas revenues 
drilling statistics historically  our drilling activities have generally concentrated on the recompletion of wells in the cook inlet region and the exploitation and extension of existing producing fields in the appalachian region 
in fiscal  we transitioned our efforts 
table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share and per unit data to the construction of a custom rig for the osprey platform  rig  with the anticipation that it will restore all previously producing wells on the platform 
during fiscal and early fiscal  we have used rig to restore or commence production from oil wells ru  ru and ru a and gas wells ru and ru rig is currently being used to sidetrack the ru oil well 
we also made significant improvements and modifications to one of our rigs  rig  to enable onshore drilling in winter conditions while complying with alaska regulations 
upon certification from the alaska oil and gas conservation commission aogcc in march  we mobilized rig to the kustatan gas field to workover the kf well  a previously producing gas well  and to the otter prospect in april to begin drilling the otter well 
rig is currently working on the olson creek well  which was spudded on june  in  we incurred dry hole costs on one well in tennessee 
in tennessee  we drilled two new development wells  one well that is producing and one well that is classified non producing as of the year end 
in  we explored two new zones in our kf well in alaska that were unproductive

gross and net undeveloped and developed acreage our staff of professional geologists utilizes results from logs  seismic data and other tools to evaluate existing wells and to predict the location of economically attractive new natural gas and oil reserves 
to further this process  we have collected and continue to collect logs  core data  production information and other raw data available from state and private agencies and other companies and individuals actively drilling in the regions being evaluated 
from this information  the geologists develop models of the subsurface structures and formations that are used to predict areas for prospective economic development 
on the basis of these models  we obtain available natural gas and oil leaseholds  farm outs and other development rights in these prospective areas 
in most cases  to secure a lease  we pay a lease bonus and an annual rental payment  converting to a royalty upon initial production 
in addition  overriding royalty payments may be granted to third parties in conjunction with the acquisition of drilling rights initially leased by others 
we believe that we hold good and defensible title to our developed properties  in accordance with standards generally accepted in the industry 
as is customary in the industry  a preliminary title examination is conducted at the time the undeveloped properties are acquired 
prior to the commencement of drilling operations  a title examination is conducted and remedial work is performed with respect to discovered defects which we deem to be significant 
title examinations have been performed with respect to substantially all of our producing properties 
certain of the properties we own are subject to royalty  overriding royalty and other outstanding interests customary to the industry 
the properties may also be subject to additional burdens  liens or encumbrances customary to the industry  including items such as operating agreements  current taxes  development obligations under natural gas and oil leases  farm out agreements and other restrictions 
we do not believe that any of these burdens will materially interfere with the use of the properties

we provide information on two types of proved reserves developed and undeveloped 
proved developed reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods and proved undeveloped reserves are reasonably certain reserves in drilling units immediately adjacent to the drilling unit containing a producing well  as well as areas beyond one offsetting drilling unit from a producing well 

table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share and per unit data unproved reserves are based on geological and or engineering data similar to that used in estimates of proved reserves  but technical  contractual  or regulatory uncertainties preclude such reserves being classified as proved 
they are sub classified as probable and possible 
probable reserves are attributed to known accumulations and usually claim a confidence level of recovery 
possible reserves are attributed to known accumulations that have a less likely chance of being recovered than probable reserves 
this term is often used for reserves which are claimed to have at least a certainty of being produced 
reasons for classifying reserves as possible include varying interpretations of geology  reserves not producible at commercial rates  uncertainty due to reserve infill  and projected reserves based on future recovery methods

we provide the engineering firms with estimate preparation material such as property interests  production  current operation costs  current production prices and other information 
this 
table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share and per unit data information is reviewed by the chief executive officer of cie and our acting chief financial officer prior to submission to our third party engineering firm 
letters which identify the professional qualifications of each of the independent engineering firms who prepared the reserve reports are included in those reserve reports which are filed as exhibits to this annual report 
there was no conversion of unproved reserves to proved reserves during the fiscal year ended april  other ancillary services we also generate ancillary revenues from facility rentals  services and drilling activities 
while the facilities  equipment and personnel on hand are for the benefit of servicing and drilling our own properties  from time to time we optimize unused capacity by renting space and performing services and drilling on behalf of third parties

in fiscal and  and  respectively  of our other revenue related to a plugging project for the us department of interior in tennessee 
competitive conditions our oil and gas exploration activities in alaska and tennessee are undertaken in a highly competitive and speculative business environment 
in seeking any other suitable oil and gas properties for acquisition  we compete with a number of other companies doing business in alaska  tennessee and elsewhere  including large oil and gas companies and other independent operators  many with greater financial resources than we have 
at the local level  as we seek to expand our lease holdings  we compete with several companies who are also seeking to acquire leases in the areas of the acreage which we have under lease 
in alaska  we have nine significant competitors consisting of apache corporation  aurora gas  buccaneer alaska  hilcorp  conocophillips  furie  xto  linc energy  and nordaq 
however  we believe we can effectively compete because we already have existing oil and gas production  facilities  infrastructure  and pipelines that connect us to the oil and gas markets 
we believe that our existing alaska oil and gas reserves and current leases with large acreage positions enhance our competitive position within the area and will enable us to compete effectively for additional lease acreage with our competitors 
in the appalachian region  we have five significant competitors consisting of atlas energy resources  llc  consol energy  inc  can argo energy corporation  champ oil  and tengasco  inc these companies are in competition with us for oil and gas leases in known producing areas in which we currently operate  as well as other potential areas of interest 
we have more than years of experience in the appalachian region and are the largest operator of oil and gas wells in tennessee 
government regulation while the prices of oil and natural gas are set by the market  other aspects of our business and the industry in general are heavily regulated 
the availability of a ready market for oil production and natural gas depends on several factors beyond our control 
these factors include regulation of production  federal and state regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control  the amount of oil and natural gas available for sale  the availability of adequate pipeline and other transportation and processing facilities and the marketing of competitive fuels 
state and federal regulations generally are intended to protect consumers from unfair treatment and oppressive control  to reduce the risk to the public and workers from the drilling  completion  production and transportation of oil and natural gas  to prevent waste of oil and natural gas  to protect rights among owners in a common reservoir and to control contamination of the environment 
pipelines are subject to the jurisdiction of various federal  state and local agencies 
our exploration and production business is subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations on the taxation of natural gas and oil  the development  production and marketing of natural gas and oil and environmental and safety matters 
many laws and regulations require drilling permits and govern the spacing of wells  rates of production  water discharge  prevention of waste and other matters 
prior to commencing drilling activities for a well  we must procure permits and or approvals for the various stages of the drilling process from the applicable state and local agencies in the state in which the area to be drilled is located 
the permits and approvals include those for the drilling of wells 
additionally  other regulated matters include the following bond requirements in order to drill or operate wells  the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the surface use and restoration of well properties  the plugging and abandoning of wells  and the disposal of fluids 
the regulatory commission of alaska regulates the intrastate pipeline tariffs and encompasses all pipelines cie ships through including the cook inlet pipeline company cipl  ciggs  and beluga lines 
the regulatory commission of alaska must also review and approve most major long term gas sales contracts to public utilities  and through this mechanism plays the 
table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share and per unit data dominant role in determining gas pricing  since alaska has no spot market for gas 
southcentral alaska gas is typically sold under long or short term contracts as opposed to a spot market 
for the purposes of reasonably valuing gas reserves  therefore  future gas production is assumed to be sold at contract terms comparable to similarly situated producers 
cie has posted in alaska and federal bonds 
the alaska dnr requires in bonding to operate oil and gas leases on state lands  and the aogcc requires a bond to drill wells in the state 
these bonds are fully funded and are held by the first national bank of alaska in certificates of deposit for benefit of the various beneficiaries 
cie has a total of in designated accounts to satisfy future abandonment obligations 
a letter of credit is established for two class non hazardous injection wells for benefit of the united states environmental protection agency epa 
this letter of credit is backed by an account which must maintain a minimum value of under the terms of the bankruptcy sale of the pacific energy assets  cie was obligated to establish accounts to cover abandonment obligations to cook inlet region  inc ciri  salamatof native association salamatof  and the state of alaska  was required to cover future abandonment expenses related to the three west foreland gas wells for benefit of ciri  all of which has been funded 
an additional is for future abandonment expenses associated with surface facilities and pipelines for benefit of ciri and salamatof  none of which has yet been funded 
in march  cie entered into a performance bond agreement that set the bond for the osprey platform at an inflation adjusted  the agreement sets a payment schedule totaling  in annual payments between july and july an existing interest bearing account containing approximately  as of april  is to be credited against the inflation adjusted  liability 
annual payments will be made after as necessary to the degree that inflation has caused the liability to increase over the amount contained in the funded accounts 
under the oil pollution act of  cie is required to fund a citizens advisory group  the cook inlet regional citizen advisory council  under which its commitment is approximately per year 
tennessee law requires that we obtain state permits for the drilling of oil and gas wells and to post a bond with the tennessee oil and gas board to ensure that each well is reclaimed and properly plugged when it is abandoned 
the reclamation bonds cost  per well 
the cost for the plugging bonds range from  to  per well depending on depth or  for ten wells 
currently  we have several old blanket plugging bonds which covers up to wells 
for most of the reclamation bonds  we have deposited a certificate of deposit with the tennessee oil and gas board 
sales of natural gas in tennessee are affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation 
beginning in  the federal energy regulatory commission ferc  which sets the rates and charges for transportation and sale of natural gas  adopted regulatory changes that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas 
the stated purpose of ferc changes is to promote competition among the various sectors of the natural gas industry 
in  ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation  subject to certain conditions and limitations 
these regulations may tend to increase the cost of transporting oil and natural gas by pipeline 
every five years  ferc will examine the relationship between the change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced by the industry 
we are not able to predict with certainty what effect  if any  these regulations will have on us 
the state and regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry generally increases our cost of doing business and affects our profitability 
while we believe we are presently in compliance with all applicable federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations  continued compliance or failure to comply and future legislation may have an adverse impact on our present and contemplated business operations 
because such federal and state regulations are amended or reinterpreted frequently  we are unable to predict with certainty the future cost or impact of complying with these laws 
we are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment  such as the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of  as amended cercla  the resource conservation and recovery act rcra  the clean air act  and the federal water pollution control act of the clean water act  which affect our operations and costs 
in particular  our exploration  development and production operations  our activities in connection with storage and transportation of oil and other hydrocarbons and our use of facilities for treating  processing or otherwise handling hydrocarbons and related wastes may be subject to regulation under these and similar state legislation 
these laws and regulations restrict the types  quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities  limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness  wetlands and other protected areas  and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations 
cercla  also known as superfund  imposes liability for response costs and damages to natural resources  without regard to fault or the legality of the original act  on some classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance 
table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share and per unit data into the environment 
these persons include the owner or operator of a disposal site and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site 
cercla also authorizes the epa and  in some instances  third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur 
it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment 
in the course of our ordinary operations  we may generate waste that may fall within cercla definition of a hazardous substance 
we may be jointly and severally liable under cercla or comparable state statutes for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these wastes have been disposed 
we currently lease properties that for many years have been used for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas 
although we have used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed or released on  under or from the properties owned or leased by us or on  under or from other locations where these wastes have been taken for disposal 
in addition  many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose actions with respect to the treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under our control 
these properties and wastes disposed on these properties may be subject to cercla and analogous state laws 
under these laws  we could be required to do the following remove or remediate previously disposed wastes  including wastes disposed or released by prior owners or operators  and or clean up contaminated property  including contaminated groundwater  or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination 
at this time  we do not believe that we are associated with any superfund site and we have not been notified of any claim  liability or damages under cercla 
the rcra is the principal federal statute governing the treatment  storage and disposal of hazardous wastes 
rcra imposes stringent operating requirements and liability for failure to meet such requirements on a person who is either a generator or transporter of hazardous waste or an owner or operator of a hazardous waste treatment  storage or disposal facility 
at present  rcra includes a statutory exemption that allows most oil and natural gas exploration and production waste to be classified as nonhazardous waste 
a similar exemption is contained in many of the state counterparts to rcra 
as a result  we are not required to comply with a substantial portion of rcra requirements because our operations generate minimal quantities of hazardous wastes 
at various times in the past  proposals have been made to amend rcra to rescind the exemption that excludes oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes from regulation as hazardous waste 
repeal or modification of the exemption by administrative  legislative or judicial process  or modification of similar exemptions in applicable state statutes  would increase the volume of hazardous waste we are required to manage and dispose of and would cause us to incur increased operating expenses 
the clean water act imposes restrictions and controls on the discharge of produced waters and other wastes into navigable waters 
permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state and federal waters and to conduct construction activities in waters and wetlands 
the clean water act requires us to construct a fresh water containment barrier between the surface of each drilling site and the underlying water table 
this involves constructing pit s and inserting heavy gauge plastic in the pit s in order to keep any drilling fluids and or oil from escaping the drill site and contaminating the ground water and or any navigable waters 
certain state regulations and the general permits issued under the federal national pollutant discharge elimination system program prohibit the discharge of produced waters and sand  drilling fluids  drill cuttings and certain other substances related to the oil and natural gas industry into certain coastal and offshore waters 
further  the epa has adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain permits for storm water discharges 
costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans 
the clean water act and comparable state statutes provide for civil  criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges for oil and other pollutants and impose liability on parties responsible for those discharges for the costs of cleaning up any environmental damage caused by the release and for natural resource damages resulting from the release 
we believe that our operations comply in all material respects with the requirements of the clean water act and state statutes enacted to control water pollution 
our operations are also subject to laws and regulations requiring removal and cleanup of environmental damages under certain circumstances 
laws and regulations protecting the environment have generally become more stringent in recent years  and may in certain circumstances impose strict liability  rendering a corporation liable for environmental damages without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such corporation 
such laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of operations or conditions caused by others  or for acts which may have been in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed 
the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share and per unit data in addition  our existing and proposed operations could result in liability for fires  blowouts  oil spills  discharge of hazardous materials into surface and subsurface aquifers and other environmental damage  any one of which could result in personal injury  loss of life  property damage or destruction or suspension of operations 
we have an emergency action and environmental response policy program in place 
this program details the appropriate response to any emergency that management believes to be possible in our area of operations 
we believe we are presently in compliance with all applicable federal and state environmental laws  rules and regulations  however  continued compliance or failure to comply and future legislation may have an adverse impact on our present and contemplated business operations 
employees on april   we had employees 
offices our principal executive offices are located at cogdill road  suite  knoxville  tennessee 
at april   we maintained regional exploration and or production offices in huntsville and sunbright  tennessee and anchorage  alaska 
we lease all of our primary administrative offices in knoxville  tennessee and anchorage  alaska

our history we were formed in delaware in november in january  we acquired miller petroleum  inc  a privately held company controlled by mr 
deloy miller  our chairman  in a reverse merger in which miller petroleum  inc was the accounting survivor 
in conjunction with this transaction  we changed our name to miller petroleum  inc and re domesticated to the state of tennessee 
from to  we focused our operations on our existing acreage in the state of tennessee 
during this time  we participated in a joint venture with wind city oil gas  llc wind city  which resulted in the drilling of ten successful natural gas wells on our koppers  lindsay  and harriman acreage 
however  a dispute arose between wind city and us as to the winding up of the joint venture  and it was ultimately resolved after we were able to sell some of the acreage to atlas energy resources  llc atlas  in the atlas transaction was subject to unwinding pursuant to a pending litigation between our company and cnx gas company  llc as disclosed in item legal proceedings 
in august  we hired scott m 
boruff as our chief executive officer  and began to look for opportunities to expand our acreage and operations by acquiring other businesses and forming strategic partnerships with other exploration and production companies 
during mr 
boruff tenure as ceo  we have acquired the assets of one company  and acquired sole ownership of three companies 
the first acquisition under mr 
boruff leadership was the kto transaction in which we acquired certain oil and gas properties in exchange for  shares of our common stock valued at shortly thereafter  we acquired etc  in exchange for an aggregate of  shares of our common stock valued at in march  we formed miller energy gp and in april we formed miller energy income a  lp mei 
mei was organized to provide the capital required to invest in various types of oil and gas ventures including the acquisition of oil and gas leases  royalty interests  overriding royalty interests  working interests  mineral interests  real estate  producing and non producing wells  reserves  oil and gas related equipment including transportation lines and potential investments in entities that invest in such assets except for other investment partnerships sponsored by affiliates of mei 
through a subsidiary we own of mei  however due to the shared management of our company and mei  we consolidate this entity 
the third acquisition significantly expanded our operations  assets  and reserves  and took us into a new geographic area 
on december   we acquired of the membership interests in cie in exchange for four year stock warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at exercise prices ranging from to per share and in cash to satisfy certain expenses as well as reimbursement for reasonable out of pocket expenses 
following the transaction  mr 
david hall was appointed as a member of our board of directors and as chief executive officer of cie 
immediately prior to our acquisition of cie  cie acquired  through a delaware chapter bankruptcy proceeding  the former alaskan operations of pacific energy 
the purchased operations included the west mcarthur river oil field  the west foreland natural gas field  the redoubt field and related osprey offshore platform and kustatan production facility 
all of these assets are located along the west side of the cook inlet 
we also acquired  acres of oil and gas leases  including  acres under the susitna basin exploration license as well as completed d seismic geology and other production facilities 
at 
table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share and per unit data closing we paid pacific energy  and provided  for bonds  contract cure payments and other federal and state of alaska requirements to operate the facilities 
in april  we changed our name to miller energy resources  inc on june   we acquired a minority interest in each of two limited liability companies  pellissippi pointe  llc and pellissippi pointe ii  llc for total cash consideration of we have also agreed to indemnify the sellers of the membership interests with respect to their guaranties of the construction loans held by the pellissippi pointe entities 
on july   we signed a direct guarantee for of the loan obligation outstanding of  with fsg bank 
as of april   the loan obligation is  and the liability recorded for the guarantee is the pellissippi pointe entities own two office buildings in west knoxville  tennessee 
in november   we moved our corporate headquarters into one of these buildings  located at cogdill road  knoxville  tennessee 
we executed a five year lease for the space  and with the addition of us  the building is fully occupied by tenants 
item a 
risk factors 
in addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in the form k  you should carefully consider the following known  material risk factors associated with our business  the oil and gas industry in which we operate  and the ownership of our securities 
if any of the events described below occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or access to the capital markets could be materially adversely affected  and holders or purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments 
there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known 
we may include additional risk factors in the prospectuses for securities we issue in the future 
risks related to our business we have a history of operating losses and incurred a net loss in fiscal  and fiscal our revenues are not currently sufficient to fund our operating expenses and there are no assurances we will develop profitable operations 
we reported operating losses of  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal as a result of the continued expansion of our business during fiscal  our operating expenses presently exceed our revenues 
we anticipate that our operating expenses will continue to increase as we continue to develop our operations in both tennessee and alaska 
we will continue depleting our cash resources to fund operating expenses until such time as we are able to significantly increase our revenues 
we have had to borrow money and raise money through issuances of equity in order to fund our operations in the past  resulting in debt costs  interest  and dilution of our existing shareholders equity 
we may have to reduce our expansion efforts if we have not seen an increase in revenues in the next fiscal year  which could also lead to a loss of properties or reserves 
there are no assurances that we will be able to significantly increase our revenues or develop profitable operations 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years   and  we and our independent public accounting firms identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
if we fail to achieve or maintain effective internal control over financial reporting  we may be unable to accurately and timely report our financial results or prevent fraud  and our business  investor confidence and the market price of our shares may be adversely impacted 
in the course of the preparation and audit of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years   and we and our independent registered public accounting firms identified a number of deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting  including material weaknesses as defined in the standards established by the us public company accounting oversight board standard 
a material weakness is a deficiency  or a combination of deficiencies  in internal control over financial reporting  such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis  and a significant deficiency is a deficiency  or a combination of deficiencies  in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness  but important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the company financial reporting 
the material weaknesses identified for the fiscal years  and related to a lack of human resources in our accounting and finance departments 
in the audit of our consolidated financial statements for fiscal  we and our independent registered public accounting firm determined that enough time had not lapsed since the hiring of additional accounting personnel to provide assurance that the material weakness has been remediated 
in remediating the material weakness  we may experience difficulties in integrating new personnel into the accounting department and may identify areas where additional personnel may be required 
in an effort to meet the demands of our planned activities in fiscal and thereafter  we may be required to supplement our staff with more expensive contract and consultant personnel until we are able to hire new employees  if necessary 
we further may not be successful in our efforts to enhance our systems  accounting  controls and reporting performance 
all of this may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows and growth plans  on our regulatory and listing status  and on our stock price 

table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share and per unit data we are subject to debt costs under the terms of our credit facility with apollo investment corporation 
monies borrowed are subject to an interest rate of per annum 
as described later in this annual report  in june we entered into a loan agreement with apollo investment corporation  under which a credit facility of up to  the apollo credit facility was made available to us 
at closing  we drew  under the apollo credit facility  and have drawn  in subsequent borrowings and in paid in kind interest  for a total indebtedness under our apollo credit facility of approximately  that amount and any other monies borrowed by us bear interest at mezzanine rates and are subject to a make whole premium and prepayment penalties if any prepayments are made prior to june  these debt costs may be substantial  and will adversely impact our results until the facility has been repaid 
restrictive debt covenants could limit our growth and our ability to finance our operations  fund our capital needs  respond to changing conditions  and engage in other business activities that may be in our best interests 
the apollo credit facility contains a number of significant covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to pay for general and administrative expenses  deviate from the approved plan of development apod  dispose of assets  incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain types of preferred stock  pay dividends on our capital stock  create liens on our assets  enter into sale or leaseback transactions  enter into specified investments or acquisitions  repurchase  redeem or retire our capital stock or subordinated debt  merge or consolidate  or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries  engage in specified transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates  or pursue other corporate activities 
because we are limited in the total amount we may spend on general and administrative expenses  we may need to make reductions in general and administrative expenses in future periods  which could impact our ability to operate our business and achieve our aggressive plan for development 
the apollo credit facility further establishes priorities among the projects we may choose to fund using either loan proceeds or our ordinary collections in the apod 
this may constrain management ability to pursue projects in their optimal order  or require us to obtain waivers or consents from our lenders in order to deviate from the apod 
we may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants under the apollo credit facility 
if we fail to meet financial and production covenants contained in the apollo credit facility  we may be limited in our ability to make additional borrowings under the apollo credit facility  obtain additional funds on favorable terms  make capital expenditures  withstand a downturn in our business or the economy  or pay dividends on our series b and series c preferred stock 
if the failure to meet these covenants results in a default  we could face the acceleration of our indebtedness under the apollo credit facility which would become immediately due and payable 
the apollo credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition and oil and gas production level tests 
our ability to comply with these ratios and financial condition and production level tests may be affected by events beyond our control and  as a result  we may be unable to meet these ratios and financial condition and production level tests 
these financial ratio restrictions and financial condition and production level tests could limit our ability to obtain future financings  make needed capital expenditures  withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities 
a decline in oil and natural gas prices  a prolonged period of oil and natural gas prices at lower levels  or any event which limits our ability to meet oil and gas production requirements specified in the apollo credit facility could eventually result in our failing to meet one or more of the financial and production level covenants required by the apollo credit facility  which could require us to raise additional capital at an inopportune time or on terms not favorable to us 
a breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios or financial condition or production level tests could result in a default under the apollo credit facility 
a default under that facility  if not cured or waived  could result in acceleration of all indebtedness outstanding under our credit agreement 
the accelerated debt would become 
table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share and per unit data immediately due and payable 
if that should occur  we may be unable to pay all such debt or to borrow sufficient funds to refinance it 
even if new financing were then available  it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us 
during fiscal  we sought amendments to the apollo credit facility to revise the dates on which the covenant tests would commence  and paid waiver fees up to if  in the future  we are required to obtain similar amendments as a result of our inability to meet the required financial ratios  there can be no assurance that those amendments will be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
based on our production levels existing at april   we would not achieve compliance with the production covenant under the apollo credit facility as of october   the next relevant testing date 
our ability to meet this covenant by that date will depend on new sources of production coming online subsequent to april   including production from ru a  which was brought online in june no assurance can be made regarding ru a continued output in the future or the success of our efforts to increase production from other wells 
material differences between the estimated and actual timing of critical events may affect the completion and commencement of production from our projects 
we have identified and budgeted for numerous drilling locations  but we may not be able to drill those locations within our expected time frame or at all 
our projects may be delayed by the availability of third party rigs  project approvals from joint venture partners  timely issuances of permits and licenses by governmental agencies  weather conditions  manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment  equipment repairs  the availability of sufficient capital resources  and other unforeseen events 
delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events may adversely affect our production and our projected cash flows from operations 
we are party to several lawsuits seeking millions of dollars in damages against us 
an adverse decision in any of these lawsuits could result in our being forced to pay the prevailing plaintiff substantial amounts of money that would adversely impact our ability to continue with our development plans and or operate our business 
as described later in this annual report  we are subject to lawsuits seeking millions of dollars in damages against us 
while we believe these suits to be of an essentially frivolous nature  litigation is inherently unpredictable  and any damages that could ultimately be paid by us in relation to any of these lawsuits are subject to significant uncertainty 
the timing and progression of each case is also unpredictable  it may take years for the case to make its way to trial and through various appeals 
the total amounts that will ultimately be paid by us in relation to all obligations relating to these lawsuits are subject to significant uncertainty and the ultimate exposure and cost to us will be dependent on many factors  including the time spent litigating each case and the attorneys fees incurred by us in defending the cases  and whether our insurance provides coverage for the claims asserted in each case 
our consolidated financial statements contained herein do not contain any reserves for any potential damages associated with this pending litigation 
if we should not be successful in our defense of this pending litigation  our results of operations in future periods could be materially adversely impacted 
cie operations are subject to oversight by the alaska dnr 
cie oil and gas leases could be terminated if it fails to uphold the terms of the assignment oversight agreement 
if the leases were terminated  we would be unable to continue our operations as they are presently conducted 
the assignment oversight agreement  along with the performance bond agreement for the redoubt unit and redoubt shoal field  also impose significant bonding requirements on us  which could adversely impact our ability to increase our revenues in future periods 
as a condition of the assignment of certain leases  cie entered into the assignment oversight agreement with the alaska dnr effective november  the terms of the agreement require cie to meet certain funding thresholds and report to the alaska dnr regularly  until the alaska dnr determines that cie has completed its development and operation obligations under the leases 
should cie fail to submit the information required under the agreement  or spend funds for items or activities that do not support core oil and gas activity as set out in the plan of operations or plan of development for the leases  the alaska dnr could choose to terminate the leases 
additionally  on march   cie entered into a performance bond agreement with the dnr concerning certain bonding requirements initially established by the assignment oversight agreement 
the performance bond  which is set at  is intended to ensure that cie has sufficient funds to meet its dismantlement  removal and restoration obligations pertaining to the redoubt unit and redoubt shoal field 
the agreement includes a funding schedule  which requires payments annually on july  beginning in  of amounts ranging from  to  per year  and totaling  as approximately  was funded by the previous owner 
if cie is more than days late with a payment to the state trust account or more than days late providing proof of a payment into a private account  the state will assess a late payment fee of our obligation to fund the bond beginning in july will adversely impact our cash resources available to devote to the expansion of our operations 
if we must pay one or more late payment fees  it will further reduce the cash resources we have available to devote to the expansion of our operations and could adversely impact our ability to increase our revenues in future periods 

table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share and per unit data we may be subject to regulatory actions surrounding the filing of the form k on july   the audit committee of our board of directors determined that our consolidated balance sheet at april   and our consolidated statements of operations  stockholders equity and cash flows for the year then ended collectively  the financial statements  as well as the report of kpmg llp dated july  on such statements  all as included in our form k  should not be relied upon 
the form k was filed with the sec on july  prior to kpmg llp completing its audit of the consolidated financial statements and issuing their independent accountants report thereon  or issuing its consent to the use of their report 
we received a request from the sec for a more detailed explanation regarding the specific circumstances that led to the filing of the form k that included the audit report and consent from kpmg llp prior to the completion of their audit 
in september  we provided the requested explanation to the sec and are fully cooperating with the staff 
we cannot predict the nature of any additional responses or actions that may be required of us surrounding the filing of the form k 
such responses could divert management time and attention from the operation of our business and could result in increased legal fees and fines 
we may fail to fully identify potential problems related to acquired businesses or assets  or obtain protection from the sellers  and the integration of significant acquisitions may be difficult 
our business plan contemplates significant acquisitions of reserves  properties  prospects  and leaseholds and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategy  which may include the acquisition of asset packages of producing properties or existing companies or businesses operating in our industry 
the successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors  including recoverable reserves  future oil and natural gas prices and their appropriate differentials  development and operating costs  and potential environmental and other liabilities 
the accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain 
in connection with these assessments  we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices 
our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves 
inspections may not always be performed on every well  and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken 
even when problems are identified  the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems 
we are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and acquired properties on an as is basis 
significant acquisitions of existing companies or businesses and other strategic transactions may involve additional risks  including diversion of our management attention to evaluating  negotiating  and integrating significant acquisitions and strategic transactions  our ability to meet the reporting requirements under federal securities laws due to the condition or availability of the target financial records  the challenge and cost of integrating acquired operations  accounting  internal controls  human resources  information management  administrative  and other technology systems  and business cultures with our own while carrying on our ongoing business  the adjustment to operating a larger combined organization once integrations are complete  failure to realize expected synergies and cost savings  difficulty associated with coordinating geographically separate organizations  and the challenge of attracting and retaining personnel associated with acquired operations 
the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of our business 
members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process  which will decrease the time they will have to manage our business 
if our senior management is not able to manage the integration process effectively  or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process  our business could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share and per unit data certain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on the acreage 
a sizeable portion of our acreage is currently undeveloped 
unless production is established on these leases during their terms  the leases will expire 
if our leases expire  we will lose our right to develop the related properties 
our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors  including drilling results  oil and natural gas prices  the availability and cost of capital  drilling and production costs  availability of drilling services and equipment  gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints  and regulatory approvals 
our susitna basin exploration licenses require us to fulfill certain work commitments and convert acreage to leases in order to retain the acreage after the term of the license 
over  acres of our total acreage consists of the three susitna basin exploration licenses in cook inlet  alaska 
these three licenses require us to spend a total of  in work commitments before we may convert the licenses into leases 
we may not be able to complete our work commitments in a timely manner  or if we do complete them  we may not identify any acreage that we would convert to leases 
this could result in a substantial decrease in our total acreage in the cook inlet basin 
the development of our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate 
approximately of our total estimated proved reserves at april  were proved undeveloped reserves 
in addition  there are no assurances that probable and possible reserves will be converted to proved reserves 
recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
the reserve data included in our reserve engineer reports assumes that substantial capital expenditures are required to develop such reserves  and we typically hold most or all of the working interests in our wells  so must bear most or all of the costs of development ourselves 
although cost and reserve estimates attributable to our natural gas and crude oil reserves have been prepared in accordance with industry standards  we cannot be sure that the estimated costs are accurate  that development will occur as scheduled or that the results of such development will be as estimated 
we also have a significant amount of unproved reserves at april  there is significant uncertainty attached to unproved reserve estimates  which include probable and possible reserves 
proved reserves are more likely to be produced than probable reserves and probable reserves are more likely to be produced than possible reserves 
there are no assurances that we can develop probable or possible reserves into proved reserves  or that if developed  these reserves will become producing reserves to the level of the estimates 
the results of our use of horizontal drilling in tennessee using long laterals and modern completion techniques are subject to more uncertainties than our vertical drilling programs and may not meet our expectations for reserves or production 
during fiscal  we believe we became the first company to drill horizontal oil wells in the fort payne formation in tennessee 
part of our drilling strategy in formations where we have drilled horizontal wells involves the drilling of long horizontal laterals and the use of modern completion techniques of multi stage fracture stimulations that have been used in other basins by other operators 
our experience with horizontal drilling and multi stage fracture stimulations of these formations to date is relatively limited and there is no way at this time to determine whether the use of these techniques will prove to be commercially successful in the formations of interest in tennessee 
our commodity price risk management and trading activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from price increases and may expose us to the risk of financial loss 
to the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves from commodity price declines  we may be prevented from realizing the full benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk 
in addition  our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which our production falls short of the hedged volumes  there is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement  the counterparties to our hedging or other price risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements  or a sudden unexpected event materially impacts oil and natural gas prices 
our business depends on oil and natural gas transportation facilities  most of which are owned by others 
the marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in large part on the availability  proximity and capacity of pipeline systems owned by third parties 
the lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could result in the shut in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of drilling plans for properties 
the lack of availability of these facilities for an extended period of time could negatively affect our revenues 
federal and state regulation of oil and natural gas production and 
table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share and per unit data transportation  tax and energy policies  changes in supply and demand  pipeline pressures  damage to or destruction of pipelines  and general economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to produce  gather and transport oil and natural gas 
the majority of our oil production is dedicated to one customer and as a result  our credit exposure to this customer is significant 
we have entered into an oil marketing agreement with tesoro refining and marketing company under which tesoro purchases all of our oil production in alaska 
we generally do not require letters of credit or collateral to support these trade receivables 
accordingly  a material adverse change in their financial condition could adversely impact our ability to collect the applicable receivables  and thereby affect our financial condition 
the majority of our reserves and assets  including our cook inlet basin leases and our osprey platform  are located in a region of active volcanoes and we could be subject to the adverse impacts of natural disasters or other regional events 
the cook inlet region contains active volcanoes  including augustine volcano  mount spurr and mount redoubt  and volcanic eruptions in this region have been associated with earthquakes and tsunamis 
debris avalanches have also resulted in tsunamis 
in  the cipl suspended operations on several occasions as a result of the spring major eruption of mount redoubt which also resulted in a shutdown of the drift river oil terminal 
our operations in this area are subject to all of the inherent risks associated with operations in a geographical region which is subject to natural disasters and we are susceptible to the risk of damage to our operations and assets located in the cook inlet basin 
while our facilities are engineered to withstand seismic activity  and the current tight line configuration should allow us to continue shipments through an active volcanic period without much interruption  we do not maintain business interruption insurance which could adversely impact our results of operations as the result of lost revenues in future periods 
the majority of our oil and gas reserves are located in the cook inlet basin 
any regional events  including price fluctuations  the natural disasters mentioned above  restrictive laws or regulations that increase costs  reduce availability of equipment or supplies  reduce demand or limit our production may impact our operations more than if our reserves were more geographically diversified 
disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of the series c preferred stock 
over the last several years  the united states stock and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility  dislocations and liquidity disruptions  which have caused market prices of many stocks and debt securities to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably 
more recently  the financial crisis in europe which relates primarily to concerns that certain european countries may be unable to pay their national debt has had a similar  although less pronounced  effect 
these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets  making terms for certain financings less attractive and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing 
unrest in certain middle eastern countries and the resultant increase in petroleum prices have added to the uncertainty in the capital markets 
such uncertainty will lead to continued volatility in the stock and credit markets and may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing at reasonable terms 
a prolonged downturn in the stock or credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing 
these types of events in the stock and credit markets may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock  preferred stock or debt securities 
these disruptions may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock and preferred stock  including the series c preferred stock  the return we receive on our investments  as well as other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy in general 
risks related to the oil and natural gas industry estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are inherently imprecise 
any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will affect materially the quantities and present value of our reserves 
estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves and the future net cash flows attributable to those reserves are prepared by independent petroleum engineers and geologists 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and cash flows attributable to such reserves  including factors beyond our control and that of our engineers 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same available data 
the accuracy of an estimate of quantities of reserves  or of cash flows attributable to such reserves  is a function of the available data  assumptions regarding future oil and natural gas prices and expenditures for future development drilling and exploration activities  and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
additionally  reserves and future cash flows may be subject to material downward or upward revisions  based upon production history  development drilling and exploration activities and prices of oil and natural gas 
actual future production  revenue  taxes  development drilling expenditures  operating expenses  underlying information  quantities of recoverable reserves and the value of cash flows from such reserves may vary significantly from the assumptions and underlying information set forth herein 

table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share and per unit data we may not realize an adequate return on wells that we drill 
drilling for oil and gas involves numerous risks  including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs 
the wells we drill or participate in may not be productive  and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in those wells 
the seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that crude oil or natural gas is present or may be produced economically 
the costs of drilling  completing  and operating wells are often uncertain  and drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed  or canceled as a result of a variety of factors including  without limitation unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  fires  explosions  blowouts  and surface cratering  marine risks such as capsizing  collisions  or adverse weather conditions  and increase in the cost of  or shortages or delays in the availability of  drilling rigs and equipment 
future drilling activities may not be successful  and  if unsuccessful  this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition 
while all drilling  whether developmental or exploratory  involves these risks  exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons 
oil and gas prices fluctuate due to a number of uncontrollable factors  creating a component of uncertainty in our development plans and overall operations 
declines in prices adversely affect our financial results and rate of growth in proved reserves and production 
oil and gas markets are very volatile  and we cannot predict future oil and natural gas prices 
the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production heavily influence our revenue  profitability  access to capital and future rate of growth 
the prices we receive for our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in global supply and demand for oil and gas  the actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries  the level of global oil and gas exploration and production activity  weather conditions  technological advances affecting energy consumption  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and tax policies  proximity and capacity of oil and gas pipelines and other transportation facilities 
additionally  a decline in future oil and natural gas prices and the related reduction in revenues could precipitate a breach in the interest coverage ratio covenant contained in our loan agreement with apollo 
discoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production 
the production rate from oil and gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted  while related per unit production costs generally increase as a result of decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors 
therefore  unless we add reserves through exploration and development activities or  through engineering studies  identify additional behind pipe zones  secondary recovery reserves  or tertiary recovery reserves  or acquire additional properties containing proved reserves  our estimated proved reserves will decline materially as reserves are produced 
future oil and gas production is  therefore  highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves on an economic basis 
furthermore  if oil or gas prices increase  our cost for additional reserves could also increase 
the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves will not necessarily be the same as the current market value of our estimated natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids reserves 
you should not assume that the present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves referred to in this annual report is the current market value of our estimated natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves are based on prices and costs on the date of the estimate  held constant for the life of the properties 
actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate 
actual future net cash flows will also be affected by increases or decreases in consumption by oil and gas purchasers and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
the timing of both the production and the incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and gas properties affects the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves 
in addition  the discount factor  which is required by the sec to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  is not necessarily an appropriate discount factor for determining a market valuation 
the effective interest rate at various times and the risks associated with our business or the oil and gas industry in general will affect the relevance of the discount factor 

table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share and per unit data our business involves a high degree of operational risk  particularly risk of personal injury  damage  or loss of equipment  and environmental accidents that may result in substantial losses for which insurance may be unavailable or inadequate 
our operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in drilling for oil and gas  such as fires  natural disasters  explosions  formations with abnormal pressures  casing collapses  uncontrollable flows of underground gas  blowouts  surface cratering  pipeline ruptures or cement failures  and environmental hazards such as natural gas leaks  oil spills and discharges of toxic gases 
any of these risks can cause substantial losses resulting from injury or loss of life  damage to or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution and other environmental damages  regulatory investigations and penalties  suspension of our operations and repair and remediation costs 
in addition  our liability for environmental hazards may include conditions created by the previous owners of properties that we purchase or lease 
we maintain insurance coverage against some  but not all  potential losses 
we do not believe that insurance coverage for all environmental damages that could occur is available at a reasonable cost 
losses could occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks  or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage 
the occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
we face strong industry competition that may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations 
strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas exploration and production industry 
we compete with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for acquisition of oil and gas leases  properties  and reserves  equipment  and labor required to explore  develop  and operate those properties  and marketing of oil and natural gas production 
crude oil and natural gas prices impact the costs of properties available for acquisition and the number of companies with the financial resources to pursue acquisition opportunities 
many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially larger than we possess and have established strategic long term positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new entry 
as a consequence  we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights 
in addition  many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production  such as fluctuating worldwide commodity prices and levels of production  the cost and availability of alternative fuels  and the application of government regulations 
we also compete in attracting and retaining personnel  including geologists  geophysicists  engineers  and other specialists 
these competitive pressures may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations 
our industry is subject to extensive environmental regulation that may limit our operations and negatively impact our production 
as a result of increased enforcement of existing regulations and potential new regulations following the gulf of mexico oil spill  the costs for complying with government regulation could increase 
extensive federal  state  and local environmental laws and regulations in the united states affect all of our operations 
environmental laws to which we are subject in the us include  but are not limited to  the clean air act and comparable state laws that impose obligations related to air emissions  the rcra  and comparable state laws that impose requirements for the handling  storage  treatment or disposal of solid and hazardous waste from our facilities  the cercla and comparable state laws that regulate the cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us or at locations to which our hazardous substances have been transported for disposal  and the clean water act  and comparable state laws that regulate discharges of wastewater from our facilities to state and federal waters 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations or newly adopted laws or regulations may trigger a variety of administrative  civil and criminal enforcement measures  including the assessment of monetary penalties  the imposition of remedial requirements  and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations or imposing additional compliance requirements on such operations 
certain environmental laws  including cercla and analogous state laws  impose strict  joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances or hydrocarbons have been disposed or otherwise released 
moreover  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances  hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment 
environmental legislation may require that we do the following acquire permits before commencing drilling  restrict spills  releases or emissions of various substances produced in association with our operations  limit or prohibit drilling activities on protected areas such as wetlands or wilderness areas  take reclamation measures to prevent pollution from former operations  take remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former operations  such as plugging abandoned wells and remedying contaminated soil and groundwater  and take remedial measures with respect to property designated as a contaminated site 
there is inherent risk of incurring environmental costs and liabilities in connection with our operations due to our handling of natural gas and other petroleum products  air emissions and water discharges related to our operations  and historical industry 
table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share and per unit data operations and waste disposal practices 
the costs of any of these liabilities are presently unknown but could be significant 
we may not be able to recover all or any of these costs from insurance 
in addition  we are unable to predict what impact the gulf oil spill will have on independent oil and gas companies such as our company 
for instance  companies such as ours currently pay an per barrel tax on all oil produced in the us which is contributed to the oil spill liability trust fund 
there are pending proposals to raise this tax to to per barrel 
it is also probable that there will be increased enforcement of existing regulations and adoption of new regulations which will also increase our cost of doing business which would reduce our operating profits in future periods 
should we fail to comply with all applicable ferc administered statutes  rules  regulations and orders  we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines 
under the energy policy act of  ferc has authority to impose penalties for violations of the natural gas act  up to per day for each violation and disgorgement of profits associated with any violation 
ferc has recently proposed and adopted regulations that may subject our facilities to reporting and posting requirements 
additional rules and legislation pertaining to these and other matters may be considered or adopted by ferc from time to time 
failure to comply with ferc regulations could subject us to civil penalties 
derivatives regulation included in current or proposed financial legislation and rulemaking could impede our ability to manage business and financial risks by restricting our use of derivative instruments as hedges against fluctuating commodity prices 
the dodd frank act  which was signed into law in july  contains significant derivatives regulation  including a requirement that certain transactions be cleared on exchanges and a requirement to post collateral commonly referred to as margin for such transactions 
the act provides for a potential exception from these clearing and collateral requirements for commercial end users and it includes a number of defined terms that will be used in determining how this exception applies to particular derivative transactions and the parties to those transactions 
we expect to qualify as a commercial end user 
as required by the dodd frank act  the commodities futures and trading commission cftc has promulgated numerous rules to define these terms 
in addition  it is possible that the cftc  in conjunction with prudential regulators  may mandate that financial counterparties entering into swap transactions with end users must do so with credit support agreements in place  which could result in negotiated credit thresholds above which an end user must post collateral 
we use derivative instruments with respect to a portion of our expected crude oil and natural gas production in order to reduce the impact of commodity price fluctuations and enhance the stability of cash flows to support our capital investment programs and acquisitions 
our current derivative contracts do not require the posting of margin up to depending on the rules and definitions adopted by the cftc and prudential regulators  we could be required to post significant amounts of collateral with our dealer counterparties for derivative transactions 
requirements to post cash collateral could result in negative impacts on our liquidity and financial flexibility and also cause us to incur additional debt and or reduce capital investment 
in addition  the final cftc rules may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to move some of their derivative activities to a separate entity  which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty 
proposed federal  state  or local regulation regarding hydraulic fracturing could increase our operating and capital costs 
several proposals are before the us congress that  if implemented  would either prohibit or restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing or subject the process to regulation under the safe drinking water act 
several states are considering legislation to regulate hydraulic fracturing practices that could impose more stringent permitting  transparency  and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether 
in addition  some municipalities have significantly limited or prohibited drilling activities and or hydraulic fracturing  or are considering doing so 
we routinely use fracturing techniques in the us and other regions to expand the available space for natural gas and oil to migrate toward the wellbore 
it is typically done at substantial depths in very tight formations 
although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the legislation regarding hydraulic fracturing  any new federal  state  or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions in the us the effects of future environmental legislation on our business are unknown but could be substantial 
environmental legislation is evolving in a manner expected to result in stricter standards and enforcement  larger fines and liability and potentially increased capital expenditures and operating costs 
changes in  or enforcement of  environmental laws may result in a curtailment of our production activities  or a material increase in the costs of production  development drilling or exploration  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or prospects 
in addition  many countries  as well as several states in the united states have agreed to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases 

table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share and per unit data methane  a primary component of natural gas  and carbon dioxide  a byproduct of burning natural gas  are greenhouse gases 
regulation of greenhouse gases could adversely impact some of our operations and demand for products in the future 
the proposed us federal budget for fiscal year includes certain provisions that  if passed as originally submitted  will have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
on april   the office of management and budget released a summary of the proposed us federal budget for fiscal year the proposed budget repeals many tax incentives and deductions that are currently used by us oil and gas companies and imposes new taxes 
the provisions eliminate of the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred  repeal percentage depletion for oil and natural gas wells  repeal the domestic manufacturing deduction for oil and natural gas companies  increase the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers to seven years  repeal the exception to passive loss limitations for working interests in oil and natural gas properties  repeal the enhanced oil recovery credit  and repeal the credit for oil and gas produced from marginal wells 
should some or all of these provisions become law  our taxes will increase  potentially significantly  which would have a negative impact on our net income and cash flows 
this could also cause us to reduce our drilling activities 
as none of these proposals have yet been voted on or become law  we do not know the ultimate impact these proposed changes may have on our business 
risks related to the ownership of our securities we do not currently pay dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the future 
we intend to retain any future earnings to fund our operations  therefore  we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
also  our credit agreement does not permit us to pay dividends on our common stock 
we are prohibited by tennessee law from paying dividends  if after the payment of the dividend we are unable to pay our debts as they come due in the ordinary course of business  or if our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed  if we were to be dissolved at the time of the dividend  to satisfy any preferential liquidation rights to those of our common stock 
certain of our outstanding warrants contain cashless exercise provisions  which means we will not receive any cash proceeds upon their exercise 
at april   we have common stock warrants outstanding to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock with an average exercise price of per share which are exercisable on a cashless basis 
this means that the holders  rather than paying the exercise price in cash  may surrender a number of warrants equal to the exercise price of the warrants being exercised 
it is possible that the warrant holders will utilize the cashless exercise feature which will deprive us of additional capital which might otherwise be obtained if the warrants did not contain a cashless feature 
a large portion of our outstanding common shares are restricted securities and we have outstanding options  warrants and purchase rights to purchase approximately of our currently outstanding common stock 
the exercise of these options  warrants and purchase rights would be dilutive to our current shareholders  and could adversely affect our stock price 
we may  in the future  issue our previously authorized and unissued securities  resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present shareholders 
we are currently authorized to issue  shares of common stock and  shares of preferred stock with such designations  preferences and rights as determined by our board of directors 
at july  we had  shares of common stock outstanding together with outstanding options and warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at exercise prices of between and per share 
of our outstanding shares of common stock at july   approximately  shares are restricted securities 
future sales of restricted common stock under rule or otherwise could negatively impact the market price of our common stock 
in addition  in the event of the exercise of the warrants and options  the number of our outstanding common stock will increase by approximately  which will have a dilutive effect on our existing shareholders 
the impacts of non cash gains and losses from derivative accounting in future periods could materially impact our financial results 
to manage variability in cash flows resulting from fluctuation in oil prices  we occasionally enter into commodity derivatives to hedge a portion of our crude oil production 
these instruments are marked to market on a periodic basis with changes in the estimated fair value recorded to our consolidated statement of operations 
as of april   we have a derivative liability of we recognized a non cash loss on derivatives of  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal the amount of quarterly non cash gains or losses we will record in future periods is unknown at this time as the measurement is based upon the fair market value of oil on the measurement date 
it is likely  however  that these non cash gains or losses will continue to have a material impact on our financial results in future periods

accordingly  they have significant influence in the election of our directors and  therefore  our policies and direction 
this concentration of voting power could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock or prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their shares of common stock 
the change of control conversion feature of our series c preferred stock may prevent a change in control  or discourage a third party from acquiring us the change of control conversion feature of the series c preferred stock may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us or of delaying  deferring or preventing certain of our change of control transactions under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common stock and series c preferred stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price of such stock  or that shareholders may otherwise believe is in their best interests

our loan agreement with apollo prohibits payments of dividends on the series c preferred stock if we fail to comply with certain financial covenants or  at certain times  if a default or event of default has occurred 
certain of our other existing or future debt instruments may restrict the authorization  payment or setting apart of dividends on the series c preferred stock 
future offerings of debt or senior equity securities may adversely affect the market price of the series c preferred stock 
if we decide to issue debt or senior equity securities in the future  it is possible that these securities will be governed by an indenture or other instruments containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility 
additionally  any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights  preferences and privileges more favorable than those of the series c preferred stock and may result in dilution to owners of the series c preferred stock 
we and  indirectly  our shareholders  will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities 
because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control  we cannot predict or estimate the amount  timing or nature of our future offerings 
the holders of the series c preferred stock will bear the risk of our future offerings  reducing the market price of the series c preferred stock and diluting the value of their holdings in us 
we may not be able to pay dividends on the series c preferred stock 
under tennessee law  cash dividends may be paid from net earnings only if we would still be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business after giving effect to the dividend payment  and our total assets are not less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed if we were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution  to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights on dissolution are superior to those receiving the distribution 
our ability to pay cash dividends on the series c preferred stock will require us to be profitable and to have positive net assets total assets less total liabilities over our capital 
further  notwithstanding these factors  we may not have sufficient cash to pay dividends on the series c preferred stock 
our ability to pay dividends may be impaired if any of the risks described in this annual report  were to occur 
in addition  payment of our dividends depends upon our financial condition and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time

upon the occurrence of a change of control  each holder of the series c preferred stock will have the right unless  prior to the change of control conversion date  we have provided notice of our election to redeem some or all of the shares of series c preferred stock held by such holder  in which case such holder will have the right only with respect to shares of series c preferred stock that are not called for redemption to convert some or all of such holder series c preferred stock into shares of our common stock or under specified circumstances involving certain alternative consideration 
although we generally may not redeem the series c preferred stock prior to november   we have a special optional redemption right to redeem the series c preferred stock in the event of a change of control  and holders of the series c preferred stock will not have the right to convert any shares that we have elected to redeem prior to the change of control conversion date 
if we do not elect to redeem the series c preferred stock prior to the change of control conversion date  then upon an exercise of the applicable conversion rights  the holders of series c preferred stock will be limited to a maximum number of shares of our common stock or other applicable consideration equal to multiplied by the number of shares of series c preferred stock converted 
the market price of the series c preferred stock could be substantially affected by various factors 
the market price of the series c preferred stock will depend on many factors  which may change from time to time  including prevailing interest rates  increases in which may have an adverse effect on the market price of the series c preferred stock  trading prices of common and preferred equity securities issued by other energy companies  the annual yield from distributions on the series c preferred stock as compared to yields on other financial instruments  general economic and financial market conditions  government action or regulation  the financial condition  performance and prospects of us and our competitors  changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts with respect to us  or competitors in our industry  our issuance of additional preferred equity or debt securities  and actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results of us and our competitors 
as a result of these and other factors  investors who purchase the series c preferred stock may experience a decrease  which could be substantial and rapid  in the market price of the series c preferred stock  including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 
we may issue additional shares of series c preferred stock and additional series of preferred stock that rank on parity with the series c preferred stock as to dividend rights  rights upon liquidation or voting rights 
we are allowed to issue additional shares of series c preferred stock and additional series of preferred stock that would rank equally to the series c preferred stock as to dividend payments and rights upon our liquidation  dissolution or winding up of our affairs pursuant to our amended and restated charter  as amended  and the articles of amendment for the series c preferred stock without any vote of the holders of the series c preferred stock 
the issuance of additional shares of series c preferred stock and preferred stock that would rank on parity with the series c preferred stock could have the effect of reducing the amounts 
table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share and per unit data available to the current holders of our series c preferred stock upon our liquidation or dissolution or the winding up of our affairs 
it also may reduce dividend payments to the current holders of the series c preferred stock if we do not have sufficient funds to pay dividends on all series c preferred stock outstanding and other classes of stock with equal priority with respect to dividends 
in addition  although holders of series c preferred stock are entitled to limited voting rights  with respect to such matters  the series c preferred stock will vote separately as a class along with the holders of all other classes or series of our equity securities we may issue upon which similar voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable and which are entitled to vote as a class with the series c preferred stock 
as a result  the voting rights of holders of series c preferred stock may be significantly diluted  and the holders of such other series of preferred stock that we may issue may be able to control or significantly influence the outcome of any vote 
future issuances and sales of preferred stock ranking on parity with the series c preferred stock  or the perception that such issuances and sales could occur  may cause prevailing market prices for the series c preferred stock and our common stock to decline and may adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital in the financial markets at times and prices favorable to us 
holders of series c preferred stock have extremely limited voting rights 
voting rights as a holder of series c preferred stock are limited 
our shares of common stock are the only class of our securities that carry full voting rights 
voting rights for holders of series c preferred stock exist primarily with respect to the ability to elect  voting together with the holders of any other classes or series of our equity securities we may issue upon which similar voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable and which are entitled to vote as a class with the series c preferred stock  two additional directors to our board of directors  subject to certain limitations  in the event that four quarterly dividends whether or not consecutive payable on the series c preferred stock are in arrears  and with respect to voting on amendments to our amended and restated charter  as amended  or articles of amendment relating to the series c preferred stock that materially and adversely affect the rights of the holders of series c preferred stock or authorize  increase or create additional classes or series of our shares that are senior to the series c preferred stock 
other than the limited circumstances described in this annual report  holders of series c preferred stock will not have any voting rights 
the series c preferred stock is a relatively new issue of securities and has only a limited trading market  which may negatively affect its value and the ability to transfer and sell shares 
the series c preferred stock is a relatively new issue of securities with only a limited trading market 
the volume of trades of shares of the series c preferred stock on the new york stock exchange nyse is often low  and an active trading market on the nyse for the series c preferred stock may not be maintained in the future and may not provide adequate liquidity 
the liquidity of any market for the series c preferred stock that may exist now or in the future will depend on a number of factors  including prevailing interest rates  the dividend rate on our common stock  our financial condition and operating results  the number of holders of the series c preferred stock  the market for similar securities and the interest of securities dealers in making a market in the series c preferred stock 
as a result  the ability to transfer or sell the series c preferred stock could be adversely affected 
if the series c preferred stock or our common stock is delisted  the ability to transfer or sell shares of the series c preferred stock may be limited  and the market value of the series c preferred stock will likely be materially adversely affected 
other than in connection with a change of control  the series c preferred stock does not contain provisions that are intended to protect stockholders if our common stock is delisted from the nyse 
since the series c preferred stock has no stated maturity date  stockholders may be forced to hold their shares of the series c preferred stock and receive stated dividends on the series c preferred stock when  and if authorized by our board of directors and paid by us with no assurance as to ever receiving the liquidation value thereof 
in addition  if our common stock is delisted from the nyse  it is likely that the series c preferred stock will be delisted from the nyse as well 
accordingly  if the series c preferred stock or our common stock is delisted from the nyse  the ability to transfer or sell shares of the series c preferred stock may be limited and the market value of the series c preferred stock will likely be materially adversely affected

executive overview we are an independent exploration and production company that utilizes seismic data and other technologies for geophysical exploration  development and operation of oil and gas wells in the appalachian region of east tennessee and in southcentral alaska 
occasionally  during times of excess capacity  we offer these services on a contract basis to third party customers primarily engaged in our core competency natural gas exploration and production 
strategy our mission is to grow a profitable exploration and production company for the long term benefit of our shareholders by focusing on the development of our reserves  continued expansion of our oil and natural gas properties and increasing our production and related cash flow 
we intend to accomplish these objectives through the execution of our core strategies  which include develop acquired acreage 
we will focus on organically growing production through drilling for our own benefit on existing leases and acreage in the exploration licenses with a view towards retaining the majority of working interest in the new wells 
this strategy will allow us to maintain operational control  which we believe will translate to long term benefits  increase production 
we plan on increasing oil and gas production through the maintenance  repair and optimization of wells located in the cook inlet region and development of wells in the appalachian region of east tennessee 
our operational team will employ a combination of the latest available technologies along with tried and true technologies to restore as well as explore and develop our properties  expand our revenue stream 
we intend to fully exploit our mid stream facilities  such as our injection wells and the kustatan production facility  our ability to engage in the commercial disposal of waste generated by oil and gas operations  our capacity to process third party fluids and natural gas and to offer excess electrical power to net users in the cook inlet region  and pursue strategic acquisitions 
we have significantly increased our oil and gas properties through strategic low cost high value acquisitions 
under the same strategy  our management team will continue to seek opportunities that meet our criteria for risk  reward  rate of return  and growth potential 
we plan to leverage our management team expertise to pursue value creating acquisitions when the opportunities arise  subject to the availability of sufficient capital 
our management team is focused on maintaining the financial flexibility required to successfully execute these core strategies 
our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and  therefore  our cash flow and income are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing current reserves and economically finding  developing and acquiring additional recoverable reserves 
we may not be able to find  develop or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we will focus on adding reserves through new drilling  well workovers and recompletions of our current wells 
additionally  we will seek to grow our production and our asset base by pursuing both organic growth opportunities and acquisitions of producing oil and natural gas reserves that are suitable for us 
financial and operating results we continued to utilize operational cash flow along with funds from our credit facility and funds raised from sales of our series c preferred stock made in two best efforts public offerings and in at the market public offerings to support our capital expenditures during fiscal for the fiscal year ended april   we reported notable achievements in several key areas 
highlights for the period include on june   we fully redeemed the outstanding series a preferred stock 
on june   we closed our new credit facility with apollo investment corporation and repaid our guggenheim credit facility

on august   we gained approval from state regulators to commence drilling with rig on the osprey offshore platform 
the rig has been used on workovers for ru  ru and ru and sidetracking a new ru a 
with subsequent work  ru and ru are now fulfilling of our current fuel gas demand with a combined flow rate around mmcfd 
on september   we entered into a special warrant exercise agreement with warrant holders  pursuant to which warrant holders agreed to exercise  warrants immediately for per share and waived their right to a cashless exercise 
we received net proceeds of  upon exercise of these warrants

this new series of stock is listed for trading on the nyse under the ticker symbol millprc 
we received net proceeds of  in connection with this sale 
on october   we entered into the atm agreement with mlv for the placement and sale of our common stock and series c preferred stock in one or more at the market public offerings from time to time 
the first sale made pursuant to this agreement occurred on november   as discussed below 
on october   we completed a workover on the ru well in the redoubt shoals field in alaska 
the workover involved replacing a failed electric submersible pump as well as removing other downhole obstructions 
we initially capitalized the cost of the workover as we believed the workover would significantly increase our access to proved reserves 
we ultimately concluded it should be expensed as the workover did not significantly increase our access to proved reserves 
the costs of the workover were written off during the fourth quarter 
starting on november   and periodically during the quarter  we issued  shares of our series c preferred stock in at the market offerings pursuant to the atm agreement and a prospectus supplement dated october  issued under our existing s registration statement  filed with the sec as file number 
these sales were made at an average price on the date of such sale ranging from to per share 
we received net proceeds of  in connection with these sales 
on november   we applied for a right of permits necessary for construction of the trans foreland pipeline 
when completed  this undersea pipeline will move our crude from the west side of the cook inlet where we have several producing units to the east side where the nearest refinery is located 
transporting the crude this way will be cheaper and safer than using tankers which is our only current option 
on january   we completed the first horizontal well in the mississippian lime in tennessee  cpp h the well was drilled into the fort payne formation to a true vertical depth of approximately  feet on our cumberland plateau partners llc lease in scott county  tennessee  and it exposed a pay section of approximately  feet in the horizontal section of the well 
on january   we brought a new gas well  ru a  into production on the osprey platform 
the workover consisted of re completing the well to access a behind pipe gas accumulation in the lower tyonek gas sands at a measured depth of approximately  feet

fiscal outlook as we head into fiscal  we believe our inventory of recompletion  workovers  and exploration and development projects offers numerous growth opportunities 
subsequent to april   we brought ru a online after using rig to complete a sidetrack 
we are currently using rig to work on a sidetrack at ru and expect to complete the sidetrack during the summer of upon completion of the sidetrack  we will work on recompletion of ru we also have several development projects onshore  which we expect will also contribute to production in fiscal  along with the offshore wells brought online subsequent to april  no assurance can be made regarding the success of these development and recompletion efforts 
our current capital budget is  the majority of this budget is expected to be spent on projects in alaska  with the remaining amount allocated to our appalachian region 
due to the uncertainty associated with changes in commodity prices  we closely monitor our cost levels and revise our capital budgets based on changes in forecasted cash flows 
this means our plan for capital expenditures may change as a result of anticipated changes in the market place 
further  our ability to fully utilize the budget will be dependent on a number of factors including  but not limited to  access to capital  weather and regulatory approval 
we note that  although we expect to continue to sell our series c preferred stock in additional at the market offerings during fiscal  we cannot guarantee that market conditions will continue to permit such sales at prices we would find acceptable 
if that occurred  cash generated from those offerings would cease 
we expect to fund a portion of our remaining capital budget with free cash flow from operations  state of alaska tax credits  potential joint ventures  and through debt  equity and preferred equity capital markets 
on may  and on july   we closed two other offerings of our series c preferred stock 
for additional information on these offerings  refer to note subsequent events  in the consolidated financial statements 
in the event we are unable to raise additional capital on acceptable terms  we may reduce our capital spending

significant deterioration in commodity prices negatively impacts revenues  earnings and cash flows  capital spending  and potentially our liquidity 
sales volumes and costs also impact cash flows  however  these historically have not been as volatile or as impactful as commodity prices in the short term 
our long term cash flows are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing current reserves and economically finding  developing and acquiring additional recoverable reserves 
cash investments are required continuously to fund exploration and development projects and acquisitions  which are necessary to offset the inherent declines in production and proven reserves 
we may not be able to find  develop or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs  which could materially adversely affect our future liquidity 
for a discussion of risk factors related to our business and operations  please refer to the section entitled risk factors in this annual report 
we may elect to utilize additional borrowing capacity under the apollo credit facility when available  proceeds from the sales of both debt and equity in the capital markets  or proceeds from the occasional sale of nonstrategic assets to supplement our liquidity and capital resource needs 
in fiscal  we experienced an operating loss 
we anticipate that our operating expenses will continue to increase as we fully develop our assets in the cook inlet and appalachian regions 
although we expect an increase in revenues from these development activities  we will continue depleting our cash resources to fund drilling and workover activities as well as other operating expenses until such time as we are able to significantly increase our revenues above costs 
we believe that the liquidity and capital resource alternatives available to us through the public offerings of additional series c preferred stock  in both at the market sales and additional underwritten offerings  combined with additions to the borrowing base under our apollo credit facility which may become available  and internally generated cash flows and other potential sources of funds  will be adequate to fund our short term and long term operations  including our capital budget  repayment of debt maturities  and any amount that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies  however  our apollo credit facility restricts our access to and control of certain bank accounts without compliance with certain provisions of the loan agreement 
the apollo credit facility also contains financial and production covenants 
as of april   we were not in compliance with such covenants 
however  we received a waiver of such violations from apollo on july  under the terms of the waiver  we will be required to maintain compliance with the financial and production covenants on a quarterly basis commencing october  based on our production levels existing at april   we would likely not achieve compliance with each of the covenants as of october  however  we believe we will sufficiently increase our production levels to enable us to achieve compliance with the financial and production covenants 
much of the increased production is expected to come from the success of ru a  which was brought online in june in addition to ru a  we are currently completing a sidetrack on ru that we expect to bring online during the summer of once ru is online  we expect to commence with the recompletion of ru we also have several ongoing development projects onshore  which we also expect will contribute to production in fiscal  along with the offshore wells brought online subsequent to april  no assurance can be made regarding the success of these development and recompletion efforts and our ability to meet future financial and production covenants 
in the event we do not comply with future financial and production covenants  we would evaluate alternative financing sources including  but not limited to  common or preferred equity offerings  joint ventures  and the financing of receivables 
these restrictions notwithstanding  absent an event of default  the apollo credit facility requires that apollo release to us funds needed to pay for approved operational activity  subject to certain limitations on the order in which we undertake new projects  and for the payment of certain permitted expenses that arise in the ordinary course of business 
the release of funds for other purposes is subject to apollo discretion  except that  absent an event of default and so long as at least half of these funds are spent on projects included in our plan of development  we do have the right to use of all proceeds raised from sales of equity securities in excess of  on such matters as we see fit 
we reached this  threshold on october   the date of the initial public offering of series c preferred stock 
the intent of the restrictions in the apollo credit facility on our ability to access cash in our accounts is to require that company allocate available cash to high priority projects first and to control spending that is not strongly linked to the development of our existing assets 
to date  the restrictions have not impeded our ability to run the business in any way  except that we have requested from time to time that apollo agree to change the priorities of certain projects on our approved plan of development  to better respond to changing market conditions in the cook inlet region 
periodic adjustments to our approved plan of development were contemplated by the terms of the apollo credit facility  and  to date  apollo has granted our requests when made 
we do not anticipate that the restrictions placed on our accounts under the apollo credit facility will interfere with or require any alteration of management overall plans in the future  subject to the need to make additional adjustments to the approved plan of development as market conditions change 
pursuant to the september  amendment september amendment to the apollo credit facility  upon each sale of our series c preferred stock  we have agreed to deposit a portion of the proceeds of the sale into a separate account in an amount

if an event of default were to occur under the apollo credit facility  apollo would have the right to take control over this account 
we have paid cash dividends on the series b preferred stock and the series c preferred stock in accordance with the terms of the series b preferred stock and the series c preferred stock as set forth in our charter 
current restricted cash balances include amounts held in escrow to secure company related credit cards 
as of april  and  current restricted cash also includes  and  of cash temporarily held in an account that is controlled by our lender 
non current restricted cash balances include amounts held in escrow to provide for the future plugging and abandonment of wells  including the possible dismantling of our off shore platform  and general liability bonds 
sources and uses of cash the following table presents the sources and uses of our cash and cash equivalents for the periods presented for the year ended april  sources of cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities proceeds from borrowings  net of debt acquisition costs proceeds from sale of equipment exercise of equity rights issuance of preferred stock  net of issuance costs uses of cash and cash equivalents net cash used in operating activities cash dividends capital expenditures for oil and gas properties purchase of equipment and improvements payments on debt redemption of preferred stock increase in restricted cash increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities our sources of capital and liquidity are partially supplemented by cash flows from operations  both in the short term and long term 
these cash flows  however  are highly impacted by volatility in oil and natural gas prices 
the factors in determining operating cash flows are largely the same as those that affect net earnings  with the exception of non cash expenses such as dd a  asset retirement obligation aro accretion  non cash compensation  and deferred income tax expense  which affect earnings but do not affect cash flows 
net cash used by operating activities of fiscal totaled  down  from the decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in revenue coupled with an increase in operating costs 
proceeds from credit facilities and other items as of april   borrowings under our apollo credit facility totaled  all of which was borrowed under the credit facility during fiscal in connection with the establishment of the facility  we paid  in debt issuance costs

we received net proceeds of  in connection with these post year end sales 
capital expenditures we use a combination of operating cash flows  borrowings under credit facilities and  from time to time  issuances of debt or common stock to fund significant capital projects 
due to the volatility in oil and natural gas prices  our capital expenditure budgets  both in the short term and long term  are adjusted on a frequent basis to reflect changes in forecasted operating cash flows  market trends in drilling and acquisition costs  and production projections 
total spending on capital projects increased slightly from the same period last year

table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share and per unit data non gaap measures adjusted earnings adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda is a significant performance metric used as a quantitative standard by our management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors  research analysts and others to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods  capital structure or historical cost basis  the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs and support our indebtedness  and our operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other companies in our industry  without regard to financing or capital structure

these estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the estimates are evaluated by management on an ongoing basis  and the results of these evaluations form a basis for making 
table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share and per unit data decisions about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
although actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  we believe that the estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements are reasonable 
the following is a discussion of our most critical accounting policies 
estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas and crude oil that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing conditions  operating conditions  and government regulations 
proved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage  or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 
undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled  or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility 
undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years  unless specific circumstances justify a longer time 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  our reserves are used throughout our financial statements 
for example  since we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties  the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our dd a expense 
further  these reserves are the basis for our unaudited supplemental oil and gas disclosures 
reserves as of april    and  were calculated using an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous months  held flat for the life of the production  except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements 
we elected not to disclose probable and possible reserves or reserve estimates in this filing 
asset retirement obligation we have significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations 
our removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms 
estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are regulatory  political  environmental  safety  and public relations considerations 
aro associated with retiring tangible long lived assets is recognized as a liability in the period in which the legal obligation is incurred and becomes determinable 
the liability is offset by a corresponding increase in the underlying asset 
the aro liability reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement  removal  site reclamation  and similar activities associated with our oil and gas properties 
we utilize current retirement costs to estimate the expected cash outflows for retirement obligations 
inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement  and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental  and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing aro liability  a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance 
accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value 
fair value of financial instruments we measure fair value of our financial and non financial assets and liabilities on a recurring basis 
accounting standards define fair value  establish a framework for measuring fair value and require certain disclosures about fair value measurements for assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis 
all of our derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our financial statements 
fair value is the exit price that we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value level quoted prices in active markets that are unadjusted and accessible at the measurement date for identical  unrestricted assets or liabilities  level quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are inactive  quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or financial instruments for which significant inputs are observable  either directly or indirectly  or level prices or valuations that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement 

table of contents dollars in thousands  except per share and per unit data we consider an active market to be one in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis  and view an inactive market as one in which there are few transactions for the asset or liability  prices are not current  or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers 
where appropriate  we consider non performance risk in determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities 
stock based compensation the computation of stock based compensation requires the use of a valuation model 
asc  compensation stock compensation  requires significant judgment and the use of estimates  particularly surrounding model assumptions such as stock price volatility  expected terms  and expected forfeiture rates  to value equity based compensation 
we use various pricing models to determine the fair value of our stock options and warrants 
changes in the underlying assumptions could result in a material change to the fair value of the stock based awards 
although every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of our estimates and assumptions  significant unanticipated changes in those estimates  interpretations and assumptions may result in recording expenses that could have a significant effect on results of operations in the future 
purchase price allocation accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business and recording deferred taxes for any differences between the allocated values and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
the purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording each asset and liability at its estimated fair value 
estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax basis of the acquired company s assets and liabilities and tax related carryforwards at the merger date  although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known 
in estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  we made various assumptions 
the most significant assumptions related to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved crude oil and natural gas properties 
to estimate the fair values of these properties  we prepared estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves as described above under estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows of this item estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on results of operations in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued asu  disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities  which increases disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities  with a scope clarification issued in january new disclosures are required to enable users of financial statements to understand significant quantitative differences in balance sheets prepared under gaap and ifrs related to the offsetting of financial instruments 
the existing gaap guidance allowing balance sheet offsetting  including industry specific guidance  remains unchanged 
the guidance in asu is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning on or after january  the disclosures should be applied retrospectively for all prior periods presented 
we have evaluated the new pronouncement and have determined that there is no impact to our consolidated financial statements 
there are no other recently issued accounting pronouncements that are expected to have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our exposure to market risk 
the term market risk relates to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil  gas  and interest rates  or adverse governmental actions 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
the forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
commodity risk our revenues  earnings  cash flow  capital investments  and  ultimately  future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our crude oil and natural gas  which have historically been very volatile due to unpredictable events such as economic growth or retraction  weather  and political climate 
we periodically enter into hedging activities on a portion of our projected oil production through financial arrangements intended to support oil prices at targeted levels and to manage our overall exposure to oil price fluctuations 
in and  approximately to of our crude oil production was subject to financial derivative hedges 
realized gains or losses from our price risk management activities are recognized in gain loss on derivatives  net when the associated production occurs 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
on april   we had open oil derivative hedges in a liability position with a fair value of a increase in oil prices would increase the fair value by approximately  while a decrease in prices would decrease the fair value by approximately these fair value changes assume volatility based on prevailing market parameters at april  for notional volumes and terms associated with our derivative contracts  please see note derivative instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv  item of this form k 
we conduct our risk management activities for commodities under the controls and governance of our risk management policy 
the audit committee of our board of directors approves and oversees these controls  which have been implemented by designated members of the management team 
the treasury and accounting departments also provide separate checks and reviews on the results of hedging activities 
controls for our commodity risk management activities include limits on volume  segregation of duties  delegation of authority and a number of other policy and procedural controls 
interest rate risk we consider our interest rate risk exposure to be minimal as a result of fixing interest rates on of our debt 
at april   there was no float rate debt that would expose us to market fluctuations in interest rates
