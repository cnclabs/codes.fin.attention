item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of our business 
management s discussion and analysis is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents trends in our business we are a leading provider of voice and language solutions for businesses and consumers around the world 
our solutions are used in the healthcare  mobile  consumer  enterprise customer service  and imaging markets 
we are seeing several trends in our markets  including i the growing adoption of cloud based  connected services and highly interactive mobile applications  ii deeper integration of virtual assistant capabilities and services  and iii the continued expansion of our core technology portfolio from speech recognition to natural language understanding  semantic processing  domain specific reasoning and dialog management capabilities 
healthcare 
trends in our healthcare business include continuing customer preference for hosted solutions and other time based licenses  and increasing interest in the use of mobile devices to access healthcare systems and records 
we continue to see strong demand for transactions which involve the sale and delivery of both software and non software related services or products  as well as transactions which involve the sale of multiple solutions  such as both hosted transcription services and dragon medical licenses 
although the volume processed in our hosted transcription services has steadily increased due to the expanding customer base  we have experienced some erosion in lines processed when customers adopt electronic medical record emr systems  and when in some cases customers use our licensed dragon medical product to support input into the emr 
we believe an important trend in the healthcare market is the impending change in the coding standard from icd to icd which is scheduled to take effect in october customers are adopting our solutions under the current coding standard  and we believe the migration to icd is creating an imperative to increase automation of this important workflow 
we are investing to expand our product set to address the various healthcare opportunities  including deeper integration with our clinical documentation solutions  as well as expand our international capabilities  and reduce our time from contract signing to initiation of billable services 
mobile and consumer 
trends in our mobile and consumer segment include device manufacturers requiring custom applications to deliver unique and differentiated products such as virtual assistants  broadening keyboard technologies to take advantage of touch screens  increasing hands free capabilities on cell phones and automobiles to address the growing concern of distracted driving  and the adoption of our technology on a broadening scope of devices  such as televisions  set top boxes  e book readers  tablet computers  cameras and third party applications 
the more powerful capabilities of mobile devices require us to supply a broader set of technologies to support the increasing scope and complexity of the solutions 
these technologies include cloud based speech recognition  natural language understanding  dialog management  text to speech and enhanced text input  where the complexity of the technologies allow us to charge a higher price 
within given levels of our technology set  we have seen pricing pressures from our oem partners in our mobile handset business 
we continue to see strong demand for transactions which involve the sale and delivery of both software and non software related services  as well as products to help customers define  design and implement increasingly robust and complex custom solutions such as virtual assistants 
we continue to see an increasing proportion of revenue from on demand and transactional arrangements as opposed to traditional upfront licensing of our mobile products and solutions 
although this has a negative impact on near term revenue  we believe this model will build stronger and more predictable revenues over time 
we are investing to increase our capabilities and capacity to help device manufacturers build custom applications  to increase the capacity of our data centers  to increase the number  kinds and capacity of network services  to enable developers to access our technology  and to expand both awareness and channels for our direct to consumer products 
enterprise 
trends in our enterprise business include increasing interest in the use of mobile applications and web sites to access customer care systems and records  voice based authentication of users  increasing interest in coordinating actions and data across customer care channels  and the ability of a broader set of hardware providers and systems integrators to serve the market 
we are investing to expand our product set to address these opportunities  to increase efficiency of our hosted applications  expand our capabilities and capacity to help customers build custom applications  and broaden our relationships with new hardware and systems integrator partners serving the market 
imaging 
the imaging market is evolving to include more networked solutions  mobile access to networked solutions  and multi function devices 
we expect to expand our traditional packaged software sales with subscription versions 
we are investing to improve mobile access to our networked products  expand our distribution channels and embedding relationships  and expand our language coverage 
confronted by dramatic increases in electronic information  consumers  business personnel and healthcare professionals must use a variety of resources to retrieve information  transcribe patient records  conduct transactions and perform other job related functions 
we believe that the power of our solutions can transform the way people use the internet  telecommunications systems  electronic medical records  wireless and mobile networks and related corporate infrastructure to conduct business 

table of contents strategy in fiscal  we will continue to focus on growth by providing market leading  value added solutions for our customers and partners through a broad set of technologies  service offerings and channel capabilities 
we have increased our focus on operating efficiencies  expense and hiring discipline and acquisition synergies to improve gross margins and operating margins 
we intend to pursue growth through the following key elements of our strategy extend technology leadership 
our solutions are recognized as among the best in their respective categories 
we intend to leverage our global research and development organization  and our broad portfolio of technologies  applications and intellectual property to foster technological innovation and to maintain customer preference for our solutions 
we also intend to invest further in our engineering resources and to seek new technological advancements that further expand the addressable markets for our solutions 
broaden expertise in vertical markets 
businesses are increasingly turning to nuance for comprehensive solutions rather than for a single technology product 
we intend to broaden our expertise and capabilities to continue to deliver targeted solutions for a range of industries including mobile device manufacturers  healthcare  telecommunications  financial services and government administration 
we also intend to expand our global sales and professional services capabilities to help our customers and partners design  integrate and deploy innovative solutions 
increase subscription and transaction based recurring revenue 
we intend to increase our subscription and transaction based offerings in all of our segments 
this will enable us to deliver applications that our customers use  and pay for  on a repeat basis  providing us with the opportunity to enjoy the benefits of recurring revenue streams 
expand global presence 
we intend to further expand our international resources to better serve our global customers and partners and to leverage opportunities in established markets such as europe  and also emerging markets such as asia and latin america 
we continue to add regional executives and sales employees across geographic regions to better address demand for voice and language based solutions and services 
pursue strategic acquisitions and partnerships 
we have selectively pursued strategic acquisitions to expand our technology  solutions and resources  and to complement our organic growth 
we have proven experience in integrating businesses and technologies to deliver enhanced value to our customers  partners  employees and shareholders 
we intend to continue to pursue acquisitions that enhance our solutions  serve specific vertical markets and strengthen our technology portfolio 
we have  however  recently slowed the pace and reduced the size of acquisitions to focus our resources more on driving organic growth 
we also have formed key partnerships with other important companies in our markets of interest  and intend to continue to do so in the future where it will enhance the value of our business 
key metrics in evaluating the financial condition and operating performance of our business  management focuses on revenue  net income  gross margins  operating margins and cash flow from operations 
a summary of these key financial metrics for the fiscal year ended september   as compared to the fiscal year ended september   is as follows total revenue increased by million to  million  net income declined by million to a loss of million  gross margins decreased by percentage points to  operating margins decreased by percentage points to  and cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended september  was million  a decrease of million from the prior fiscal year 
in addition to the above key financial metrics  we also focus on certain operating metrics 
a summary of these key operating metrics as of and for the period ended september  is as follows annualized line run rate in our on demand healthcare solutions increased to approximately billion lines per year 
the annualized line run rate is determined using billed equivalent line counts in a given quarter  multiplied by four  and total bookings during fiscal were billion which represent the contract value of transactions closed and recorded in the period as determined at the time of contract signing 
for fixed price contracts  the bookings value represents the total contract value 
for contracts where revenue is based on transaction volume  the bookings value represents the contract price times the estimated future transaction volume during the contract term  whether or not such transaction volumes are guaranteed under a minimum commitment clause 

table of contents estimated three year value of on demand contracts increased to approximately billion 
we determine this value as of the end of the period reported  by using our best estimate of three years of anticipated future revenue streams under signed on demand contracts then in place  whether or not they are guaranteed through a minimum commitment clause 
our best estimate is based on estimates used in evaluating the contracts and determining sales compensation  adjusted for changes in estimated launch dates  actual volumes achieved and other factors deemed relevant 
for contracts with an expiration date beyond three years  we include only the value expected within three years 
for other contracts  we assume renewal consistent with historic renewal rates unless there is a known cancellation 
contracts are generally priced by volume of usage and typically have no or low minimum commitments 
actual revenue could vary from our estimates due to factors such as cancellations  non renewals or volume fluctuations

other income  net for fiscal increased million  as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily driven by a million gain recognized on the original non controlling equity interest in vlingo upon our acquisition of vlingo during the third quarter of fiscal provision benefit for income taxes the following table shows the benefit provision for income taxes and the effective income tax rate dollars in millions fiscal fiscal fiscal change vs 
change vs 
provision benefit for income taxes effective income tax rate fiscal compared to fiscal our effective income tax rate was approximately in fiscal  compared to approximately in fiscal provision for income taxes increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal in fiscal  we recorded a release of valuation allowance totaling million as a result of tax benefits recorded in connection with our acquisitions during the period for which a net deferred tax liability was established in purchase accounting as well as a release of valuation allowance for which it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets were realizable 
in fiscal  no comparable benefit was recognized 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we determined that we had new negative evidence related to our domestic deferred tax asset recoverability assessment 
this new evidence  resulting from two consecutive quarterly reductions in our earnings forecast during fiscal  primarily due to the continuing shift toward on demand and ratable product offerings and revenue streams  led us to establish a valuation allowance against our net domestic deferred tax assets 
this valuation allowance was offset by the tax benefits from our current year domestic losses and credits 
we also recorded a million tax provision representing the establishment of the valuation allowance related to our net domestic deferred tax assets at the beginning of the year 
the effective income tax rate was also impacted by our foreign operations which are subject to a significantly lower tax rate than the us statutory tax rate 
this rate differential is driven by our subsidiaries in ireland 
in fiscal  this lower foreign tax rate differential was offset by the impact of the transfer of intangible property between certain of our foreign subsidiaries with significantly different local statutory tax rates 
although the transfer of intangible property between consolidated entities did not result in any gain in the consolidated results of operations  we generated a taxable gain in certain jurisdictions 
the future tax deductions associated with the amortization of the transferred intangibles will be generated in a jurisdiction that will not generate an offsetting tax benefit in future periods 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
fiscal compared to fiscal our effective income tax rate was and for fiscal and  respectively 
benefit from income taxes increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in benefit from income taxes included the release of our valuation allowance resulting from our acquisitions during fiscal and the recognition of certain deferred tax assets 
during fiscal  we recorded a release of valuation allowance of million as a result of tax benefits recorded in connection with our acquisitions during the period for which a net deferred tax liability was established in 
table of contents purchase accounting 
in addition  by the end of fiscal  we made a determination that it is more likely than not that certain of our deferred tax assets  primarily in the us  will be realized which resulted in a release of million of our valuation allowance 
our effective income tax rate is influenced by the level and mix of earnings and losses by taxing jurisdiction in combination with the applicable differences between us and foreign tax rates 
accordingly  changes in the jurisdictional mix of pre tax income in the current year can result in pre tax income being higher or lower than the prior year in countries with lower statutory tax rates  which causes our effective income tax rate to fluctuate 
the impact of such changes could be meaningful in countries with statutory income tax rates that are significantly lower than the us statutory income tax rate of 
in  we consolidated international sales and financial management in a newly created international headquarters in dublin  ireland 
this irish entity is our principal entity selling to customers in countries outside of north america and japan 
in years before fiscal  sales to these regions were made by our subsidiary in belgium pursuant to a license which returned most of the belgium profits back to the us through a royalty arrangement 
in connection with the establishment of the international headquarters in dublin  we implemented a new intellectual property strategy pursuant to which the right to use us owned intellectual property now resides with our irish headquarter entity 
while our ireland subsidiaries make royalty and other payments to the us  the majority of profits earned by the irish entities are retained offshore to fund our future growth in europe  the middle east  africa and the asia pacific regions 
in future periods  if our foreign profits grow  we expect substantially all of our income before income taxes from foreign operations will be earned in ireland 
the statutory rate related to our ireland profits is lower than the u 
s  statutory rate and as a result we would expect our effective tax rate to decrease as profits in ireland increase 
segment analysis we operate in  and report financial information for  the following four reportable segments healthcare  mobile and consumer  enterprise and imaging 
segment revenues include certain revenue adjustments related to acquisitions that would otherwise have been recognized but for the purchase accounting treatment of the business combinations 
segment revenues also include revenue that we would have otherwise recognized had we not acquired intellectual property and other assets from the same customer 
we include these revenues and the related cost of revenues to allow for more complete comparisons to the financial results of historical operations  forward looking guidance and the financial results of peer companies and in assessing management performance 
segment profit is an important measure used for evaluating performance and for decision making purposes 
segment profit reflects the direct controllable costs of each segment together with an allocation of sales and corporate marketing expenses  and certain research and development project costs that benefit multiple product offerings 
segment profit represents income from operations excluding stock based compensation  amortization of intangible assets  acquisition related costs  net  restructuring and other charges  net  costs associated with intellectual property collaboration agreements  other income expense  net and certain unallocated corporate expenses

the debentures are puttable at the holders option in august as a result  we have classified the obligation in current liabilities at september  our stock price exceeded the conversion threshold price of per share for at least days during the consecutive trading days ended september  accordingly  the debentures were convertible at the holders option during the quarter ended december  and therefore were classified as current liabilities at september  the difference between the carrying value of the debentures and the million principal amount reflects the unamortized portion of the original issue discount recognized upon issuance of the notes  which is being amortized over the expected term of the convertible debt 
because the debentures were convertible at september   an amount equal to the million unamortized portion of the original issue discount was separately classified in our consolidated balance sheets as temporary equity and referred to as equity component of currently redeemable convertible debentures 
at september   we have no temporary equity 

table of contents credit facility on august   we entered into an amendment agreement to amend and restate our existing amended and restated credit agreement  as previously amended 
the credit agreement was originally dated march   and was amended and restated on april   and further amended and restated on july   and includes a term loan and a million revolving credit line including letters of credit together  the credit facility

principal payments on the term loan of million are due in quarterly installments of million through august  at which point the remaining balance becomes due 
in addition  an annual excess cash flow sweep  as defined in the credit facility  is payable in the first quarter of each fiscal year  based on the excess cash flow generated in the previous fiscal year 
we have not generated excess cash flows in any period and no additional payments are required 
we will continue to evaluate the extent to which a payment is due in the first quarter of future fiscal years based on excess cash flow generation 
at the current time  we are unable to predict the amount of the outstanding principal  if any  that may be required to be repaid in future fiscal years pursuant to the excess cash flow sweep provisions 
any term loan borrowings not paid through the baseline repayment  the excess cash flow sweep  or any other mandatory or optional payments that we may make  will be repaid upon maturity

share repurchase program on april   our board of directors approved a share repurchase program for up to million of our outstanding shares of common stock 
approximately million remained available for stock repurchases as of september   pursuant to our stock repurchase program 
we repurchased million shares for million during the year ended september  these shares were retired upon repurchase 
under the terms of the repurchase program  we expect to continue to repurchase shares from time to time through a variety of methods  which may include open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  block trades  accelerated stock repurchase transactions  or any combination of such methods 
the timing and the amount of any purchases will be determined by management based on an evaluation of market conditions  capital allocation alternatives  and other factors 
the share repurchase program does not require us to acquire any specific number of shares and may be modified  suspended  extended or terminated by us at any time without prior notice

total sublease income under contractual terms is expected to be million  which ranges from million to million on an annualized basis through the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits as of september  was million 
we do not expect a significant change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next months 
we estimate that none of this amount will be paid within the next year and we are currently unable to reasonably estimate the timing of payments for the remainder of the liability 
contingent liabilities and commitments in connection with some of our acquisitions  we agreed to make contingent cash payments to the former shareholders of certain of the acquired companies 
the following represents the contingent cash payments that we may be required to make

the payment is due in october and is contingent upon the continued employment of certain named executives and certain other conditions 
the contingent payments will be reduced by amounts specified in the merger agreement in the event that any of the named executives terminates their employment prior to the payment date 
financial instruments we use financial instruments to manage our foreign exchange risk 
we follow financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification asc  derivatives and hedging  for our derivative instruments 
we operate our business in countries throughout the world and transact business in various foreign currencies 
our foreign currency exposures typically arise from transactions denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency of our operations 
we have a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
we established this program so that gains and losses from remeasurement or settlement of these assets and liabilities are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts thus mitigating the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions 
generally  we enter into contracts with terms of days or less  and at september  we had outstanding contracts with a total notional value of million 
from time to time we will enter into agreements that allow us to issue shares of our common stock as part or all of the consideration related to partnering and technology acquisition activities 
generally these shares are issued subject to security price guarantees which are accounted for as derivatives 
we have determined that these instruments would not be considered equity instruments if they were freestanding 
the security price guarantees require payment from either us to the third party  or from the third party to us  based upon the difference between the price of our common stock on the issue date and an average price of our common stock approximately six months following the issue date 
changes in the fair value of these security price guarantees are reported in earnings in each period as other expense income  net 
during the year ended september   and  we recorded million  million and million  respectively of losses gains associated with these contracts and paid received cash payments totaling million  million and million  respectively  upon to settlement of the agreements during the year 
pension plans we sponsor certain defined benefit pension plans that are offered primarily by certain of our foreign subsidiaries

our total defined benefit plan pension expenses were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the aggregate projected benefit obligation and aggregate net asset liability of our defined benefit plans as of september  was million and million  respectively  and as of september  was million and million  respectively

the loss on settlement was million  and is included in restructuring and other  net 
off balance sheet arrangements through september   we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements or material transactions with unconsolidated entities or other persons 

table of contents critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  assumptions and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets  accounting for business combinations  accounting for stock based compensation  accounting for derivative instruments  accounting for income taxes and related valuation allowances  and loss contingencies 
our management bases its estimates on historical experience  market participant fair value considerations and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies most significantly affect the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult and subjective judgments 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenue from the following sources software license agreements  including royalty and other usage based arrangements  professional services  hosting services and post contract customer support pcs 
our hosting services are generally provided through on demand  usage based or per transaction fee arrangements 
our revenue recognition policies for these revenue streams are discussed below 
the sale and or license of software products and technology is deemed to have occurred when a customer either has taken possession of or has access to take immediate possession of the software or technology 
in select situations  we sell or license intellectual property in conjunction with  or in place of  embedding our intellectual property in software 
we also have non software arrangements including hosting services where the customer does not take possession of the software at the outset of the arrangement either because they have no contractual right to do so or because significant penalties preclude them from doing so 
generally we recognize revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the fee is fixed or determinable and iv collectibility is probable 
revenue from royalties on sales of our software products by original equipment manufacturers oems  where no services are included  is recognized in the quarter earned so long as we have been notified by the oem that such royalties are due  and provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
software arrangements generally include pcs  which includes telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades enhancements on a when and if available basis  typically for one to five years 
revenue from pcs is recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the term that the maintenance service is provided 
when pcs renews automatically  we provide a reserve based on historical experience for contracts expected to be canceled for non payment 
all known and estimated cancellations are recorded as a reduction to revenue and accounts receivable 
for our software and software related multiple element arrangements  where customers purchase both software related products and software related services  we use vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for software and software related services to separate the elements and account for them separately 
vsoe exists when a company can support what the fair value of its software and or software related services is based on evidence of the prices charged when the same elements are sold separately 
vsoe of fair value is required  generally  in order to separate the accounting for various elements in a software and related services arrangement 
we have established vsoe of fair value for the majority of our pcs  professional services  and training 
when we provide professional services considered essential to the functionality of the software  we recognize revenue from the professional services as well as any related software licenses on a percentage of completion basis whereby the arrangement consideration is recognized as the services are performed  as measured by an observable input 
in these circumstances  we separate license revenue from professional service revenue for income statement presentation by allocating vsoe of fair value of the professional services as professional services and hosting revenue and the residual portion as product and licensing revenue 
we generally determine the percentage of completion by comparing the labor hours incurred to date to the estimated total labor hours required to complete the project 
we consider labor hours to be the most reliable  available measure of progress on these projects 
adjustments to estimates to complete are made in the periods in which facts resulting in a change become known 
when the estimate indicates that a loss will be incurred  such loss is recorded in the period identified 
significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the percent complete of each contract 
different assumptions could yield materially different results 
we offer some of our products via a software as a service saas model also known as a hosted model 
in this type of arrangement  we are compensated in two ways fees for up front set up of the service environment and fees charged on a 
table of contents usage or per transaction basis 
our up front set up fees are nonrefundable 
we recognize the up front set up fees ratably over the longer of the contract lives  or the expected lives of the customer relationships 
the on demand  usage based or per transaction fees are due and payable as each individual transaction is processed through the hosted service and is recognized as revenue in the period the services are provided 
we enter into multiple element arrangements that may include a combination of our various software related and non software related products and services offerings including software licenses  pcs  professional services  and our hosting services 
in such arrangements we allocate total arrangement consideration to software or software related elements and any non software element separately based on the selling price hierarchy group following the guidance in accounting standards codification asc  software revenue recognition and our policies 
we determine the selling price for each deliverable using vsoe of selling price  if it exists  or third party evidence tpe of selling price 
typically  we are unable to determine tpe of selling price 
therefore  when neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exist for a deliverable  we use our estimate of selling price esp for the purposes of allocating the arrangement consideration 
we determine esp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  major project groupings  market conditions  competitive landscape  price list and discounting practices 
revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria are met for each element 
when products are sold through distributors or resellers  title and risk of loss generally passes upon shipment  at which time the transaction is invoiced and payment is due 
shipments to distributors and resellers without right of return are recognized as revenue upon shipment  provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
certain distributors and resellers have been granted rights of return for as long as the distributors or resellers hold the inventory 
we cannot estimate historical returns from these distributors and resellers  and therefore  cannot use such estimates as the basis upon which to estimate future sales returns 
as a result  we recognize revenue from sales to these distributors and resellers when the products are sold through to retailers and end users 
when products are sold directly to retailers or end users  we make an estimate of sales returns based on historical experience 
the provision for these estimated returns is recorded as a reduction of revenue and accounts receivable at the time that the related revenue is recorded 
if actual returns differ significantly from our estimates  such differences could have a material impact on our results of operations for the period in which the actual returns become known 
we record consideration given to a reseller as a reduction of revenue to the extent we have recorded cumulative revenue from the customer or reseller 
however  when we receive an identifiable benefit in exchange for the consideration  and can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received  the consideration is recorded as an operating expense 
we record reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses as revenue  with offsetting costs recorded as cost of revenue 
out of pocket expenses generally include  but are not limited to  expenses related to transportation  lodging and meals 
we record shipping and handling costs billed to customers as revenue with offsetting costs recorded as cost of revenue 
our revenue recognition policies require management to make significant estimates 
management analyzes various factors  including a review of specific transactions  historical experience  creditworthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions 
changes in judgments based upon these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue and cost recognized and thus affects our results of operations and financial condition 
business combinations 
we determine and allocate the purchase price of an acquired company to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the business combination date 
the purchase price allocation process requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions  including fair value estimates  as of the business acquisition date  including estimated fair values of intangible assets  estimated fair market values of legal performance commitments to customers  assumed from the acquiree under existing contractual obligations classified as deferred revenue at the date of acquisition  estimated fair market values of stock awards assumed from the acquiree that are included in the purchase price  estimated fair market value of required payments under contingent consideration provisions  estimated income tax assets and liabilities assumed from the acquiree  and estimated fair value of pre acquisition contingencies assumed from the acquiree 

table of contents while we use our best estimates and assumptions as part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the business combination date  our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement 
as a result  during the purchase price allocation period  which is generally one year from the business combination date  we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  with the corresponding offset to goodwill 
for changes in the valuation of intangible assets between preliminary and final purchase price allocation  the related amortization is adjusted effective from the acquisition date 
subsequent to the purchase price allocation period any adjustment to assets acquired or liabilities assumed is included in operating results in the period in which the adjustment is determined 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from software license sales  support agreements  consulting contracts  other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop in process research and development projects into commercially viable products and the estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand and competitive position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
in connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions  we estimate the fair market value of legal performance commitments to customers  which are classified as deferred revenue 
the estimated fair market value of these obligations is determined and recorded as of the acquisition date 
for a given acquisition  we may identify certain pre acquisition contingencies 
if  during the purchase price allocation period  we are able to determine the fair value of a pre acquisition contingency  we will include that amount in the purchase price allocation 
if we are unable to determine the fair value of a pre acquisition contingency at the end of the purchase price allocation period  we will evaluate whether to include an amount in the purchase price allocation based on whether it is probable a liability had been incurred and whether an amount can be reasonably estimated 
after the end of the purchase price allocation period  any adjustment to amounts recorded for a pre acquisition contingency will be included in our operating results as acquisition related cost  net in the period in which the adjustment is determined 
goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets and impairment assessments 
we have significant long lived tangible and intangible assets  including goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  which are susceptible to valuation adjustments as a result of changes in various factors or conditions 
the most significant finite lived tangible and intangible assets are customer relationships  licensed technology  patents and core technology  completed technology  fixed assets and trade names 
all finite lived intangible assets are amortized over the estimated economic lives of the assets  generally using the straight line method except where the pattern of the expected economic benefit is readily identifiable  primarily customer relationship intangibles  whereby amortization follows that pattern 
the values of intangible assets determined in connection with a business combination  with the exception of goodwill  were initially determined by a risk adjusted  discounted cash flow approach 
we assess the potential impairment of intangible and fixed assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed for potential impairment at least annually  but also whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment of such assets  include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and a decline in our market capitalization below net book value 

table of contents future adverse changes in these or other unforeseeable factors could result in an impairment charge that would materially impact future results of operations and financial position in the reporting period identified 
we test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually in the fourth quarter  and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives compares the fair value of identified reporting unit s to its their carrying amount to assess whether such assets are impaired 
we have six reporting units based on the level of information provided to  and review thereof  by our segment management 
we determine fair values for each of the reporting units using an income approach 
when available and appropriate  we also use a comparative market approach to derive the fair values 
for purposes of the income approach  fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows  discounted at an appropriate risk adjusted rate 
we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of long term future growth rates based on our most recent views of the long term outlook for each business 
actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts 
we derive our discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to our reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing 
we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective businesses and in our internally developed forecasts 
discount rates used in our reporting unit valuations ranged from to 
for purposes of the market approach  we use a valuation technique in which values are derived based on market prices of comparable publicly traded companies 
we also use a market based valuation technique in which values are determined based on relevant observable information generated by market transactions involving comparable businesses 
compared to the market approach  the income approach more closely aligns each reporting unit valuation to our business profile  including geographic markets served and product offerings 
required rates of return  along with uncertainty inherent in the forecasts of future cash flows  are reflected in the selection of the discount rate 
equally important  under this approach  reasonably likely scenarios and associated sensitivities can be developed for alternative future states that may not be reflected in an observable market price 
a market approach allows for comparison to actual market transactions and multiples 
it can be somewhat more limited in its application because the population of potential comparable entities is often limited to publicly traded companies where the characteristics of the comparative business and ours can be significantly different  market data is usually not available for divisions within larger conglomerates or non public subsidiaries that could otherwise qualify as comparable  and the specific circumstances surrounding a market transaction eg  synergies between the parties  terms and conditions of the transaction  etc 
may be different or irrelevant with respect to our business 
it can also be difficult  under certain market conditions  to identify orderly transactions between market participants in similar businesses 
we assess each valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation and weight the methodologies appropriately 
the carrying values of the reporting units were determined based on an allocation of our assets and liabilities through specific allocation of certain assets and liabilities  to the reporting units and an apportionment method based on relative size of the reporting units revenues and operating expenses compared to the company as a whole 
goodwill was initially allocated to our reporting units based on the relative fair value of the units at the date we implemented the current reporting unit structure 
goodwill subsequently acquired through acquisitions is allocated to the applicable reporting unit based upon the relative fair value of the acquired business 
certain corporate assets that are not instrumental to the reporting units operations and would not be transferred to hypothetical purchasers of the reporting units were excluded from the reporting units carrying values 
based on our assessments  we have not had any impairment charges during our history as a result of our impairment evaluation of goodwill 
significant adverse changes in our future revenues and or cash flow results  or significant degradation in the enterprise values of comparable companies within our segments  could result in the determination that all or a portion of our goodwill is impaired 
however  as of our fiscal annual impairment assessment date  our estimated fair values of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values 
we periodically review long lived assets other than goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of those assets are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the recorded carrying value for the asset or asset group 
asset groups utilized in this analysis are identified as the lowest level grouping of assets for which largely independent cash flows can be identified 
if impairment is indicated  the asset or asset group is written down to its estimated fair value 
significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the useful lives of our long lived assets  determining the reporting units and assessing when events or circumstances would require an interim impairment analysis of goodwill or other long lived assets to be performed 
changes in our organization or management reporting structure  as well as other events and circumstances  including but not limited to technological advances  increased competition and changing economic or market conditions  could result in a shorter estimated useful lives  b changes to reporting units  which may require alternative methods of estimating fair values or greater disaggregation or aggregation in our analysis by reporting unit  and or c other changes in 
table of contents previous assumptions or estimates 
in turn  this could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements through accelerated amortization and or impairment charges 
accounting for stock based compensation 
we account for share based awards to employees and directors  including grants of employee stock options  purchases under employee stock purchase plans  and restricted awards through recognition of the fair value of the share based awards as a charge against earnings in the form of stock based compensation expense 
we recognize stock based compensation expense over the requisite service period  net of estimated forfeitures 
we recognize benefits from stock based compensation in equity using the with and without approach for the utilization of tax attributes 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating expected dividends  share price volatility and the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
income taxes 
in accordance with accounting standards codification  income taxes asc  we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach  which requires that the deferred tax consequences of temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the amounts included in our federal  state and foreign income tax returns to be recognized in the balance sheet 
as the income tax returns are not due and filed until after the completion of our annual financial reporting requirements  the amounts recorded for the current period reflect estimates for the tax based activity for the period 
in addition  estimates are often required with respect to  among other things  the appropriate state income tax rates to use in the various states that we and our subsidiaries are required to file  the potential utilization of operating loss carry forwards and valuation allowances required  if any  for tax assets that may not be realizable in the future 
asc requires balance sheet classification of current and long term deferred income tax assets and liabilities based upon the classification of the underlying asset or liability that gives rise to a temporary difference 
as such  we have historically estimated the future tax consequence of certain items  including bad debts  inventory valuation  and accruals that cannot be deducted for income tax purposes until such expenses are actually paid 
we believe the procedures and estimates used in our accounting for income taxes are reasonable and in accordance with established tax law 
the income tax estimates used have not resulted in material adjustments to income tax expense in subsequent periods when the estimates are adjusted to the actual filed tax return amounts 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we do not provide for us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  which we consider to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the us we make judgments regarding the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
the balance sheet carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on whether we believe that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets after consideration of all available evidence 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets 
the weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified 
as such  it is generally difficult for positive evidence regarding projected future taxable income exclusive of reversing taxable temporary differences to outweigh objective negative evidence of recent financial reporting losses 
generally  cumulative loss in recent years is a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome in determining that a valuation allowance is not needed 
by the end of fiscal  our us operations had pre tax income adjusted for permanent differences for the most recent three year period 
we concluded that this record of cumulative profitability in recent years and our business plan showing continued profitability provided assurance that our future tax benefits more likely than not would be realized 
accordingly  by the end of fiscal  we made a determination that it is more likely than not that certain of our deferred taxes  primarily in the us  would be realized which resulted in a release of million of our valuation allowance 
as of september   we had net domestic deferred tax assets that totaled million 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we concluded that the recoverability of our net domestic deferred tax assets is not more likely than not due to two consecutive quarterly reductions in our earnings forecast  primarily due to the continuing shift toward on demand and ratable product offerings and revenue streams 
this represented new negative evidence related to our domestic deferred tax asset recoverability assessment during fiscal the new evidence led us to establish a valuation allowance  offsetting the tax benefits resulting from our current year domestic losses 
we also recorded a million tax provision representing the establishment of the valuation allowance related to our net domestic deferred tax assets at the beginning of the year 
as of september   we have million of valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets 
as of september   we have million of valuation allowances recorded against all us deferred tax assets and certain foreign deferred tax assets 
if we are subsequently able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which the 
table of contents remaining valuation allowance has been established  then we may be required to recognize these deferred tax assets through the reduction of the valuation allowance which could result in a material benefit to our results of operations in the period in which the benefit is determined 
we establish reserves for tax uncertainties that reflect the use of the comprehensive model for the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions 
under the comprehensive model  when the minimum threshold for recognition is not met  no tax benefit can be recorded 
when the minimum threshold for recognition is met  a tax position is recorded as the largest amount that is more than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
loss contingencies 
we are subject to legal proceedings  lawsuits and other claims relating to labor  service and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business  as discussed in note of notes to our consolidated financial statements 
quarterly  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward  a similar tax loss  or a tax credit carryforward exists asu to provide guidance on the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits 
asu requires an entity to present an unrecognized tax benefit  or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit  as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward  a similar tax loss  or a tax credit carryforward  except as follows to the extent a net operating loss carryforward  a similar tax loss  or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position or the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction does not require the entity to use  and the entity does not intend to use  the deferred tax asset for such purpose  the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets 
asu is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal with earlier adoption permitted 
asu should be applied prospectively with retroactive application permitted 
we do not believe that this will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update no 
 reporting amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  which amends accounting standards codification  comprehensive income 
the amended guidance requires entities to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
additionally  entities are required to present  either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income 
the amended guidance does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income 
the amendment is effective prospectively for annual periods  and interim periods within those annual periods  beginning after december  we believe adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements as these updates have an impact on presentation only 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and equity prices which could affect operating results  financial position and cash flows 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and  when appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
exchange rate sensitivity we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
any foreign currency transaction  defined as a transaction denominated in a currency other than the us dollar  will be reported in us dollars at the applicable exchange rate 
assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense items are translated at average rates for the period 
the primary foreign currency denominated transactions include revenue and expenses and the resulting accounts receivable and accounts payable balances reflected on our balance sheet 
therefore  the change in the value of the us dollar compared to foreign currencies will have either a positive or negative effect on our financial position and results of operations 
historically  our primary exposure has related to transactions denominated in the euro  british pound  canadian dollar  japanese yen  indian rupee and hungarian forint 
a hypothetical change of in appreciation or depreciation in foreign currency exchange rates from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at september  would not have a material impact on our revenue  operating results or cash flows in the coming year 
periodically  we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge against foreign currency fluctuations 
these contracts may or may not be designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 
we have in place a program which primarily uses forward contracts to offset the risks associated with foreign currency exposures that arise from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our worldwide operations 
the program is designed so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gain or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts 
these contracts are not designated 
table of contents as accounting hedges and generally are for periods less than days 
the notional contract amount of outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts not designated as cash flow hedges was million at september  based on the nature of the transactions for which the contracts were purchased  a hypothetical change of in exchange rates would not have a material impact on our financial results 
interest rate sensitivity we are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our significant cash and cash equivalents  and the outstanding debt under the credit facility 
at september   we held approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities primarily consisting of cash and money market funds 
due to the low current market yields and the short term nature of our investments  a hypothetical change in market rates of one percentage point would not have a material effect on the fair value of our portfolio 
assuming a one percentage point increase in interest rates  our interest income on our investments classified as cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities would increase approximately million  based on the september  reported balances of our investment accounts 
at september   our total outstanding debt balance exposed to variable interest rates was million 
a hypothetical change in market rates would have a significant impact on interest expense and amounts payable 
assuming a one percentage point increase in interest rates  our interest expense relative to our outstanding variable rate debt would increase million per annum 
equity price risk we are exposed to equity price risk as a result of security price guarantees that we enter in to from time to time 
generally  these price guarantees are for a period of six months or less  and require payment from either us to a third party  or from the third party to us  based upon changes in our stock price during the contract term 
as of september   we have security price guarantees outstanding for approximately million shares of our common stock 
a change in our stock price during the next six months would not have a material impact on our statements of operations or cash flows 
and debentures the fair value of our and debentures is dependent on the price and volatility of our common stock as well as movements in interest rates 
the fair market value of the debentures will generally increase or decrease as the market price of our common stock changes 
the fair market value of the debentures will generally increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the market value and interest rate changes affect the fair market value of the debentures  but do not impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations 
however  increases in the value of our common stock above the stated trigger price for each issuance for a specified period of time may provide the holders of the debentures the right to convert each bond using a conversion ratio and payment method as defined in the debenture agreement 
our debentures trade in the financial markets  and the fair value at september  was million for the debentures and million for the debentures  based on an average of the bid and ask prices for each of the issuances on that day 
this compares to conversion values on september  of approximately million and million for the debentures and the debentures  respectively 
a increase in the stock price over the september  closing price of would have an estimated combined million increase to the fair value and a combined million increase to the conversion value of the debentures 
given the current trading value of the debentures  the greatest value to the holders of the debentures would be to sell the debentures in the open market in order to maximize their return 
based on this  we believe that the holders may not have a significant economic incentive to convert prior to the first redemption date
