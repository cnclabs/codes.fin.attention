item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a clinical stage biotechnology company engaged in the discovery and development of novel synthetic dna and rna based drug candidates that are designed to modulate immune responses mediated through toll like receptors  or tlrs 
we are focusing our development efforts on the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases 
we have two drug candidates  imo  a tlr and tlr antagonist  and imo  a tlr  tlr  and tlr antagonist  in clinical development for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases 
we recently announced top line data from a phase clinical trial of imo in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis 
we believe that the results of this trial provide clinical proof of concept for our approach of targeting specific tlrs for the treatment of psoriasis and potentially other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases 
tlrs are specific receptors present in immune system cells 
using a chemistry based approach  we have created synthetic dna and rna based compounds that are targeted to tlr  tlr  tlr  and tlr a tlr antagonist is a compound that blocks activation of an immune response through the targeted tlr 
a tlr agonist is a compound that stimulates an immune response through the targeted tlr 
we believe that the modulation of immune responses through tlrs provides a rationale for the development of drug candidates to treat a broad range of diseases  including autoimmune and inflammatory diseases  cancer and respiratory diseases  and for use as vaccine adjuvants 
we are a party to a collaboration alliance with merck sharp dohme corp 
formerly merck co  inc  or merck co  for the use of agonists of tlr  tlr  and tlr as adjuvants in the development of vaccines for cancer  infectious diseases  and alzheimer s disease 
we are seeking to enter into additional collaborative alliances with third parties with respect to our tlr targeted programs in oncology  hematological malignancies  respiratory diseases  and the use of tlr agonists as vaccine adjuvants 
we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million at december  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations at least into the third quarter of based on our current operating plan  including the completion of our ongoing phase clinical trial of imo in healthy subjects that we initiated in the fourth quarter of  and preparations for the further advancement of our autoimmune and inflammatory disease program  including preparations for a planned phase clinical trial of imo in patients with psoriasis 
we will need to raise additional funds prior to the end of the second quarter of in order to further advance our autoimmune and inflammatory disease program  commence any clinical trials and operate our business and continue as a going concern 
although we are exploring financing alternatives  financing may not be available to us in the necessary time frame  in the amounts that we need  on terms that are acceptable to us or at all 
if we are unable to raise the necessary funds by late in the second quarter of  we expect that we will terminate our operations and pursue a liquidation of the company through a sale or license of assets or a possible bankruptcy 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur substantial operating losses in future periods 
we do not expect to generate significant product revenue  sales based milestones or royalties until we successfully complete development and obtain marketing approval for drug candidates  either alone or in collaborations with third parties  which we expect will take a number of years 
in order to commercialize our drug candidates  we need to complete clinical development and to comply with comprehensive regulatory requirements 
critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the 
table of contents reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  stock based compensation and our series d redeemable convertible preferred stock and related common stock warrants 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we regard an accounting estimate or assumption underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate where the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
not all of these significant policies  however  fit the definition of critical accounting policies and estimates 
we believe that our accounting policies relating to revenue recognition  stock based compensation and convertible preferred stock and related common stock warrants fit the description of critical accounting estimates and judgments 
revenue recognition an important part of our business strategy is to enter into research and development collaborations with biotechnology and pharmaceutical corporations that bring expertise and resources to the potential research and development and commercialization of drugs based on our technology 
under our research and development collaborations  we have generally licensed specified portions of our intellectual property and provided research and development services to the collaborator during the period of continued involvement in the early portion of the collaborations 
our collaborators have generally been responsible for drug development activities initiated after the collaboration is effective 
our collaborators are also generally responsible for any commercialization activities that may be initiated if any of the drug candidates receive marketing approval from the appropriate regulatory authority 
the terms of our agreements have included non refundable license fees  research and development funding  payments based upon achievement of clinical and preclinical development milestones and royalties on product sales 
the following revenue recognition policy incorporates accounting standard update  or asu  no 
 multiple element revenue arrangements and asu no 
 milestone method of revenue recognition both of which we adopted on january  these new accounting standards did not affect revenue that we earned through december  we plan to follow no 
prospectively for any arrangements entered into or materially modified after the adoption date 
we plan to follow asu no 
prospectively for any future milestones 
when evaluating multiple element arrangements  we consider whether the components of the arrangement represent separate units of accounting based on specified criteria such as whether the deliverable has standalone value to the collaborator 
any fixed or determinable payments that we expect to receive under the arrangement are allocated among the separate units of accounting and the appropriate revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of these separate units 
any item that does not qualify as a separate unit of accounting is combined with other appropriate items and the combined deliverable is treated as a separate unit of accounting 
our allocation of fixed or determinable payments to the separate units of accounting is based on the relative selling price method  which is based on the following hierarchy used in determining the selling price for each unit of accounting vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  the price at which the item is regularly sold by the vendor on a standalone basis  is the preferred method  third party evidence  or tpe  of vendors selling 
table of contents similar goods to similarly situated customers on a standalone basis if vsoe of selling price of a product or service is not available  and best estimate of selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price of a product or service is available 
our timing of revenue recognition from upfront license fees received under collaboration agreements depends upon the terms of the agreement 
we recognize revenue from reimbursements earned in connection with research and development collaboration agreements as related research and development costs are incurred  and contractual services are performed  provided collectability is reasonably assured 
we include amounts contractually owed to us under these research and development collaboration agreements  including any earned but unbilled receivables  in receivables in our balance sheets 
our principal costs under these agreements are generally for our personnel and related expenses of conducting research and development  as well as for research and development performed by outside contractors or consultants or related research and development materials provided by third parties or for clinical trials we conduct on behalf of a collaborator 
for payments that are contingent upon milestone events or achieving a specific result from the research and development efforts  we recognize these milestone payments as revenue in their entirety upon achieving the related milestone provided the milestone meets the criteria specified below 
milestones typically consist of significant events in the development life cycle of the related technology  such as initiating clinical trials  filing for approval with regulatory agencies  and obtaining approvals from regulatory agencies 
we recognize revenue from milestone payments received under collaboration agreements in their entirety upon achieving the related milestone  provided that the milestone event is substantive  its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  the amount attributed to the milestone is reasonable in relation to our performance and to the amounts attributed to the other deliverables in the arrangement and we have no further performance obligations relating to the milestone event 
in the event that the agreement provides for payment to be made subsequent to our standard payment terms  we recognize revenue when payment becomes due 
amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in our balance sheets 
we classify amounts that we expect to recognize in the next twelve months as short term deferred revenue 
we classify amounts that we do not expect to recognize within the next twelve months as long term deferred revenue 
although we follow detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
for example  we record deferred revenue  if any  on our balance sheet as short term or long term deferred revenue based on our best estimate of when such amounts would be recognized 
however  these estimates are based on our collaboration agreement and our then current operating plan and  if either should change  we could recognize a different amount of deferred revenue over the subsequent twelve month period 
our estimate of deferred revenue also reflects our estimate of the periods of our involvement in our collaborations and the estimated periods over which our performance obligations will be completed 
in some instances  the timing of satisfying these obligations can be difficult to estimate 
accordingly  our estimates may change in subsequent periods 
such changes to estimates would result in a change in revenue recognition amounts 
if these estimates and judgments change over the course of these agreements  it may affect the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize and record in subsequent periods 
stock based compensation we recognize all share based payments to employees and directors as expense in our statements of operations and comprehensive loss based on their fair values 
we record compensation expense over an award s requisite service period  or vesting period  based on the award s fair value at the date of grant 
our policy is to charge the fair value of stock options as an expense  adjusted for forfeitures  on a straight line basis over the vesting period  which is generally four years for employees and three years for directors 
prior to december  the vesting of all of our stock options was based on the passage of time and the employees continued 
table of contents service 
in december and january  we granted performance based stock options to purchase  shares of common stock to employees 
as of the grant date of such options  options to purchase  shares were to vest immediately upon the achievement of various performance conditions and options to purchase  shares were to vest over a three year service period upon the achievement of the same performance conditions 
during we achieved three of the specified performance conditions 
as a result  options to purchase  shares vested immediately and options to purchase  shares began vesting over a three year period in accordance with the terms of the performance based options 
in addition  during  four of the specified performance conditions were not met by their deadlines resulting in the cancellation of  performance based options 
we recognize expense over the implicit and explicit service periods for awards with performance conditions when we determine the achievement of the performance conditions to be probable 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants 
the black scholes model relies on a number of key assumptions to calculate estimated fair values  including assumptions as to average risk free interest rate  expected dividend yield  expected life and expected volatility 
for the assumed risk free interest rate  we use the us treasury security rate with a term equal to the expected life of the option 
our assumed dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends to common stockholders and have no present intention to pay cash dividends 
we use an expected option life based on actual experience 
our assumption for expected volatility is based on the actual stock price volatility over a period equal to the expected life of the option 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the stock based compensation expense we recognize in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income loss  net income loss and earnings loss per share 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
these characteristics are not present in our option grants 
although the black scholes option pricing model is widely used  existing valuation models  including the black scholes valuation model  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
we recorded charges of million  million  and million in our statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the years ended december   and  respectively  for stock compensation expense attributable to share based payments made to employees and directors 
the decrease in stock compensation expense for  as compared to  was primarily due to decreases in the expense associated with employee options granted before and director options granted before the decrease in stock compensation expense for  as compared to  was primarily due to decreases in the expense associated with employee options granted before and director options granted before  as well as stock compensation expense associated with the modification of stock options during as a result of our adoption of policies on the treatment of options in connection with director or employee retirement 
convertible preferred stock and warrants series d redeemable convertible preferred stock and warrants on november   we received net proceeds of million from the sale and issuance of shares of our series d redeemable convertible preferred stock  or series d preferred stock  and related warrants to purchase shares of our common stock  or series d warrants 
we first assessed these financial instruments under accounting standards codification  or asc  distinguishing liabilities from equity  and determined that neither financial instrument was within the scope of asc we then assessed these financial instruments under asc  derivatives and hedging as follows series d warrants 
we determined that the series d warrants were a derivative instrument as they contained a price protection feature that causes the series d warrants to not be considered indexed to the 
table of contents company s own stock and to therefore not be qualified for the exemption requirements in asc we recorded the series d warrants as a liability at fair value as of the november  transaction date and marked the recorded amount to fair value through earnings each quarter 
the fair value of the series d warrants was million on the november  transaction date and million at december  the million decrease in the fair value between november  and december  was recorded as non operating income in the fair value of the series d warrant liability decreased from million at december  to million at november   the date on which we sold shares of our series e convertible preferred stock  or series e preferred stock  and related warrants to purchase shares of our common stock  or series e warrants  in a financing transaction  resulting in the recognition of million in non operating income in the sale of shares of series e preferred stock and series e warrants in our november series e financing triggered an anti dilution adjustment under the terms of the series d warrants  resulting in the exercise price of the series d warrants being reduced and fixed at the minimum price of per share 
as a result  the series d warrants are no longer being subject to any anti dilution adjustments and now meet the exception under asc as they were now considered indexed to the company s own stock and met certain criteria for equity classification 
accordingly  we marked the series d warrants to fair value through earnings as of november   and reclassified the remaining million balance of the series d warrant liability to stockholders equity at that time 
series d redeemable convertible preferred stock 
we determined that the series d preferred stock contained three embedded features optional redemption by the company  optional redemption by the holder and optional conversion by the holder 
we determined that each of the embedded features met the definition of a derivative 
we determined that the series d preferred stock should be considered an equity host for the purposes of assessing the embedded derivatives for potential bifurcation 
we noted the following regarding these embedded features optional redemption by the company and optional redemption by the holder 
we assessed the redemption features under asc to determine if they were eligible for the exemption from derivative accounting 
in order to meet the exemption the feature must be indexed to the company s own stock and meet specified criteria for equity classification 
we determined that both redemption features met these requirements and were not bifurcated 
optional conversion by the holder 
we determined that the optional conversion by holder feature was clearly and closely related to the series d preferred stock host 
as such the conversion feature did not require bifurcation under asc we then assessed the series d preferred stock under asc  debt  to determine if there was a beneficial conversion feature  or bcf 
we determined the value of the bcf by comparing the million financing proceeds allocated to the series d preferred stock  computed by reducing the million gross proceeds from the series d financing by the million fair value of the series d warrants  to the million intrinsic value of the common stock that the series d preferred stock could be converted into on the date of the series d financing 
based on this comparison  we determined the bcf to be million which we recorded in additional paid in capital 
as the series d preferred stock contains a contingent put feature that is outside of our control  it is considered redeemable and we have recorded it in temporary equity 
the initial carrying value of the series d preferred stock was million  after discounts for the portion of the financing proceeds allocated to the warrant liability  the bcf and the financing transaction costs 
since the series d preferred stock was immediately convertible  the million discount related to the bcf was immediately accreted to preferred dividends in  resulting in an increase in the carrying value of the series d preferred stock to million 
the sale of shares of series e preferred stock and series e warrants in our november series e financing triggered an anti dilution adjustment under the terms of the series d preferred stock  resulting in the conversion price of the series d preferred stock being reduced and fixed at per share  and such shares no longer being subject to 
table of contents any anti dilution adjustments 
the anti dilution adjustment to the conversion price of the series d preferred stock resulted in an additional million discount on the purchase price of the series d preferred stock and resulted in an additional bcf 
the million additional bcf was immediately accreted to preferred dividends in november which resulted in the carrying value of the series d preferred stock remaining at million 
the holders of shares of series d preferred stock then outstanding are entitled to require us to purchase such shares of series d preferred stock for million plus any accrued but unpaid dividends upon the occurrence of a fundamental change of the company 
since we have determined that a fundamental change of the company is not currently probable  the remaining discount of million is not accreted to preferred stock dividends in our statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
such amount will only be accreted to preferred dividends in our statements of operations and comprehensive loss at the time that the redemption becomes probable  if ever 
if we had determined that the series d preferred stock was a debt host rather than an equity host  the conversion feature would have been bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative 
if the conversion feature had been accounted for as a derivative it would have been marked to fair value each quarter with the change in fair value being recorded in other income expense in our statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
this would have materially affected our net loss available for common stockholders and loss per share 
series e convertible preferred stock on november   we received net proceeds of million from the sale and issuance of shares of our series e preferred stock and series e warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
we first considered the series e preferred stock under asc and determined that it was not mandatorily redeemable 
we then identified the following three embedded features within the series e preferred stock optional conversion by the holder  optional redemption by the company  and an alternative redemption by the company 
we determined that the series e preferred stock was equity like 
we was assessed the optional conversion by the holder to be clearly and closely related to the preferred stock and thus not subject to bifurcation under asc the optional redemption by us and the alternative redemption by us were both indexed to our own stock and met the criteria for equity classification under asc and thus were not required to be bifurcated 
we issued the series e preferred stock together with series e warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock 
since the series e preferred stock and the series e warrants were classified in stockholders equity  the gross proceeds from the financing were allocated between the series e preferred stock and the series e warrants based on their relative fair values at the time of the november  series e financing 
we computed the fair value of the warrants using the black scholes model and determined it to be million 
we recorded the million prorated value of the warrants as additional paid in capital 
we then considered the series e preferred stock under asc to determine if a bcf existed 
as of the transaction date  we computed a bcf of million using the initial stated conversion rate 
since the conversion feature is immediately exercisable  we accreted the million bcf immediately to preferred dividends new accounting pronouncements we adopted financial accounting standards board  or fasb  asu no 
 fair value measurement topic on a prospective basis effective january  asu no 
updates the existing fair value measurement guidance currently included in the asc to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in united states generally accepted accounting principles  or us gaap  and international financial reporting standards 
asu no 
is generally consistent with the company s previous fair value measurement policies but includes additional disclosure requirements  particularly for assets and liabilities that require the use of level inputs to measure fair value 
the adoption of asu no 
did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
effective january   we adopted asu no 
 comprehensive income  which requires companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous 
table of contents statement or as two consecutive statements 
asu no 
is applied retroactively to all periods presented 
asu no 
eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders deficit equity 
the update does not change the items which must be reported in other comprehensive income  how such items are measured or when they must be reclassified to net income 
the adoption of asu no 
did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
results of operations years ended december   and alliance revenue our alliance revenues are comprised primarily of revenue earned under various collaboration and licensing agreements which include license fees  research and development revenues  including reimbursement of internal and third party expenses  milestones and patent related reimbursements 
the following table is a summary of our alliance revenue earned under our collaboration and licensing agreements year ended december  annual percentage change in millions license fees research and development milestones other total alliance revenue license fees 
license fees primarily include license fee revenue recognized during under our collaborations with merck co 
and merck kgaa  darmstadt  germany  or merck kgaa 
license fee revenue during was comprised of amortization of the upfront license fee payments under these collaborations 
we recognized license fee revenue ratably over the expected period of our continuing involvement in the collaborations  which has generally represented the estimated research period of the agreement 
the following table is a summary of license fees recognized under our two collaborations during collaborator year ended december  in millions merck kgaa merck co 
we received a million upfront payment from merck kgaa in euros in february of which we received million due to foreign currency exchange rates in effect at the time 
we recognized the million upfront payment as revenue over the twenty eight month research term that ended in june we received a million upfront payment from merck co 
in december we recognized the million upfront payment as revenue over the two year initial research term and the two year extension period that ended in december since we completed the research portions of these collaborations during  all of 
table of contents the upfront license fee payments were fully amortized by december consequently  the amount of license fee revenue that we recognized under the merck kgaa and merck co 
collaborations decreased in and we did not recognize any license fee revenue during and research and development revenue 
research and development revenues in consisted of reimbursement of us by merck kgaa of costs incurred by us in connection with clinical trials under our collaboration agreement with merck kgaa 
by march  merck kgaa had assumed sponsorship of these clinical trials of imo and we did not conduct any clinical trials of imo after as a result  we did not incur any such costs or receive any such reimbursements in and and as such did not recognize any research and development revenue in and milestone revenue 
in and  we received no milestone payments 
in  we received million as a result of the initiation by merck kgaa of a phase b clinical trial of imo in treatment of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck  or scchn 
other revenue 
other revenue consisted of reimbursement by licensees of costs associated with patent maintenance 
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in and decreased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in in the following table  research and development expense is set forth in six categories which are discussed beneath the table year ended december  annual percentage change in millions imo external development expense imo external development expense imo external development expense cost of regaining rights to cancer program in imo external development expense other drug development expense basic discovery expense imo external development expenses 
these expenses include external expenses that we have incurred in connection with imo since november  when we commenced clinical development of imo these external expenses include payments to independent contractors and vendors for drug development activities conducted after the initiation of imo clinical development but exclude internal costs such as payroll and overhead expenses 
we incurred approximately million in external development expenses from november through december   including costs associated with our clinical trials  manufacturing and process development activities related to the production of imo  and additional nonclinical toxicology studies 
the increase in imo expenses in  as compared to  was primarily attributable to costs incurred in in connection with the preparation for and conduct of our phase clinical trial of imo in patients with psoriasis that we initiated in april and for which we completed patient activities in december the increases in were partially offset by decreases in costs associated with nonclinical studies  the manufacture of imo drug supply  costs incurred in the periods in preparation for a previously planned phase clinical trial  and data analysis of the completed phase clinical trials of imo 
table of contents the decrease in imo expenses in as compared to was primarily attributable to lower costs in associated with nonclinical safety studies  lower expenses in associated with the manufacture of additional imo drug supplies  and the completion of all patient activities in with respect to our phase clinical trials 
these reductions in expenses for imo relative to expenses were partially offset by costs associated with the preparation for a planned phase clinical trial 
we expect imo expenses in to decrease relative to expenses  due to the completion of patient activities in the phase trial in imo external development expenses 
these expenses include external expenses that we have incurred in connection with imo since october  when we commenced clinical development of imo these external expenses include payments to independent contractors and vendors for drug development activities conducted after the initiation of imo clinical development but exclude internal costs such as payroll and overhead expenses 
since october  we have incurred approximately million in external development expenses through december   including costs associated with our phase clinical trial in healthy subjects that we initiated in  and additional nonclinical studies 
we classified the imo external development expenses incurred prior to october as other drug development expenses 
in the fourth quarter of  we initiated a phase clinical trial of imo in healthy subjects 
the first portion of this phase trial is a rising single dose evaluation of imo administered by subcutaneous injection 
the second portion of this phase trial involved escalating dosages of imo administered once per week for four weeks 
the primary objectives of this phase clinical trial are to evaluate the safety  and pharmacodynamics of imo this trial is being conducted at a single us site 
based on the clinical activity of imo observed in our four week phase clinical trial of imo in patients with psoriasis  we have determined that the next step in our development program is to conduct a phase clinical trial in patients with psoriasis with a treatment period of up to weeks 
based on our evaluation of the comparative profiles of imo and imo  including the engagement of tlr by imo  we have determined to focus our resources on the development of imo and to conduct this trial in patients with psoriasis with imo we plan to conduct this trial at one site in europe 
in march  we submitted to the regulatory authorities in europe the proposed protocol for this trial 
under the proposed protocol  adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis would be randomized into one of four cohorts and receive placebo or imo at a dose level of   or mg kg week for weeks 
we expect that we could initiate this trial as early as the second quarter of we also plan to initiate a phase clinical trial of imo in patients with lupus in the second half of our plans to conduct these phase trials with imo are subject to successful completion of the ongoing phase trial of imo in addition  we intend to consider conducting a proof of concept study of imo in an orphan autoimmune disease indication 
our ability to conduct all or any of the two phase trials and the proof of concept study is subject to our ability to raise additional funding to fund the conduct of these trials and the study 
imo external development expenses 
these expenses include external expenses that we have incurred in connection with imo these external expenses include payments to independent contractors and vendors for drug development activities conducted after the initiation of imo clinical development  but exclude internal costs such as payroll and overhead expenses 
we commenced clinical development of imo in and from through december  we incurred approximately million in external development expenses  including costs associated with our clinical trials  manufacturing  process development activities related to the production of imo  additional nonclinical toxicology studies  and the cost of regaining our rights to imo and follow on compounds for use in the treatment of cancer  excluding cancer vaccines  under the termination agreement discussed below 

table of contents under our collaboration with merck kgaa  merck kgaa was responsible for developing imo for the treatment of cancer excluding vaccines 
merck kgaa refers to imo as emd from december to march  we conducted clinical trials of imo under the collaboration and merck kgaa reimbursed us 
as of march  merck kgaa assumed sponsorship of all ongoing clinical trials of imo for the treatment of cancer and responsibility for all further clinical development of imo in the treatment of cancer 
as a result of merck kgaa s assumption of sponsorship of the trials  we did not incur significant expenses for imo development in and  except for costs associated with the termination agreement discussed below 
on november   we entered into an agreement to terminate our collaboration with merck kgaa and to regain rights for developing tlr agonists for the treatment of cancer 
in connection with the termination agreement  we agreed to reimburse merck kgaa for up to million million using a december  exchange rate of merck kgaa s costs for the third party contract research organization that was coordinating merck kgaa s phase trial of imo in combination with cetuximab  payable in eleven installments commencing on march  including a final payment payable upon merck kgaa s completion of certain specified activities 
as of december   we have paid of the million million using exchange rates in effect at the time that the payments were made of the million 
we also agreed to pay to merck kgaa one time million million using a december  exchange rate milestone payments upon the occurrence of each of the following milestones i partnering of imo with any third party  ii initiation of any phase or phase clinical trial for imo and iii regulatory submission of imo in any country 
we recorded  in research and development expense during  million million using a november  exchange rate in installment payments which represents the cost of regaining our rights to imo and our follow on compounds for use in the treatment of cancer  excluding cancer vaccines 
under the agreement  merck kgaa agreed to continue to conduct the phase trial of imo in combination with cetuximab and other specified related activities and to complete and analyze all clinical trials that merck kgaa had initiated or for which merck kgaa had assumed sponsorship and to finalize clinical trial reports 
as a result  we did not incur significant expenses for imo development during any milestone payments will be recorded at the time that any milestones are achieved 
we and  during the collaboration period  merck kgaa  have conducted clinical trials of imo alone or in combination with other anticancer agents in several cancer indications  including a phase b trial of imo in combination with erlotinib and bevacizumab in patients with advanced nsclc  a phase b clinical trial of imo in combination with cetuximab and the chemotherapy regimen folfiri in patients with advanced colorectal cancer  a randomized phase trial of imo in combination with cetuximab in patients with scchn  and a phase trial of imo monotherapy in patients with rcc 
we are seeking to enter into collaboration with one or more pharmaceutical companies to advance the use of imo in the treatment of cancer 
imo external development expenses 
these expenses include external expenses that we have incurred in connection with imo these external expenses include payments to independent contractors and vendors for drug development activities conducted after the initiation of imo clinical development  but exclude internal costs such as payroll and overhead expenses 
we commenced clinical development of imo in may and from may through december  we incurred approximately million in external development expenses  including costs associated with our clinical trials manufacturing  process development activities related to the production of imo  and additional nonclinical toxicology studies 
the decrease in imo external development expenses in  as compared to  reflects our determination to discontinue further development of imo in the treatment of hcv in the third quarter of imo external development expenses during included costs associated with the conduct of nonclinical toxicology studies  costs associated with the phase clinical trial in null responder hcv patients and the phase clinical trial in treatment naive hcv patients  and costs associated with preparation for a phase 
table of contents clinical trial of imo in treatment na ve hcv patients that we had planned to initiate in the second quarter of imo external development expenses during were related primarily to costs associated with the completion of nonclinical studies during the first half of  costs associated with data analysis of a phase clinical trial in null responder hcv patients  and costs associated with the maintenance of the clinical drug supply 
the decrease in imo expenses in as compared to was attributable to decreases in costs associated with the phase clinical trial in null responder hcv patients that we initiated in september and the phase clinical trial in treatment naive hcv patients that we initiated in october  manufacturing which occurred in but not in  the preparation in for a phase clinical trial of imo in non responder hcv patients that we had planned to conduct  and a decrease in the cost of conducting additional nonclinical safety studies of imo the decrease in was partially offset by costs incurred in the first half of associated with preparation for the phase clinical trial of imo in treatment na ve hcv patients that we had planned to initiate in the second quarter of we expect that imo external development expenses will be significantly lower in future periods 
other drug development expenses 
these expenses include external expenses associated with preclinical development of identified compounds in anticipation of advancing these compounds into clinical development 
in addition  these expenses include internal costs  such as payroll and overhead expenses  associated with preclinical development and products in clinical development 
the external expenses associated with preclinical compounds include payments to contract vendors for manufacturing and the related stability studies  preclinical studies  including animal toxicology and pharmacology studies  and professional fees 
internal expenses associated with products in clinical development include costs associated with our autoimmune disease scientific advisory board 
the increase in other drug development expenses in  as compared to  was primarily due to costs of preclinical studies and manufacturing activities to support the ind for imo  which we submitted to the fda in the third quarter of  and was partially offset by the cost of obtaining from novartis nonclinical and clinical trial data from studies of imo  a tlr agonist  which cost we accrued in  costs associated with nonclinical studies and manufacturing of preclinical research compounds in  and lower employee compensation during the increase in other drug development expenses in  as compared to  was primarily due to increases in the cost of nonclinical studies of preclinical compounds  manufacturing expenses and consulting costs 
these increases reflect costs associated with preclinical studies to support the planned submission of an ind for imo and were partially offset by lower employee expenses in the increase in other drug development expenses during also reflects the cost of obtaining from novartis nonclinical and clinical trial data from studies conducted by our former collaborative partner of imo basic discovery expenses 
these expenses include our internal and external expenses relating to our discovery efforts with respect to our tlr targeted programs  including agonists and antagonists of tlr  tlr  tlr  and tlr  tlr antisense  and gsos 
these expenses reflect payments for laboratory supplies  external research  and professional fees  as well as payroll and overhead expenses

the decrease in basic discovery expenses in  as compared to  was primarily due to decreases in the cost of laboratory supplies and employee expenses 
we do not know if we will be successful in developing any drug candidate from our research and development programs 
at this time  and without knowing the outcome of our ongoing phase clinical trial of imo  and without an established plan for future clinical tests of drug candidates  we cannot reasonably 
table of contents estimate or know the nature  timing  and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of  or the period  if any  in which material net cash inflows may commence from  any drug candidate from our research and development programs 
moreover  the clinical development of any drug candidate from our research and development programs is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the duration and cost of clinical trials  which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of unanticipated events arising during clinical development 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in and decreased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary expense  stock compensation expense  consulting fees and professional legal fees associated with our patent applications and maintenance  our corporate regulatory filing requirements  our corporate legal matters  and our business development initiatives 
the million decrease in general and administration expenses in  as compared to  was primarily due to lower legal costs associated with patent matters and lower employee compensation due to decreases in stock based compensation and the number of employees during these decreases were partially offset by higher corporate legal expenses associated with pursuing financing alternatives  including the financing arrangement we entered into with cowen and company llc  or cowen  in april the million decrease in general and administrative expenses in  as compared to  was primarily due to decreases in stock based compensation  employee cash compensation expenses and consulting fees associated with business and strategic initiatives in the decrease in stock compensation expense during was mainly due to higher recognized expense in associated with the modification of non employee director stock options and lower expense recognized in due to options whose fair value had been fully amortized prior to the end of these decreases in general and administrative expenses were partially offset by increases in legal costs associated with patent matters in decrease in fair value of warrant liability during november we recorded a warrant liability of million reflecting the fair value of the series d warrants issued in our november series d financing 
we determined the series d warrants to be a derivative instrument because they contained a specified anti dilution provision that did not meet the indexed to the company s own stock exemption requirements in asc  derivatives and hedging contracts in an entity s own stock  asc the series d warrants were classified as a liability  recorded at fair value as of the transaction date and were marked to fair value through earnings each quarter 
the fair value of the series d warrants decreased to million at december  primarily due to a decrease in the price of our common stock 
the reduction in the fair value of the series d warrant liability resulted in the recognition of million in non operating income in the fair value of the series d warrant liability decreased from million at december  to million at november  primarily due to decreases in the market price of our common stock and the remaining term of the series d warrants resulting in the recognition of million in non operating income in the sale of shares of series e preferred stock and series e warrants in our november series e financing triggered an anti dilution adjustment under the terms of the series d warrants  resulting in the exercise price of the series d warrants being reduced and fixed at the minimum per share and the series d warrants no longer being subject to any anti dilution adjustments 
once the exercise price of the series d warrants became fixed  the series d warrants then met the exception under asc as they were now indexed to the company s own stock and met certain criteria for equity classification  thus we marked the series d warrants to fair value through earnings as of november   and we then reclassified the remaining million series d warrant liability to stockholders equity at that time

investment income decreased from million in to a negligible amount in due to lower average investment balances and lower interest rates in foreign currency exchange gain loss our foreign currency exchange loss was a negligible amount in compared to a gain of million in and a loss of million in the foreign currency exchange loss during was primarily due to the impact that the weakening value of the us dollar had on our euro denominated accrued liabilities associated with the cost of re gaining the rights to our cancer program and our clinical trial obligations

table of contents funding requirements we have incurred operating losses in all fiscal years except  and  and we had an accumulated deficit of million at december  we have received no revenues from the sale of drugs 
as of january   almost all of our revenues have been from collaboration and license agreements 
we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development  including clinical trials  and we have not completed development of any drugs 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs  we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses  whether or when any of our products will become commercially available or when we will become profitable  if at all 
we do not expect to generate significant additional funds internally until we successfully complete development and obtain marketing approval for products  either alone or in collaboration with third parties  which we expect will take a number of years 
in addition  we have no committed external sources of funds 
we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million at december  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations at least into the third quarter of based on our current operating plan  including the completion of our ongoing phase clinical trial of imo in healthy subjects that we initiated in the fourth quarter of  and preparations for the further advancement of our autoimmune and inflammatory disease program  including preparations for a planned phase clinical trial of imo in patients with psoriasis 
we will need to raise additional funds prior to the end of the second quarter of in order to further advance our autoimmune and inflammatory disease program  commence any clinical trials and operate our business and continue as a going concern 
although we are exploring financing alternatives  financing may not be available to us in the necessary time frame  in the amounts that we need  on terms that are acceptable to us or at all 
if we are unable to raise the necessary funds by late in the second quarter of  we expect that we will terminate our operations and pursue a liquidation of the company through a sale or license of assets or a possible bankruptcy 
if we are able to raise funds by the end of the second quarter of and continue to fund operations  we expect that we will require substantial additional funds to conduct research and development  including preclinical testing and clinical trials of our drug candidates and to fund our operations 
we are seeking and expect to continue to seek additional funding through collaborations  the sale or license of assets or financings of equity or debt securities 
we believe that the key factors that will affect our ability to obtain funding are the results of our clinical and preclinical development programs  including the top line results of the phase trial of imo and the anticipated results of the phase clinical trial of imo  which we initiated in the fourth quarter of  developments relating to our existing strategic collaboration with merck co  our ability to maintain the listing of our common stock on the nasdaq capital market or an alternative national securities exchange  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  competitive and potentially competitive products and technologies and investors receptivity to our drug candidates and the technology underlying them in light of competitive products and technologies  the receptivity of the capital markets to financings by biotechnology companies generally and companies with drug candidates and technologies such as ours specifically  and our ability to enter into new strategic collaborations with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and the success of such collaborations 
in addition  increases in expenses or delays in clinical development may adversely impact our cash position and require additional funds or further cost reductions 
financing may not be available to us when we need it or 
table of contents may not be available to us on favorable or acceptable terms 
we could be required to seek funds through collaborative alliances or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies  drug candidates or drugs that we would otherwise pursue on our own 
in addition  if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our then existing stockholders will experience dilution 
debt financing  if available  may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions  such as incurring additional debt  making capital expenditures or declaring dividends  and are likely to include rights that are senior to the holders of our common stock 
any additional debt financing or equity that we raise may contain terms  such as liquidation and other preferences  or liens or other restrictions on our assets  which are not favorable to us or our stockholders 
an equity financing that involves existing stockholders may cause a concentration of ownership 
the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of existing stockholders
