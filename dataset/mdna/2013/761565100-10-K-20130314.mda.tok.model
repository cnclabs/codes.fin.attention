item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk governmental regulations our oil and natural gas exploration  production  and related operations are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory oversight by federal  state  tribal and local authorities 
we must  for example  obtain drilling permits  post bonds for drilling  operating  and reclamation  and submit various reports 
the following activities are also subject to regulation the location of wells  the method of drilling completion and operating wells  secondary and enhanced oil recovery projects  notice to surface owners and third parties  the surface development  use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled  the plugging and abandoning of wells  temporary storage tank operations  air emissions from flaring  compression and access roads  the impoundment of water  the manner and extent of earth disturbances  air emissions  sour gas management  the disposal of fluids used in connection with operations  and the calculation and distribution of royalty payments and production taxes 
we must also comply with statutes and regulations addressing conservation matters  including the size of drilling and spacing units  or proration units  the number of wells that may be drilled in an area  the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties  the establishment of maximum rates of production 
failure to comply with any of these requirements can result in substantial monetary penalties or lease cancellation 
finally  in the past tribal and local authorities have imposed moratoria or other restrictions on exploration and production activities that must be addressed before those activities can proceed 
moreover most states impose a production  ad valorem or severance tax with respect to production and sale of oil or natural gas within its jurisdiction 
the increasing regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry will most likely increase our cost of doing business and may affect our production rates 
however  these burdens generally do not affect us differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect others in our industry with similar types  quantities and locations of production 
additional proposals or proceedings that affect the oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered by congress  the states  the federal energy regulatory commission ferc  and the courts 
implementation of such could increase the regulatory burden and potential for financial sanctions for non compliance 
although we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  because such rules and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted  we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws 
we may be required to make significant expenditures to comply with governmental laws and regulations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
historically  the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce has been regulated pursuant to the natural gas act of  the natural gas policy act of ngpa  and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the ferc 
in the past  the federal government has regulated the prices at which oil and gas could be sold 
deregulation of wellhead sales in the natural gas industry began with the enactment of the ngpa 
in  the natural gas wellhead decontrol act was enacted  removing both price and non price controls from natural gas sold in first sales no later than january  while sales by producers of natural gas  and all sales of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids currently can be made at uncontrolled market prices  congress could reenact price controls in the future 
the ferc regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions 
its regulations affect the marketing of natural gas produced by us  as well as the revenues that may be received by us for sales of such production 
since the mid s  ferc has issued a series of orders  collectively  order  that have significantly altered the marketing and transportation of natural gas 
order mandated a fundamental restructuring of interstate pipeline sales and transportation service  including the unbundling by interstate pipelines of the sale  transportation  storage and other services such pipelines previously performed 
one of ferc s purposes in issuing order was to increase competition within the natural gas industry 
generally  order has eliminated or substantially reduced the interstate pipelines traditional role as wholesalers of natural gas in favor of providing only storage and transportation service  and has substantially increased competition and volatility in natural gas markets 

table of contents the price we receive from the sale of oil and  ngls will be affected by the cost of transporting products to markets 
effective january   ferc implemented regulations establishing an indexing system for transportation rates for oil pipelines  which  generally  index such rates to inflation  subject to certain conditions and limitations 
we are unable to predict the effect  if any  of these regulations on our intended operations 
the regulations may  however  increase transportation costs or reduce well head prices for oil and ngls 
in august  congress enacted the energy policy act of epact 
among other matters  the epact amends the natural gas act nga  to make it unlawful for any entity  including otherwise non jurisdictional producers such as us to use any deceptive or manipulative device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to regulation by the ferc  in contravention of rules prescribed by the ferc 
on january   the ferc issued rules implementing this provision 
the rules make it unlawful in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of ferc  or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of ferc  for any entity  directly or indirectly  to use or employ any device  scheme or artifice to defraud  to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit any such statement necessary to make the statements not misleading  or to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person 
epact also gives the ferc authority to impose civil penalties for violations of the nga up to  per day per violation 
the new anti manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non jurisdictional sale or gathering  but does apply to activities or otherwise non jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted in connection with gas sales  purchases or transportation subject to ferc jurisdiction which includes the reporting requirements under order nos 
and it therefore reflects a significant expansion of ferc s enforcement authority 
we have not been affected differently than any other producer of natural gas by this act 
environmental matters our operations and properties are subject to extensive and changing federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment 
these laws and regulations require the acquisition of permits or other authorizations before construction  drilling and certain other of our activities  limit or prohibit construction  drilling and other activities on specified lands within wetlands  endangered species habitat  wilderness and other protected areas  and impose substantial liabilities for pollution that may result from our operations  require the installation of pollution control equipment in connection with operations  place restrictions or regulations upon the use or disposal of the material utilized in on our operations  restrict the types  quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment or used in connection with drilling  production and transportation activities  require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations  such as site restoration  pit closure and plugging of abandoned wells  and require the expenditure of significant amounts in connection with worker health and safety 
the permits required for our operations may be subject to revocation  modification and renewal by issuing authorities 
governmental authorities have the power to enforce environmental laws and regulations  and violations may result in fines  injunctions or even criminal penalties 
some states continue to adopt new regulations and permit requirements  which may impede or delay our operations or increase our costs 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations  and  
table of contents except for those matters described in item legal proceedings  have no material commitments for capital expenditures to comply with existing environmental requirements 
nevertheless  the trend in environmental legislation and regulation generally is toward stricter standards  and we expect that this trend will continue 
changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or in interpretations of these laws and regulations could have a significant impact on us  as well as the oil and natural gas industry as a whole 
the following is a summary of the existing laws and regulations that could have a material impact on our business operations 
the resource conservation and recovery act  as amended rcra  and comparable state statutes regulate the generation  transportation  treatment  storage  disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non hazardous wastes 
under the auspices of the federal environmental protection agency  or epa  the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of rcra  sometimes in conjunction with their own  more stringent requirements 
drilling fluids  produced waters and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration and production of crude oil or natural gas are currently regulated under rcra s non hazardous waste provisions 
however  it is possible that certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes now classified as non hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future 
any such change could result in an increase in our costs to manage and dispose of wastes  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the comprehensive environmental  response  compensation  and liability act  as amended cercla  and comparable state statutes impose strict liability on owners and operators of sites and on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at these sites 
this liability may be joint and several and includes liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment  for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies 
in addition  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants into the environment 
we currently own  lease  or operate numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas exploration and production  and produced water disposal operations for many years 
although we believe that we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  hazardous substances  wastes  or hydrocarbons may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties that we own or lease  or on or under other locations  including off site locations  where these substances have been taken for disposal 
in addition  some of our properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances  wastes  or hydrocarbons was not under our control 
these properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to cercla  rcra  and analogous state laws 
under these laws  we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or property contamination  or to perform remedial activities to prevent future contamination 
the federal water pollution control act the clean water act  and analogous state laws  impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants  including spills and leaks of oil and other substances  into waters of the united states 
the epa and delegated states have adopted regulations concerning the discharge of storm water runoff 
these regulations require covered facilities to obtain individual permits or to seek coverage under a general permit 
the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited  except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the epa or an analogous state agency 
the clean water act also prohibits the unpermitted discharge of fill material into waters of the united states  including certain wetlands 
federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative  civil and criminal penalties for non compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the clean water act and analogous state laws and regulations 
our oil and natural gas exploration and production operations generate produced water as a waste material  which is subject to the disposal requirements of the clean water act  the safe drinking water act sdwa  
table of contents or an equivalent state regulatory program 
this produced water is disposed of by re injection into the subsurface through disposal wells  treatment and discharge to the surface or in evaporation ponds 
whichever disposal method is used  produced water must be disposed of in compliance with permits issued by regulatory agencies  and in compliance with applicable environmental regulations 
this water can sometimes be disposed of by discharging it under discharge permits issued pursuant to the clean water act or an equivalent state program 
another common method of produced water disposal is subsurface injection in disposal wells 
such disposal wells are permitted under the underground injection control program  uic  which is a program promulgated under the sdwa 
epa directly administers the uic in some states and in others it is delegated to the states 
to date  we believe that all necessary surface discharge or disposal well permits have been obtained and that the produced water has been discharged into the produced water disposal wells in substantial compliance with such obtained permits and applicable laws and regulations 
the federal clean air act  and comparable state laws  regulates emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements 
in addition  the epa has developed  and continues to develop  stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources 
in april  the epa issued a final rule under the new source performance standards  or nsps  and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants  or neshaps  programs 
the rule establishes nsps for certain wells  storage vessels  pneumatic controllers  compressors  and natural gas processing plants and revises the neshap for glycol dehydration units 
this rule also requires all new hydraulically fractured wells and wells that are refractured to reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds through green completions 
the rule does  however  provide a transition period that ends january   during which operators will have the option of flaring emissions instead of using green completion technologies 
federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative  civil and criminal penalties for non compliance with air permits or other requirements of the clean air act and associated state laws and regulations 
changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently  and any changes that result in more stringent and costly reporting  waste handling  storage  transport  disposal  or cleanup requirements could materially adversely affect our operations and financial position  as well as those of the oil and gas industry in general 
for example  recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases  commonly referred to as greenhouse gases and including carbon dioxide and methane  may be contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere 
in response to such studies  the us congress has from time to time considered climate change related legislation to restrict greenhouse gas emissions 
the ultimate outcome of this legislative initiative remains uncertain 
almost half of the states have passed laws  adopted regulations or undertaken regulatory initiatives to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases  primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs 
although it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when the us congress may act on climate change legislation or how federal legislation may be reconciled with state and regional requirements  any future federal laws or implementing regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions could require us to incur increased operating costs and could adversely affect demand for the oil  natural gas and ngls that we produce 
in  the us supreme court held in massachusetts  et al 
v 
epa that greenhouse gas emissions may be regulated as an air pollutant under the federal clean air act 
on december   the epa officially published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide  methane and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to human health and the environment because emissions of such gases are  according to the epa  contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes 
these findings by the epa allowed the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the federal clean air act 
since  the epa has issued regulations that  among other things  require a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and that impose greenhouse gas emission limitations in clean air act permits for certain stationary sources 
in addition  on september   the epa issued a final rule requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the united states beginning in for emissions occurring in on november  the epa expanded its greenhouse reporting rule to include onshore 
table of contents petroleum and natural gas production  processing  transmission  storage  and distribution facilities 
under these rules  reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from such facilities is required on an annual basis  and the first reports became due in september for emissions occurring in in addition to federal laws and regulations  the various states where we operate have enacted their own environmental laws and regulations 
as an example  in  pennsylvania enacted legislation  known as act  which established more stringent environmental standards 
among other changes  act required disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing  extended the setback requirements for unconventional wells  restricted well site locations in certain areas such as floodplains  established new spill containment requirements  and authorized local governments to adopt impact fees 
although it is not possible at this time to predict whether proposed federal or state legislation or regulations will be adopted as initially written  if at all  or how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business  any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions 
any additional costs or operating restrictions associated with legislation or regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
in addition  these developments could curtail the demand for fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect demand for our products and services  which may in turn adversely affect our future results of operations

table of contents item a 
risk factors in evaluating our company  the factors described below should be considered carefully 
the occurrence of one or more of these events could significantly and adversely affect our business  prospects  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in such a case  you may lose all or part of your investment 
the risks described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently view to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to our company volatility in oil  ngl and natural gas prices may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments 
the prices we receive for our oil  ngl and natural gas production heavily influence our revenue  profitability  access to capital and future rate of growth 
oil and natural gas are commodities  and therefore their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand 
historically  the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile 
these markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future 
the prices we receive for our production  and the levels of our production  depend on numerous factors beyond our control 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following changes in global supply and demand for oil  ngls and natural gas  the condition of the us and global economy  the actions of certain foreign states  the price and quantity of imports of foreign oil and natural gas  political conditions  including embargoes  in or affecting other oil producing activities  the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production activity  the level of global oil and natural gas inventories  production or pricing decisions made by the organization of petroleum exporting countries  weather conditions  availability of limited refining facilities in the illinois basin reducing competition and resulting in lower regional oil prices than in other us oil producing regions  technological advances affecting energy consumption  effect of energy conservation efforts  and the price and availability of alternative fuels 
furthermore  oil and natural gas prices continued to be volatile in for example  the nymex oil prices in ranged from a high of to a low of per bbl and the nymex natural gas prices in ranged from a high of to a low of per mmbtu 
lower oil  ngl and natural gas prices may not only decrease our revenues on a per unit basis  but also may reduce the amount of oil  ngls and natural gas that we can produce economically 
the higher operating costs associated with many of our oil fields will make our profitability more sensitive to oil price declines 
a sustained decline in oil  ngl or natural gas prices may materially and adversely affect our future business  financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures 

table of contents drilling for and producing oil  ngls and natural gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future success will depend on the success of our exploitation  exploration  development and production activities 
our oil  ngl and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control  including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil  ngl or natural gas production 
our decisions to purchase  explore  develop or otherwise exploit prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses  production data and engineering studies  the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations 
any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions may materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 
please see below for a discussion of the uncertainties involved in these processes 
our costs of drilling  completing and operating wells are often uncertain before drilling commences 
overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomical 
further  our future business  financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures could be materially and adversely affected by any factor that may curtail  delay or cancel drilling  including the following delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements  unusual or unexpected geological formations  pressure or irregularities in geological formations  shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel  equipment malfunctions  failures or accidents  unexpected operational events and drilling conditions  pipe or cement failures  casing collapses  lost or damaged oilfield drilling and service tools  loss of drilling fluid circulation  uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas and fluids  fires and natural disasters  environmental hazards  such as natural gas leaks  oil spills  pipeline ruptures  discharges of toxic gases or mishandling of fluids including frac fluids and underground migration issues  adverse weather conditions  reductions in oil and natural gas prices  oil and natural gas property title problems  and market limitations for oil and natural gas 
if any of these factors were to occur with respect to a particular field  we could lose all or a part of our investment in the field  or we could fail to realize the expected benefits from the field  either of which could materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability 
prospects that we decide to drill may not yield oil  ngls or natural gas in commercially viable quantities 
our prospects are in various stages of evaluation 
there is no way to predict with certainty in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular prospect will yield oil  ngls or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable  particularly in light of the current economic environment 
the use of seismic data and other technologies  and the study of producing fields in the same area  will not enable us to know conclusively before drilling whether oil  ngls or natural gas will be present or  if 
table of contents present  whether oil  ngls or natural gas will be present in commercially viable quantities 
moreover  the analogies we draw from available data from other wells  more fully explored prospects or producing fields may not be applicable to our drilling prospects 
our estimated proved reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate 
any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions may materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 
estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are inherently imprecise 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex 
it requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions  including assumptions relating to economic factors 
any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves 
to prepare our proved reserve estimates  we must project production rates and the timing of development expenditures 
we must also analyze available geological  geophysical  production and engineering data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this data can vary 
the process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil  ngl and natural gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
actual future production  oil  ngl and natural gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves most likely will vary from our estimates 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this report 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of estimated proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing oil  ngl and natural gas prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the present value of future net cash flows from out estimated proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated oil  ngl and natural gas reserves 
we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our estimated proved reserves on prices and costs in effect on the day of estimate 
however  actual future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties also will be affected by factors such as actual prices we receive for oil and natural gas  actual cost of development and production expenditures  the amount and timing of actual production  supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
the timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from estimated proved reserves  and thus their actual present value 
in addition  the discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general 
our development and exploration operations require substantial capital  and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all  which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves 
the oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive 
we make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the exploration for  and development  production and acquisition of  oil and natural gas reserves 
for  we have budgeted million for capital expenditures for 
table of contents development and exploration activities in the appalachian and illinois basins 
to date  we have financed capital expenditures primarily with proceeds from bank borrowings  cash generated by operations  public stock offerings  sales of non core assets and joint venture agreements 
we intend to finance our future capital expenditures with proceeds from bank borrowings  the sale of debt or equity securities  asset sales  cash flow from operations and current and new financing arrangements  such as joint ventures  however  our financing needs may require us to alter or increase our capitalization substantially through the issuance of debt or equity securities 
the issuance of additional equity securities could have a dilutive effect on the value of our common stock 
additional borrowings under our credit facility or the issuance of additional debt securities will require that a greater portion of our cash flow from operations be used for the payment of interest and principal on our debt  thereby reducing our ability to use cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
in addition  our credit facility imposes certain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness other than indebtedness under our credit facility 
if we desire to issue additional debt securities other than as expressly permitted under our credit facility  we will be required to seek the consent of the lenders in accordance with the requirements of the credit facility  which consent may be withheld by the lenders at their discretion 
if we incur certain additional indebtedness  our borrowing base under our credit facility may be reduced 
also  our revolving credit contains covenants that restrict our ability to  among other things  materially change our business  approve and distribute dividends  enter into transactions with affiliates  create or acquire additional subsidiaries  incur indebtedness  sell assets  make loans to others  make investments  enter into mergers  incur liens  and enter into agreements regarding swap and other derivative transactions 
our cash flow from operations and access to capital is subject to a number of variables  including our estimated proved reserves  the level of oil and natural gas we are able to produce from existing wells  our ability to extract ngls from the natural gas we produce  the prices at which oil  ngls and natural gas are sold  and our ability to acquire  locate and produce new reserves 
if our revenues decrease as a result of lower oil  ngl and natural gas prices  operating difficulties  declines in reserves or for any other reason  we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels 
we may need to seek additional financing in the future 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us  or at all 
the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to exploration and development of our prospects  which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves 
we have substantial indebtedness and may incur substantially more debt  which could exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness 
we had approximately million of outstanding indebtedness at december  we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future  including under our revolving credit facility and our second lien credit facility 
at december   our million revolving credit facility had a borrowing base of million for secured borrowings  subject to periodic borrowing base redeterminations 
as a result of our indebtedness  we will need to use a portion of our cash flow to pay interest  which will reduce the amount we will have available to fund our operations and other business activities and could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate 
our indebtedness under our senior credit facility is at a variable interest rate  and so a rise in interest rates will 
table of contents generate greater interest expense to the extent we do not have applicable interest rate fluctuation hedges 
the amount of our debt may also cause us to be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business 
we may incur substantially more debt in the future 
the indenture governing our senior notes contains restrictions on our incurrence of additional indebtedness 
these restrictions  however  are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions  and under certain circumstances  we could incur substantial additional indebtedness in compliance with these restrictions 
moreover  these restrictions do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under the indenture 
our ability to meet our debt obligations and other expenses will depend on our future performance  which will be affected by financial  business  economic  regulatory and other factors  many of which we are unable to control 
if our cash flow is not sufficient to service our debt  we may be required to refinance debt  sell assets or sell additional equity on terms that we may not find attractive if it may be done at all 
further  our failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants relating to our indebtedness could result in a default under that indebtedness  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our revolving credit facility contains  and the indenture governing our senior notes contain  operating and financial restrictions that may restrict our business and financing activities 
our revolving credit facility contains  the indenture governing our senior notes contain  and any future indebtedness we incur may contain  a number of restrictive covenants that will impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us  including restrictions on our ability to  among other things sell assets  including equity interests in our subsidiaries  pay distributions on  redeem or repurchase our common stock or redeem or repurchase our subordinated debt  make investments  incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock  create or incur certain liens  make certain acquisitions and investments  redeem or prepay other debt  enter into agreements that restrict distributions or other payments from our restricted subsidiaries to us  consolidate  merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets  and engage in transactions with affiliates 
as a result of these covenants  we will be limited in the manner in which we conduct our business  and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs 
our ability to comply with some of the covenants and restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes may be affected by events beyond our control 
if market or other economic conditions deteriorate  our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired 
a failure to comply with the covenants  ratios or tests in our revolving credit facility  the indenture governing our senior notes or any future indebtedness could result in an event of default under our revolving credit facility  the indenture governing our senior notes or our future indebtedness  which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if an event of default under our revolving credit facility occurs and remains uncured  the lenders thereunder would not be required to lend any additional amounts to us  
table of contents could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding  together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees  to be due and payable  may have the ability to require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings  or may prevent us from making debt service payments under our other agreements 
a payment default or an acceleration under our revolving credit facility could result in an event of default and an acceleration under the indenture for our senior notes 
if the indebtedness under the notes were to be accelerated  there can be no assurance that we would have  or be able to obtain  sufficient funds to repay such indebtedness in full 
in addition  our obligations under our revolving credit facility are collateralized by perfected first priority liens and security interests on substantially all of our assets and if we are unable to repay our indebtedness under the revolving credit facility  the lenders could seek to foreclose on our assets 
the development of our proved undeveloped reserves in our areas of operation may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate 
therefore  our undeveloped reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced 
approximately of our total estimated proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped as of december  recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling 
our reserve data assumes that we can and will make these expenditures and conduct these operations successfully 
these assumptions  however  may not prove correct 
we estimate that approximately million in capital expenditures will be required over the next five years to develop our total proved undeveloped reserves 
development of these reserves may take longer and require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate 
delays in the development of our reserves or increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves will reduce the pv of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and future net revenues estimated for such reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomic 
in addition  delays in the development of reserves could cause us to have to reclassify our estimated proved reserves as unproved reserves 
any such writeoffs of our reserves could reduce our ability to borrow money and could reduce the value of our securities 
our identified drilling locations are scheduled to be drilled over several years  making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling our management has identified and scheduled drilling locations as an estimate of our future multi year drilling activities on our existing acreage 
all of our drilling locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy 
our ability to drill and develop these locations is subject to a number of uncertainties  including the availability of capital  seasonal conditions  regulatory approvals  availability of drilling services and equipment  lease expirations  gathering system  marketing and pipeline transportation constraints  oil and natural gas prices  drilling and production costs  drilling results and other factors 
because of these uncertainties  we do not know if the numerous potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations 
pursuant to sec rules and guidance  subject to limited exceptions  proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking 
the sec rules and guidance may limit our potential to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program 
unless we replace our oil  ngl and natural gas reserves  our reserves and production will decline  which would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
producing oil  ngls and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending on reservoir characteristics and other factors 
our future oil  ngl and natural gas reserves and production  and therefore our cash flow and income  are highly dependent on our success in efficiently 
table of contents developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves 
we may not be able to develop  find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs  which would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling operations or are unable to dispose of the water we use at a reasonable cost and within applicable environmental rules  our ability to produce gas commercially and in commercial quantities could be impaired 
we use between four and six million gallons of water per well in our well completion operations in the appalachian basin 
our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water  or dispose of water after drilling  could adversely impact our operations 
moreover  the adoption and implementation of new environmental regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or the imposition of new requirements pertaining to the management and disposal of wastes generated by our operations  including  but not limited to  produced water  drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration  development or production of natural gas 
furthermore  new environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal  storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may also increase operating costs and cause delays  interruptions or termination of operations  the extent of which cannot be predicted  all of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies  personnel and drilling and completion services could adversely affect our ability to execute on a timely basis our exploration and development plans within our budget 
we may  from time to time  encounter difficulty in obtaining  or an increase in the cost of securing  drilling rigs  equipment  services and supplies 
in addition  larger producers may be more likely to secure access to such equipment and services by offering more lucrative terms 
if we are unable to acquire access to such resources  or can obtain access only at higher prices  our ability to convert our reserves into cash flow could be delayed and the cost of producing those reserves could increase significantly  which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
federal  state and local regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional restrictions or delays 
hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and or oil from dense subsurface rock formations 
the hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water  sand  and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production 
we commonly use hydraulic fracturing as part of our operations 
increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing may adversely impact our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the federal safe drinking water act sdwa regulates the underground injection of substances through the underground injection control program uic 
the hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions  however  the environmental protection agency epa has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel under the sdwa s uic program 
on may   the epa issued draft guidance for sdwa uic permits issued to oil and natural gas exploration and production operators injecting diesel fuels during the hydraulic fracturing process 
in addition  legislation has been introduced in prior sessions of congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process 
also  many state governments have adopted  and other states are considering adopting  regulations that could impose more stringent permitting  public disclosure  well construction  and operational requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations or otherwise seek to temporarily or permanently ban fracturing activities 
in addition to state laws  local land use restrictions  such as city ordinances  zoning laws  and traffic regulations may restrict or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular 
we believe that we follow 
table of contents applicable standard industry practices and legal requirements for groundwater protection in our hydraulic fracturing activities 
nonetheless  if new or more stringent federal  state  or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate  we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements  experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration  development  or production activities  and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells 
in addition  certain governmental reviews are either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices 
the epa has commenced a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater 
in december the epa issued an update stating that draft results of the study would be available for peer review in in the interim  however  the epa has utilized existing statutory authority under the sdwa  the clean water act cwa  comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla  and the clean air act caa to investigate  order actions  and potentially pursue penalties against some oil and natural gas producers where epa believes their activities may have impacted the air or groundwater 
moreover  the epa is developing effluent limitations for the treatment and discharge of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities and plans to propose these standards by on april   president obama issued an executive order creating a task force to coordinate federal oversight over domestic natural gas production and hydraulic fracturing 
other governmental agencies  including the us department of energy and the us department of the interior  have evaluated or are evaluating various aspects of hydraulic fracturing 
these ongoing or proposed studies  depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained  could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa or other regulatory mechanisms 
to our knowledge  there have been no citations  suits  or contamination of potable drinking water arising from our fracturing operations 
we do not have insurance policies in effect that are intended to provide coverage for losses solely related to hydraulic fracturing operations  however  we believe our general liability and excess liability insurance policies would cover third party claims related to hydraulic fracturing operations and associated legal expenses in accordance with  and subject to  the terms of such policies 
if our access to markets is restricted  it could negatively impact our production  our income and ultimately our ability to retain our leases 
our ability to sell our oil  ngls  and natural gas and or receive market prices for our oil  ngls and natural gas may be adversely affected by pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints 
market conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory oil  ngl and natural gas transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil  ngl and natural gas markets or delay our production 
the availability of a ready market for our oil  ngl and natural gas production depends on a number of factors  including the demand for and supply of oil  ngls and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities 
our ability to market our production depends in substantial part on the availability and capacity of gathering systems  pipelines and processing facilities owned and operated by third parties 
our failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business 
our productive properties may be located in areas with limited or no access to pipelines  thereby necessitating delivery by other means  such as trucking  or requiring compression facilities 
such restrictions on our ability to sell our oil  ngls or natural gas may have several adverse effects  including higher transportation costs  fewer potential purchasers thereby potentially resulting in a lower selling price or  in the event we were unable to market and sustain production from a particular lease for an extended time  possibly causing us to lose a lease due to lack of production 
if drilling in the marcellus shale and other areas of the appalachian basin continues to be successful  the amount of natural gas being produced by us and others could exceed the capacity of the various gathering and intrastate or interstate transportation pipelines currently available in these areas 
if this occurs  it will be necessary for new pipelines and gathering systems to be built 
because of the current economic climate  certain pipeline projects that are planned for these areas may not occur 
in addition  capital constraints could limit our 
table of contents ability to build intrastate gathering systems necessary to transport our gas to interstate pipelines 
in such event  we might have to shut in our wells awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity and or sell natural gas production at significantly lower prices than those quoted on nymex or than we currently project  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
a portion of our natural gas  ngl and oil production in any region may be interrupted  or shut in  from time to time for numerous reasons  including as a result of weather conditions  accidents  loss of pipeline or gathering system access  field labor issues or strikes  or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions 
if a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time  it could temporarily adversely affect our cash flow 
enhanced oil recovery eor techniques that we may use  such as our alkali surfactant polymer flooding in the lawrence field  involve more risk than traditional waterflooding 
an eor technique such as alkali surfactant polymer asp chemical injection involves significant capital investment and an extended period of time  generally two years or longer  from the initial phase of a pilot program until increased production occurs 
the results of any successful pilot program may not be indicative of actual results achieved in a broader eor project in the same field or area 
generally  surfactant polymer  including asp  injection is regarded as involving more risk than traditional waterflood operations 
our ability to achieve commercial production and recognize estimated proved reserves from our eor projects is greatly contingent upon many inherent uncertainties associated with eor technology  including asp technology  geological uncertainties  chemical and equipment availability  rig availability and many other factors 
we cannot control activities on properties that we do not operate and are unable to control their proper operation and profitability 
we do not operate all of the properties in which we own an interest 
as a result  we have limited ability to exercise influence over  and control the risks associated with  the operations of these properties 
the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations  an operator s breach of the applicable agreements or an operator s failure to act in ways that are in our best interests could reduce our production and revenues 
the success and timing of our drilling and development activities on properties operated by others therefore depend upon a number of factors outside of our control  including the operator s nature and timing of drilling and operational activities  timing and amount of capital expenditures  expertise and financial resources  the approval of other participants in drilling wells  and selection of suitable technology 
all of the value of our production and reserves is concentrated in the appalachian basin and illinois basin 
because of this concentration  any production problems or changes in assumptions affecting our proved reserve estimates related to these areas could have a material adverse impact to our business 
for the year ended december   approximately of our net production came from the appalachian basin and came from the illinois basin 
as of december   approximately of our estimated proved reserves were located in the fields that comprise the appalachian basin and of our estimated proved reserves were located in fields that comprise the illinois basin 
if mechanical problems  weather conditions or other events were to curtail a substantial portion of the production in one or both of these 
table of contents regions  our cash flow would be adversely affected 
if ultimate production associated with these properties is less than our estimated reserves  or changes in pricing  cost or recovery assumptions in the area results in a downward revision of any estimated reserves in these properties  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
competition in the oil  ngl and natural gas industry is intense  which may adversely affect our ability to compete 
we operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties  marketing oil  ngls and natural gas and securing trained personnel 
many of our competitors possess and employ financial  technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours  which can be particularly important in the areas in which we operate 
those companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit 
our ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves  developing reserves  marketing hydrocarbons  attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital 
we may be required to take additional write downs of the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties  potentially triggering earlier than anticipated repayments of any outstanding debt obligations and negatively impacting the trading value of our securities 
there is a risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and gas properties 
we account for our natural gas and crude oil exploration and development activities using the successful efforts method of accounting 
under this method  costs of productive exploratory wells  developmental dry holes and productive wells and undeveloped leases are capitalized 
oil and gas lease acquisition costs are also capitalized 
exploration costs  including personnel costs  certain geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals for oil and gas leases are charged to expense as incurred 
exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized  but charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to have found reserves in commercial quantities 
the capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties may not exceed the estimated future net cash flows from our properties 
if capitalized costs exceed future cash flows  we write down the costs of the properties to our estimate of fair market value 
any such charge will not affect our cash flow from operating activities  but will reduce our earnings and may have a material adverse effect on our ability to pay interest on our senior notes 
the application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires managerial judgment to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory  which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of the costs incurred 
the results from a drilling operation can take considerable time to analyze and the determination that commercial reserves have been discovered requires both judgment and industry experience 
wells may be completed that are assumed to be productive but may actually deliver oil and gas in quantities insufficient to be economic  which may result in the abandonment of the wells at a later date 
wells are drilled that have targeted geologic structures that are both developmental and exploratory in nature  and an allocation of costs is required to properly account for the results 
the evaluation of oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs requires judgment to estimate the fair value of these costs with reference to drilling activity in a given area 
we review our oil and gas properties for impairment annually or whenever events and circumstances indicate a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value 
once incurred  a write down of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date even if gas or oil prices increase 
given the complexities associated with oil and gas reserve estimates and the history of price volatility in the oil and gas markets  events may arise that would require us to record an impairment of the book values associated with oil and gas properties 

table of contents additional write downs could occur if oil and gas prices decline or if we have substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves  increases in our estimates of development costs or deterioration in our drilling results 
because our properties currently serve  and will likely continue to serve  as collateral for advances under our existing and future credit facilities  a write down in the carrying values of our properties could require us to repay debt earlier than we would otherwise be required 
we may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our oil  ngl and natural gas operations  and we may not have enough insurance to cover all of the risks that we face 
we maintain insurance coverage against some  but not all  potential losses to protect against the risks we face 
we do not carry business interruption insurance 
we may elect not to carry insurance if our management believes that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented 
in addition  it is not possible to insure fully against pollution and environmental risks 
losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil  ngls and natural gas  including the possibility of environmental hazards  such as uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas  brine  well fluids  toxic gas or other pollution into the environment  including groundwater and shoreline contamination and soil contamination  abnormally pressured formations  mechanical difficulties  such as stuck oil field drilling and service tools and casing collapses  fires and explosions  personal injuries and death  and natural disasters 
any of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to us 
if a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance  then that accident or other event could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we are subject to complex laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost  manner or feasibility of doing business 
the exploration  development  production and sale of oil  ngls and natural gas are subject to extensive federal  state  and local laws and regulations 
such regulation includes requirements for permits to drill and to conduct other operations and for provision of financial assurances such as bonds covering drilling and well operations 
other activities subject to regulation are the location and spacing of wells  the unitization and pooling of properties  the method of drilling and completing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled  the plugging and abandoning of wells  the disposal of fluids used or other wastes generated in connection with our drilling operations  the marketing  transportation and reporting of production  and the valuation and payment of royalties 

table of contents under these laws  we could be subject to claims for personal injury or property damages  including natural resource damages  which may result from the impacts of our operations 
failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
moreover  these laws could change in ways that substantially increase our costs of compliance 
any such liabilities  penalties  suspensions  terminations or regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we must obtain governmental permits and approvals for our drilling and midstream operations  which can be a costly and time consuming process  which may result in delays and restrictions on our operations 
regulatory authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance 
requirements imposed by these authorities may be costly and time consuming and may result in delays in the commencement or continuation of our exploration or production operations 
for example  we are often required to prepare and present to federal  state or local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that proposed exploration for or production of natural gas or oil may have on the environment 
further  the public may comment on and otherwise engage in the permitting process  including through intervention in the courts 
accordingly  the permits we need may not be issued  or if issued  may not be issued in a timely fashion  or may involve requirements that restrict our ability to conduct our operations or to do so profitably 
our operations expose us to substantial costs and liabilities with respect to environmental matters 
our oil  ngl and natural gas operations are subject to stringent federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the release of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences  restrict the types  quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment in connection with our drilling and production activities  limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness  wetlands and other protected areas  including the habitat of threatened and endangered species  and impose substantial liabilities for pollution that may result from our operations 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations or the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting certain activities 
under existing environmental laws and regulations  we could be held strictly liable for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether the release resulted from our operations  or whether our operations were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed 
changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently  and any changes that result in more stringent or costly waste handling  storage  transport  disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to maintain compliance  and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our competitive position  financial condition and results of operations 
climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil  ngls and natural gas that we produce 
in december  the epa published its findings that emissions of greenhouse gases ghgs present a danger to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are  according to the epa  contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic conditions 
based on these findings  in the epa adopted two sets of regulations that restrict emissions of ghgs under existing provisions of the federal clean air act  including one that requires a reduction in emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles and another that requires certain construction and operating permit reviews for ghg emissions from certain large stationary sources 
the stationary source final rule addresses the permitting of ghg emissions from stationary sources under the clean air act prevention of significant deterioration  or psd  construction and title v operating permit programs  pursuant to which these permit programs have been tailored to apply to certain stationary sources of ghg emissions in a multi step process  with the largest sources first subject to permitting 

table of contents in addition  in november  the epa issued a final rule requiring companies to report certain greenhouse gas emissions from oil and natural gas facilities 
on july   the epa amended the oil and natural gas facility greenhouse gas reporting rule to require reporting 
under this rule  initial reports became due in september we believe that we are in substantial compliance with these reporting obligations 
the epa has indicated that it will use ghg reporting data in considering whether to initiate further rulemaking to establish ghg emissions limits 
further  in april the epa issued final new source performance standards and national emission standards for air pollutants 
this rule requires all new hydraulically fractured wells to reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds through green completions 
the rule is designed to reduce ghg emissions during well completions 
the rule does  however  provide a transition period that ends january   during which operators will have the option of flaring emissions instead of using green completion technologies 
also  congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs  and almost one half of the states already have taken legal measures to reduce emissions of ghgs  primarily through the planned development of ghg emission inventories and or regional ghg cap and trade programs 
the adoption of any legislation or regulations that requires reporting of ghgs or otherwise restricts emissions of ghgs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur significant added costs to reduce emissions of ghgs or could adversely affect demand for the oil  natural gas and ngls we produce 
finally  some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earth s atmosphere may produce climate change that could have significant physical effect  such as increased frequency and severity of storms  droughts  and floods and other climatic events  if such effects were to occur  they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations 
the adoption of derivatives legislation by congress and related regulations could have an adverse impact on our ability to use derivative instruments  particularly swaps  to reduce the effect of commodity price  interest rate and other risks associated with our business 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  or the act  was enacted in the act provides for new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions  including certain oil and gas hedging transactions involving swaps 
in particular  the act includes a requirement that certain hedging transactions involving swaps be cleared and exchange traded and a requirement to post cash collateral for non cleared swap transactions  although  at this time  it is unclear which transactions will ultimately be required to be cleared and exchange traded or which counterparties will be required to post cash collateral with respect to non cleared swap transactions 
the act provides for a potential exception from the clearing and exchange trading requirement for hedging transactions by commercial end users  a category of non financial entities in which we may be included 
while the commodity futures trading commission  or cftc  and other federal agencies have adopted  and continue to adopt  numerous regulations pursuant to the act  many of the key concepts and defined terms under the act have not yet been delineated by rules and regulations to be adopted by the cftc and other applicable regulatory agencies 
as a consequence  it is difficult to predict the aggregate effect the act and the regulations promulgated thereunder may have on our hedging activities 
whether we are required to submit our swap transactions for clearing or post cash collateral with respect to such transaction will depend on the final rules and definitions adopted by the cftc 
if we are subject to such requirements  significant liquidity issues could result by reducing our ability to use cash posted as collateral for investment or other corporate purposes 
a requirement to post cash collateral could also limit our ability to execute strategic hedges  which would result in increased commodity price uncertainty and volatility in our future cash flows 
the act and related regulations will also require us to comply with certain futures and swaps position limits and new recordkeeping and reporting requirements  and may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to a separate entity  which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty 
the act and related regulations could also materially alter the terms of derivative contracts  reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter  reduce our ability to monetize or restructure existing derivative contracts  and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties 
if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the legislation and regulations  our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable 

table of contents enactment of a pennsylvania severance tax and impact fees on natural gas could adversely impact our results of existing operations and the economic viability of exploiting new gas drilling and production opportunities in pennsylvania 
while pennsylvania has historically not imposed a severance tax relating to the extraction of natural gas  with a focus on its budget deficit and the increasing exploration of the marcellus shale  various legislation has been proposed since in february  pennsylvania implemented an impact fee 
this new law imposed an impact fee on all unconventional wells drilled in the commonwealth of pennsylvania in counties that elected to impose the fee 
the fee  which changes from year to year  is based on the average annual price of natural gas as determined by the nymex price  as reported by the wall street journal for the last trading day of each calendar month 
based upon natural gas prices for  operators will pay  per unconventional horizontal well 
unconventional vertical wells will pay a fee equal to twenty percent of the horizontal well fee and the impact fee will not apply to any unconventional vertical well that produces less than mcf per day 
the payment structure for the impact fee makes the fee due the year after an unconventional well is spudded and the fee will continue for years for a horizontal well and years for a vertical well 
future economic conditions in the us and global markets may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition that we currently cannot predict 
the us and other world economies continue to experience the after effects of a global recession and credit market crisis 
more volatility may occur before a sustainable growth rate is achieved either domestically or globally 
even if such growth rate is achieved  such a rate may be lower than the us and international economies have experienced in the past 
global economic growth drives demand for energy from all sources  including for oil and natural gas 
a lower future economic growth rate will result in decreased demand for our crude oil  ngl and natural gas production as well as lower commodity prices  which will reduce our cash flows from operations and our profitability 
our results of operations and cash flow may be adversely affected by risks associated with our oil and gas financial derivative activities  and our oil and gas financial derivative activities may limit potential gains 
we have entered into  and we expect to enter into in the future  oil and gas financial derivative arrangements corresponding to a significant portion of our oil and natural gas production 
many derivative instruments that we employ require us to make cash payments to the extent the applicable index exceeds a predetermined price  thereby limiting our ability to realize the benefit of increases in oil and natural gas prices 
we received net payments of million in relation to our commodity derivative instruments for the year ended december  if our actual production and sales for any period are less than the corresponding volume of derivative contracts for that period including reductions in production due to operational delays  or if we are unable to perform our activities as planned  we might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of our derivative obligations without the benefit of the cash flow from our sale of the underlying physical commodity  resulting in a substantial diminution of our liquidity 
in addition  our oil and gas financial derivative activities can result in substantial losses 
such losses could occur under various circumstances  including any circumstance in which a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the applicable derivative arrangement  the arrangement is imperfect or our derivative policies and procedures are not followed or do not work as planned 
under the terms of our revolving credit facility  the percentage of our total production volumes with respect to which we will be allowed to enter into derivative contracts is limited  and we therefore retain the risk of a price decrease for our remaining production volume 

table of contents the standardized measure and pv of our estimated reserves are not accurate estimates of the current fair value of our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves 
standardized measure is a reporting convention that provides a common basis for comparing oil and natural gas companies subject to the rules and regulations of the sec 
our non gaap financial measure  pv  is a similar reporting convention that we have disclosed in this report 
both measures require the use of operating and development costs prevailing as of the date of computation 
consequently  they will not reflect the prices ordinarily received or that will be received for oil and natural gas production because of varying market conditions  nor may it reflect the actual costs that will be required to produce or develop the oil and natural gas properties 
accordingly  estimates included herein of future net cash flows may be materially different from the future net cash flows that are ultimately received 
in addition  the percent discount factor  which is required by the rules and regulations of the sec to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with our company or the oil and natural gas industry in general 
therefore  standardized measure or pv included in this report should not be construed as accurate estimates of the current fair value of our proved reserves 
based on december  reserve estimates  we project that a decline in the price per barrel of oil  price per barrel of ngls and the price per mcf of gas from average prices would reduce our gross revenues  before the effects of derivatives  for the year ending december  by approximately million 
we depend on a relatively small number of purchasers for a substantial portion of our revenue 
the inability of one or more of our purchasers to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results 
we derive a significant amount of our revenue from sales to a relatively small number of purchasers 
approximately of our commodity sales from continuing operations as of december  were due from five customers  with the largest single customer accounting for 
if we were unable to continue to sell our oil  ngls  or natural gas to these key customers  or to offset any reduction in sales to these customers by additional sales to our other customers  it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
these companies may not provide the same level of our revenue in the future for a variety of reasons  including their lack of funding  a strategic shift on their part in moving to different geographic areas in which we do not operate or our failure to meet their performance criteria 
the loss of all or a significant part of this revenue would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our business may suffer if we lose key personnel 
our operations depend on the continuing efforts of our executive officers and senior management 
our business or prospects could be adversely affected if any of these persons does not continue in their management role with us and we are unable to attract and retain qualified replacements 
additionally  we do not carry key person insurance for any of our executive officers or senior management 
our future acquisitions may yield revenue or production that varies significantly from our projections 
in pursuing potential acquisition of oil and natural gas properties  we will assess the potential recoverable reserves  future natural gas and oil prices  operating costs  potential liabilities and other factors relating to the properties 
our assessments are necessarily inexact  and their accuracy is inherently uncertain 
our review of a subject property in connection with our acquisition assessment will not reveal all existing or potential problems or permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the property to assess fully its deficiencies and capabilities 
we may not inspect every well  and we may not be able to observe structural and environmental problems even when we do inspect a well 
if problems are identified  the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of those problems 
any acquisition of property interests may not be economically successful  and unsuccessful acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and future results of operations 

table of contents certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation 
congress has recently considered  is considering  and may continue to consider  legislation that  if adopted in its proposed or similar form  would deprive some companies involved in oil and natural gas exploration and production activities of certain us federal income tax incentives and deductions currently available to such companies 
these changes include  but are not limited to  i the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties  ii the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs  iii the elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities  and iv an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures 
it is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and  if enacted  how soon any such changes could become effective and whether such changes may apply retroactively 
although we are unable to predict whether any of these or other proposals will ultimately be enacted  the passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any other similar changes in us federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available to us  and any such change could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 
new technologies may cause our current exploration and drilling methods to become obsolete 
the oil and gas industry is subject to rapid and significant advancements in technology  including the introduction of new products and services using new technologies 
as competitors use or develop new technologies  we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage  and competitive pressures may force us to implement new technologies at a substantial cost 
in addition  competitors may have greater financial  technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can 
one or more of the technologies that we currently use or that we may implement in the future may become obsolete 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to implement technologies on a timely basis or at a cost that is acceptable to us 
if we are unable to maintain technological advancements consistent with industry standards  our operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
the outcome of litigation in which we have been named as a defendant is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
we are defendants in a number of litigation matters and are subject to various other claims  demands and investigations 
these matters may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations 
no assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us 
an adverse resolution or outcome of any of these lawsuits  claims  demands or investigations could have a negative impact on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
risks related to our common stock we may issue additional common stock in the future  which would dilute our existing stockholders 
in the future we may issue our previously authorized and unissued securities  including shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock  resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our stockholders 
we are authorized under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to issue  shares of common stock and  shares of preferred stock with such designations  preferences  and rights as may be determined by our board of directors 
as of march   there were  shares of our common stock issued and outstanding and there were no shares of our preferred stock issued and outstanding 
we have an effective shelf registration statement from which additional shares of our common stock and other securities can be issued 
we may also issue additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock in connection with future public offerings  the hiring of personnel

illinois basin in the illinois basin  we own an interest in  wells  which includes disposal and injection wells 
we have approximately   net acres owned and under lease 
total estimated proved reserves in the illinois basin increased approximately bcfe  or  to approximately bcfe at december  when compared to year end  which was primarily due to the addition of bcfe of estimated proved developed non producing reserves from our asp project in the delta unit as a result of the success of our pilot operations in the area 
annual production increased from capital expenditures in for drilling  facility improvements and acreage acquisitions in the region were approximately million  which funded the drilling of gross net wells 
these expenditures also covered work performed in the basin designed to optimize our secondary waterflood operations whereby we stabilized declining production 
capital expenditures for drilling and facilities development for the lawrence field asp flood project totaled approximately million 
lawrence field asp flood project we currently own and operate square miles approximately  net acres of the lawrence field 
the cypress mississippian and the bridgeport pennsylvanian sandstones are the major producing horizons in the field 
to date  approximately of the estimated one billion barrels of the original oil in place has been produced 
we are continuing the implementation of an asp flood project in the cypress and bridgeport sandstone reservoirs of our lawrence field acreage 
the lawrence field asp flood project is considered an eor project  which refers to recovery of oil that is not producible by primary or secondary recovery methods 
in the s  s and s  a number of eor projects using surfactant polymer floods were implemented in several fields in the illinois basin by marathon  texaco and exxon in an attempt to recover a portion of the large percentage of the original oil in place that was being bypassed by the secondary recovery waterflood 
these test projects reportedly were able to recover incremental oil reserves of to of the original oil in place 
while we believe the results of these projects are pertinent  there can be no assurance that our lawrence field asp flood project  which uses technology that was not developed at the time of the prior eor projects  will achieve similar results 
more modern asp technology  which uses mechanisms to mobilize bypassed residual oil similar to these previous surfactant polymer floods but at significantly lower costs  has been applied by other companies in several fields around the world resulting in significant incremental recoveries of the original oil in place 
chemicals used in the lawrence field asp flood project include alkali  surfactants and polymer 
the alkali and surfactant combination acts like a soap and washes residual oil from the reservoir mainly by reducing interfacial tension between the oil and the water 
the polymer is added to improve sweep displacement efficiency by pushing the washed oil through the rock pores of the reservoir 

table of contents the goal of our lawrence field asp flood project is to duplicate the oil recovery performance of the surfactant polymer floods conducted in the field in the s  but at a significantly lower cost 
we expect this cost reduction to be accomplished by utilizing newer technologies to optimize the synergistic performance of the three chemicals used  and by using alkali in the formula  which would allow us to use a significantly lower concentration of the more costly surfactant 
in  penntex resources illinois  inc  one of our predecessor companies  then known as plains illinois  inc  and the us department of energy conducted a study on the potential of an asp project in the lawrence field  with consulting services provided by an independent engineering firm specializing in the design and implementation of chemical oil recovery systems 
based on the modeling of the reservoir characteristics and laboratory tests with cores taken in the lawrence field  the evaluation found oil recovery in the field could be increased significantly by installing an asp flood 
however  there can be no assurance that our lawrence field asp flood project will achieve similar results to those conducted in the study 
during and  we completed two four acre pilot tests  one each in the bridgeport and cypress sandstones 
both of the pilots demonstrated a response to the chemical injection  as indicated by an increase in both oil production and the oil cut ratio 
each pilot area had individual wells whose oil cut exceeded after the initial response  whereas the oil cuts for both pilots at the time asp injection was initiated were less than 
during  we commenced chemical injection into our acre middagh asp pilot unit and received initial and peak response during  with oil cuts increasing from to approximately  and several wells peaking at an oil cut of 
production has since begun its gradual decline  however the successful response from this project resulted in the assignment of mbbls of estimated proved reserves as of december  approximately mbls of estimated proved reserves are attributable to our delta unit 
we are continuing to move forward with asp expansion with the acre perkins smith project area 
asp injection into the perkins smith occurred in june  with initial production response expected in mid and peak production expected in the fourth quarter of in addition to the perkins smith unit  we have completed the drilling and infrastructure construction phase of our commercial size delta unit with asp injection expected to commence during the fourth quarter of we are in the process of identifying the next asp flood units in the bridgeport and cypress sands 
depending on the size of each flood unit  it is anticipated that initial response time from the chemical injection date will be approximately to months and the time to peak response will be approximately to months 
estimated proved reserves for estimated proved reserves as of december   proved locations were identified  assessed and justified using the evaluation methods of performance analysis  volumetric analysis and analogy 
in addition  reliable technologies were used to support a select number of undeveloped locations in the marcellus shale region 
within the marcellus shale region  we used both public and proprietary geologic data to establish continuity of the formation and its producing properties 
this data included performance data  seismic data  micro seismic analysis  open hole log information and petro physical analysis of the log data  mud logs  log cross sections  gas sample analysis  drill cutting samples  measurements of total organic content  thermal maturity and statistical analysis 
in our development area  these data demonstrated consistent and continuous reservoir characteristics

proved undeveloped reserves puds as of december   our pud reserves totaled mmboe of oil  mmboe of ngls and bcf of natural gas  for a total of bcfe 
the majority of our puds at year end were associated with the appalachian basin 
all of these projects will have puds convert from undeveloped to developed as these projects begin production and or production facilities are expanded or upgraded 
changes in puds that occurred during the year were due to conversion of approximately bcfe attributable to puds into proved developed reserves  bcfe in puds due to extensions and discoveries  which are primarily related to the extension of proved acreage in areas that are prospective for the marcellus  utica and upper devonian burkett shale  through our drilling activities 
during  we drilled approximately gross net wells that were not considered proved in addition to gross net wells that were classified as puds as of december  costs incurred relating to the development of gross net pud locations to proved developed were approximately million in estimated future development costs relating to the development of our gross net puds are projected to be approximately million in  million in  million in  million in and million in most pud drilling locations are scheduled to be drilled prior to the end of  including approximately of the total in initial production from these pud locations is expected to begin between and approximately gross net pud locations were booked based on reliable technology 
we have approximately two gross net pud locations that are to be developed more than five years after first booking 
these wells are a part of a development program which includes multiple wells from the same pad that has been pushed outside of the five year range due to our current strategy of drilling single well pads to hold acreage 
in addition to holding acreage  it is our plan to develop our pud reserves in a manner consistent with the five year rule for pud locations 
the wells that are to be developed outside of the five years from first booking are on pad drilling sites that have additional pud locations which are currently scheduled to be developed within five years of first booking 
we intend to develop these pud locations  regardless of first booking date  in a pad development mode 
we believe that this strategy allows for the wells to remain classified as pud locations 
a total of bcfe of estimated proved reserves are attributed to these wells or approximately of our total estimated proved undeveloped reserves

total net acreage includes approximately  gross  net acres that are owned by us 
these acres are primarily leased to third parties and are not currently deemed as available for development 
substantially all of the undeveloped leases summarized in the preceding table will expire at the end of their respective primary terms unless the existing lease is renewed  we have commenced the necessary operations required by the terms of the lease  or we have obtained actual production from acreage subject to the lease  in which event  the lease will remain in effect until the cessation of production 
the following table sets forth  for our continuing operations  the gross and net acres of undeveloped land subject to leases summarized in the preceding table that will expire during the periods indicated expiring acreage gross net year ending december  thereafter total will not reconcile to total undeveloped acreage due to being subject to drilling commitments and acreage that may be held by production in a legal unit but is still considered undeveloped 
the expiring acreage set forth in the tale above accounts for our total net acreage
