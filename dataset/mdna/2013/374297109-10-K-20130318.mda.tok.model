table of contents part i item business company profile getty realty corp  a maryland corporation  is the leading publicly traded real estate investment trust reit in the united states specializing in the ownership  leasing and financing of retail motor fuel and convenience store properties and petroleum distribution terminals 
our properties are located in states across the united states with concentrations in the northeast and the mid atlantic regions 
our properties are operated under a variety of brands including getty  bp  exxon  mobil  shell  chevron  valero and aloha 
we own the getty trademark and trade name in connection with our real estate and the petroleum marketing business in the united states 
we are self administered and self managed by our management team  which has extensive experience in owning  leasing and managing retail motor fuel and convenience store properties 
we have invested  and will continue to invest  in real estate and real estate related investments  such as mortgage loans  when appropriate opportunities arise 
the history of our company our founders started the business in with the ownership of one gasoline service station in new york city and combined real estate ownership  leasing and management with service station operation and petroleum distribution 
we held our initial public offering in under the name power test corp 
we acquired  from texaco in  the petroleum distribution and marketing assets of getty oil company in the northeast united states along with the getty name and trademark in connection with our real estate and the petroleum marketing business in the united states 
we became one of the leading independent owner operators of petroleum marketing assets in the country  serving retail and wholesale customers through a distribution and marketing network of getty and other branded retail motor fuel and convenience store properties and petroleum distribution terminals 
getty petroleum marketing  inc marketing was formed to facilitate the spin off of our petroleum marketing business to our shareholders which was completed in marketing was acquired by a us subsidiary of oao lukoil lukoil in december in connection with lukoil s acquisition of marketing  we renegotiated our long term unitary triple net lease the master lease with marketing 
on december   marketing filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in the us bankruptcy court  southern district of new york the bankruptcy court 
marketing rejected the master lease pursuant to an order issued by the bankruptcy court  effective april  and possession of the then properties subject to the master lease was returned to us 
as of december   more than properties that we own or lease were previously leased to marketing 
during  we entered into ten long term triple net unitary leases re letting  in the aggregate  operating properties previously leased to marketing 
the new leases generally have year initial terms with provisions for renewal terms and annual rent escalations 
we sold properties for million in the aggregate during as of the date of this filing on form k  in  we have sold an additional properties for million in the aggregate  including one terminal 
certain of the properties previously leased to marketing are subject to month to month licensing agreements and our temporary fuel supply agreement described in more detail below 
the balance of the remaining properties previously leased to marketing are accounted for as held for sale and are either subject to month to month licensing agreements  or are vacant 
since may  we have acquired approximately properties in various states in transactions valued at approximately million 
these acquisitions include single property transactions and portfolio transactions ranging in size from properties with an aggregate value of approximately million up to a portfolio comprised of properties with an aggregate value of approximately million 
company operations as of december   we owned properties and leased properties 
our typical property is used as a retail motor fuel outlet and convenience store  and is located on between one half and three quarters of an acre of land in a metropolitan area 
the properties that we have acquired since are generally located on larger parcels of land 
we believe our network of retail motor fuel and convenience store properties and terminal properties across the northeast and the mid atlantic regions of the united states is unique and that comparable networks of properties are not readily available for purchase or lease from other owners or landlords 
many of our properties are located at highly trafficked urban intersections or conveniently close to highway entrance or exit ramps 
our business model is to lease our properties on a triple net basis primarily to petroleum distributors and to a lesser extent to individual operators 
our tenants operate our properties directly or sublet our properties to operators who operate their gas stations  convenience stores  automotive repair service facilities or other businesses at our properties 
these tenants are responsible for the operations conducted at these properties 
our triple net tenants are generally responsible for the payment of all taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance and other operating expenses relating to our properties 

table of contents in addition  with respect to certain properties that we are repositioning  we have entered into month to month license agreements and interim fuel supply arrangements 
we receive monthly occupancy payments directly from the licensee operators while we remain responsible for certain costs associated with the properties 
these month to month license agreements allow the licensees to occupy and use the properties as gas stations  convenience stores or automotive repair service facilities  and require the licensee operators to sell fuel provided exclusively by a third party  with whom we have contracted for interim fuel supply 
under our agreement with the third party fuel supplier  the third party fuel supplier is required to pay us a fee based in part on gallons sold and we pay to the third party fuel supplier a monthly administrative service fee 
our month to month license agreements differ from our triple net lease arrangements in that  among other things  we are responsible for the payment of certain environmental compliance costs and property operating expenses including maintenance and real estate taxes 
we intend to reposition these properties in order to maximize their value to us taking into account each property s intermediate and long term investment requirements and potential 
as a result of this process  we expect that we may dispose of or lease these remaining properties  either individually or in small portfolios 
we also may make investments in certain of these properties in anticipation of leasing them or by contribution to capital expenditures required to be made by our tenants 
we cannot predict the timing or the terms of any future sales or leases 
substantially all of our tenants financial results depend on the sale of refined petroleum products and rental income from their subtenants 
as a result  our tenants financial results are highly dependent on the performance of the petroleum marketing industry  which is highly competitive and subject to volatility 
in those instances where we determine that the best use for a property is no longer as a gas station  we will seek an alternative tenant or buyer for the property 
as of december   approximately of our properties are leased for uses such as quick serve restaurants  automobile sales and other retail purposes  excluding approximately properties previously subject to the master lease with marketing which are currently held for sale and which have temporary occupancies

for information regarding factors that could adversely affect us relating to our lessees  see part ii  item a 
risk factors 
the sector of the real estate industry in which we operate is highly competitive 
in addition  we expect major real estate investors with significant capital will continue to compete with us for attractive acquisition opportunities 
these competitors include petroleum manufacturing  distributing and marketing companies  other reits  public and private investment funds and other individual and institutional investors 
generally  we seek leases with our tenants that have an initial term of years and include provisions for rental increases during the term of the lease 
as of december   our average lease term including month to month license agreements  weighted by the number of underlying properties  was in excess of years excluding renewal options 
retail motor fuel properties are an integral component of the transportation infrastructure 
stability within the retail motor fuel and convenience store industry is driven by highly inelastic demand for petroleum products and day to day consumer goods and fast foods  which supports our tenants 
we elected to be treated as a reit under the federal income tax laws beginning january  a reit is a corporation  or a business trust that would otherwise be taxed as a corporation  which meets certain requirements of the internal revenue code 
the internal revenue code permits a qualifying reit to deduct dividends paid  thereby effectively eliminating corporate level federal income tax and making the reit a pass through vehicle for federal income tax purposes 
to meet the applicable requirements of the internal revenue code  a reit must  among other things  invest substantially all of its assets in interests in real estate including mortgages and other reits or cash and government securities  derive most of its income from rents from real property or interest on loans secured by mortgages on real property  and distribute to shareholders annually a substantial portion of its otherwise taxable income 
as a reit  we are required to distribute at least of our taxable income to our shareholders each year and would be subject to corporate level federal income taxes on any taxable income that is not distributed 
acquisition strategy and activity as part of our overall growth strategy  we regularly review acquisition and financing opportunities to acquire additional properties  and we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions that we believe will benefit our financial performance 
our investment strategy is aimed at achieving a high quality real estate portfolio and geographic diversification 
we employ investment personnel to pursue acquisitions that are consistent with this strategy 
a key element of our investment strategy is to acquire properties in strong primary markets that serve high density population centers 
we review such opportunities on an ongoing basis and may have one or more potential acquisitions under consideration at any point in time  which may be at varying stages of the negotiation and due diligence review process 
to the extent that our current sources of liquidity are not sufficient to fund such acquisitions  we will require other sources of capital  which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all 

table of contents in  we acquired fee or leasehold title to five gasoline station and convenience store properties in separate transactions valued at million 
in  we acquired fee or leasehold title to gasoline station and convenience store properties in two separate transactions valued at million 
since may  we have acquired approximately properties in various states in transactions valued at approximately million

trademarks we own the getty name and trademark in connection with our real estate and the petroleum marketing business in the united states and we permit certain of our tenants to use the getty trademarks at properties that they lease from us 
regulation we are subject to numerous existing federal  state and local laws and regulations including matters related to the protection of the environment such as the remediation of known contamination and the retirement and decommissioning or removal of long lived assets including buildings containing hazardous materials  underground storage tanks ust or usts and other equipment 
petroleum properties are governed by numerous federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
these laws have included i requirements to report to governmental authorities discharges of petroleum products into the environment and  under certain circumstances  to remediate the soil and or groundwater contamination pursuant to governmental order and directive  ii requirements to remove and replace usts that have exceeded governmental mandated age limitations  and iii the requirement to provide a certificate of financial responsibility with respect to claims relating to ust failures 
our tenants are directly responsible for compliance with various environmental laws and regulations as the operators of our properties 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with federal  state and local provisions enacted or adopted pertaining to environmental matters 
although we are unable to predict what legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future with respect to environmental protection and waste disposal  existing legislation and regulations have had no material adverse effect on our competitive position 
for additional information with respect to pending environmental lawsuits and claims see item legal proceedings 
environmental expenses are principally attributable to remediation costs which include installing  operating  maintaining and decommissioning remediation systems  monitoring contamination  and governmental agency reporting incurred in connection with contaminated properties 
we seek reimbursement from state ust remediation funds related to these environmental expenses where available 
we enter into leases and various other agreements which allocate responsibility for known and unknown environmental liabilities by establishing the percentage and method of allocating responsibility between the parties 
in accordance with leases with certain tenants  we have agreed to bring the leased properties with known environmental contamination to within applicable standards  and to either regulatory or contractual closure closure in an efficient and economical manner 
generally  upon achieving closure at each individual property  our environmental liability under the lease for that property will be satisfied and future remediation obligations will be the responsibility of our tenant 
our tenants are directly responsible to pay for i remediation of environmental contamination they cause and compliance with various environmental laws and regulations as the operators of our properties  and ii environmental liabilities allocated to them under the terms of our leases and various other agreements 
generally  the liability for the retirement and decommissioning or removal of usts and other equipment is the responsibility of our triple net tenants 
we are contingently liable for these obligations in the event that our tenants do not satisfy their responsibilities 
a liability has not been accrued for obligations that are the responsibility of our tenants other than marketing s environmental obligations which we accrued in the fourth quarter of 
however  there can be no assurance that our assessments are correct or that our tenants who have paid their obligations in the past will continue to do so
