overview we provide customized debt and equity financing solutions to lower middle market companies  which we define as us based companies having revenues between million and million 
our investment objective is to provide attractive risk adjusted returns by generating both current income from our debt investments and capital appreciation from our equity related investments 
our investment strategy includes partnering with business owners  management teams and financial sponsors by providing customized financing for ownership transactions  recapitalizations  strategic acquisitions  business expansion and other growth initiatives 
we seek to maintain a diversified portfolio of investments in order to help mitigate the potential effects of adverse economic events related to particular companies  regions or industries 
fidus investment corporation was formed as a maryland corporation on february  on june   fidus investment corporation acquired all of the limited partnership interests of fidus mezzanine capital  lp  or the fund  and membership interests of fidus mezzanine capital gp  llc  its general partner  through the formation transactions as defined in note to the consolidated financial statements  resulting in the fund becoming our wholly owned sbic subsidiary 
immediately following the formation transactions  we and the fund elected to be treated as business development companies  or bdcs  under the act and our investment activities have been managed by fidus investment advisors  llc  our investment advisor  and supervised by our board of directors  a majority of whom are independent of us 
in june  we closed our initial public offering  or ipo  issuing a total of  shares of common stock at a price of per share resulting in net proceeds of million  after deducting underwriting fees and offering costs totaling million 
in september  the company issued  shares in a follow on public offering  including shares purchased by the underwriters pursuant to their exercise of the over allotment option  at an offering price of per share resulting in net proceeds of million after deducting underwriting fees and offering costs totaling million 
additionally  in february  the company issued  shares of common stock in a follow on public offering  including shares purchased by the underwriters pursuant to their exercise of the over allotment option  at an offering price of per share resulting in net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting commissions and offering costs totaling approximately million 
our shares are listed on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol fdus 
the fund is licensed by the us small business administration  or the sba  as a small business investment company  or sbic  and we plan to continue to operate the fund as an sbic  subject to sba approval  and to utilize the proceeds of the sale of sba debentures to enhance returns to our stockholders 
we have also made  and continue to make  investments directly through fidus investment corporation 
we believe that utilizing both entities as investment vehicles provides us with access to a broader array of investment opportunities 
given our access to lower cost capital through the sba s sbic debenture program  we expect that the majority of our investments will continue to be made through the fund 
as of december   we had investments in portfolio companies with an aggregate fair value of million and cost of million 
revenues we generate revenue in the form of interest income on debt investments and capital gains and distributions  if any  on equity investments 
our debt investments  whether in the form of  mezzanine  senior secured or unitranche loans  typically have a term of three to seven years and bear interest at a fixed rate but may bear interest at a floating rate 
in some instances  we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances 
in addition  we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date 
the frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period 
our portfolio activity may reflect the proceeds of sales of securities 
in some cases  our investments provide for deferred interest payments or pik interest 
the principal amount of loans and any accrued but unpaid interest generally become due at the maturity date 
in addition  we may generate revenue in the form of commitment  origination  amendment  or structuring fees and fees for providing managerial assistance 
loan origination fees  original issue discount and market discount or premium  if any  are capitalized  and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income 
we record prepayment premiums on loans as fee income 
interest and dividend income is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that the company expects to collect such amounts 
interest and dividend income is accrued based upon the outstanding principal amount and contractual terms of debt and preferred equity investments 
interest is accrued on a daily basis 
dividend income is recorded as dividends are declared or at the point an obligation exists for the portfolio company to make a distribution 
distributions of earnings from portfolio companies are evaluated to determine if the distribution is income or a return of capital 

table of contents we recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the cost basis of the investment  without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized 
we record current period changes in fair value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments in the consolidated statements of operations

discussion and analysis of results of operations comparison of fiscal years ended december  and december  investment income for the year ended december   total investment income was million  an increase of million  or  over the million of total investment income for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in interest and fee income from investments and a million increase in dividend income 
the increase in interest and fee income is primarily due to higher average levels of outstanding debt investments and higher fee income of million in the year ended december  compared to the prior year period 
the increase in dividend income is primarily attributable to higher levels of dividend producing investments and higher dividend payments from our portfolio companies in compared to expenses for the year ended december   total expenses were million  an increase of million or  over the million of total expenses for the year ended december  the increase in total expenses was attributable to an increase in all expense categories 
the base management fee including management fee offset increased million  incentive fees increased by million and administrative service expenses increased by million primarily due to the new investment advisory and administration agreements in effect for the full year compared to approximately half the year in the investment advisor voluntarily waived the incentive fee of million for the period june  through june  interest expense increased million as a result of higher average balances of sba debentures outstanding during compared to professional fees increased million primarily due to increased legal  accounting and auditing costs associated with being a publicly traded company for the full year in compared to approximately half a year in other general and administrative expenses increased million primarily due to increased director fees  insurance costs and other corporate expenses also related to being a publicly traded company for the full year in net investment income as a result of the million increase in total investment income as compared to the million increase in total expenses  net investment income for the year ended december  was million  which was an increase of million  or  compared to net investment income of million during the year ended december

comparison of fiscal years ended december  and december  investment income for the year ended december   total investment income was million  an increase of million  or  over the million of total investment income for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in interest and fee income from investments  partially offset by a million decrease in dividend income 
the increase in interest and fee income is primarily due to higher average levels of outstanding debt investments and higher fee income of million in the year ended december  compared to the prior year period 
the decrease in dividend income is primarily attributable to lower levels of dividend producing investments in compared to expenses for the year ended december   total expenses were million  an increase of million or  over the million of total expenses for the year ended december  the increase in total expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in incentive and administrative service fees as well as higher interest expense and professional fees partially offset by a decrease in the base management fee after offset transaction fees received in connection with the fund s investments prior to the formation transactions 
incentive fees increased million and administrative fees increased million due to the new investment advisory and administration agreements

as a result of these events  our net increase in net assets resulting from operations during the year ended december   was million  or an increase of million compared to a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of million during the year ended december  
table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  and our net assets totaled million 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents on hand  our available sba leverage and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our cash needs for our daily operations for at least the next months 
we intend to generate additional cash primarily from future offerings of securities  future borrowings as well as cash flows from operations  including income earned from investments in our portfolio companies 
on both a short term and long term basis  our primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies and cash distributions to our stockholders 
cash flows for the year ended december   we experienced a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the amount of million 
during that period  we used million in cash in operating activities  primarily for the funding of million of investments  partially offset by million of principal repayments and sales proceeds received and million of net investment income 
during the same period  we generated million from financing activities  consisting primarily of proceeds from a follow on equity offering of million  net of expenses and proceeds from sba debentures of million 
these increases were partially offset by cash dividends paid to stockholders of million and financing fees paid of million 
for the year ended december   we experienced a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the amount of million 
during that period  we used million in cash in operating activities  primarily for the funding of million of investments  partially offset by million of principal repayments received and million of net investment income 
during the same period  we generated million from financing activities  consisting primarily of proceeds from the ipo including the over allotment of million  net of expenses  capital contributions from partners totaling million and proceeds from sba debentures of million 
these increases were partially offset by cash dividends paid to stockholders of million  capital distributions to the fund s partners prior to the formation transactions of million and financing fees paid of million 
for the year ended december   we experienced a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million 
during that period  we used million in cash in operating activities  primarily for the funding of million of investments  partially offset by million of principal payments received and million of net investment income 
during the same period  we generated million from financing activities  consisting of borrowings under sba debentures of million  partially offset by deferred financing costs paid by us of million and a capital distribution of million 
capital resources we anticipate that we will continue to fund our investment activities on a long term basis through a combination of debt and additional equity capital 
the fund is a licensed sbic  and has the ability to issue debentures guaranteed by the sba at favorable interest rates 
under the small business investment act and the sba rules applicable to sbics  an sbic can have outstanding at any time debentures guaranteed by the sba in an amount up to twice its regulatory capital 
the maximum statutory limit on the dollar amount of outstanding debentures guaranteed by the sba issued by a single sbic as of december  was million 
debentures guaranteed by the sba have fixed interest rates that approximate prevailing year treasury note rates plus a spread and have a maturity of ten years with interest payable semi annually 
the principal amount of the sba debentures is not required to be paid before maturity but may be pre paid at any time 
as of december   the fund had million of outstanding sba debentures  which had a weighted average interest rate of 
based on its million of regulatory capital as of december   the fund has the current capacity to issue up to an additional million of sba debentures 
for more information on the sba debentures the fund has issued  please see note to our consolidated financial statements 
on october   the company submitted an application to the sba for a second sbic license  after receiving a green light letter from the sba on july  allowing the company to proceed with such an application for a second sbic license through which we may issue more sba debentures to fund additional investments 
however  we can make no assurances that the application process will be completed successfully or that the sba will approve such application 
if we are approved by the sba for a second sbic license  the maximum amount of outstanding sba debentures for two or more sbics under common control cannot exceed million 
however  as a bdc  we are generally required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets to total senior securities  which include borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future  of at least 
this requirement limits the amount that we may borrow 
we have received exemptive relief from the securities and exchange commission  or the sec  to allow us to exclude any indebtedness guaranteed by the sba and issued by the fund from the asset coverage requirements  which  in turn  will enable us to fund more investments with debt capital 
as a bdc  we are generally not permitted to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share 
we may  however  sell our common stock  or warrants  options or rights to acquire our common stock  at a price below the then current net asset value per share of our common stock if our board of directors  including independent directors  determines that such sale is in the best interests of us and our stockholders  and if our stockholders approve such sale 
on june   our stockholders voted to allow us to sell or otherwise issue common stock at a price below net asset value per share for a period of one year ending on the earlier of june  or the date of our annual meeting of stockholders 
our stockholders specified that the cumulative number of shares sold in each offering during the one year period ending on the earlier of june  or the date of our annual meeting of stockholders may not exceed of our outstanding common stock immediately prior to each such sale 

table of contents current market conditions though global credit and other financial market conditions have improved and stability has increased throughout the international financial system  the uncertainty surrounding the united states rapidly increasing national debt and continuing global economic malaise have kept markets volatile 
these unstable conditions could continue for a prolonged period of time 
although we have been able to secure access to additional liquidity  including our recent public stock offering and leverage available through the sbic program  there is no assurance that debt or equity capital will be available to us in the future on favorable terms  or at all 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or gaap  requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions affecting amounts reported in the financial statements 
we have identified investment valuation and revenue recognition as our most critical accounting estimates 
we continuously evaluate our estimates  including those related to the matters described below 
these estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
a discussion of our critical accounting policies follows 
valuation of portfolio investments we conduct the valuation of our investments  pursuant to which our net asset value is determined  at all times consistent gaap and the investment company act of  or the act 
our investments generally consist of illiquid securities including debt and equity investments in lower middle market companies 
investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations 
because we expect that there will not be a readily available market for substantially all of the investments in our portfolio  we value substantially all of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors using a documented valuation policy and consistently applied valuation process 
due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value  the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments  and the difference could be material 
with respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available  our board of directors undertakes a multi step valuation process each quarter  as described below our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially evaluated and rated by the investment professionals of our investment advisor responsible for the portfolio investment  preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with the investment committee of our investment advisor  our board of directors also engages one or more independent valuation firms to provide an independent appraisal for each of our investments at least once in every calendar year  and for new portfolio companies  at least once in the twelve month period subsequent to the initial investment  the audit committee of our board of directors reviews the preliminary valuations of our investment advisor and of the independent valuation firm s and responds and supplements the valuation recommendations to reflect any comments  and the board of directors discusses the valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith  based on the input of our investment advisor  the independent valuation firm s and the audit committee 
in making the good faith determination of the value of portfolio investments  we start with the cost basis of the security  which includes the amortized original issue discount and payment in kind income  if any 
the transaction price is typically the best estimate of fair value at inception 
when evidence supports a subsequent change to the carrying value from the original transaction price  adjustments are made to reflect the expected exit values 
we perform detailed valuations of our debt and equity investments  using both the market and income approaches as appropriate 
under the market approach  we typically use the enterprise value methodology to determine the fair value of an investment 
there is no one methodology to estimate enterprise value and  in fact  for any one portfolio company  enterprise value is generally best expressed as a range of values  from which we derive a single estimate of enterprise value 
under the income approach  we typically prepare and analyze discounted cash flow models to estimate the present value of future cash flows of either an individual debt investment or of the underlying portfolio company itself 
we evaluate investments in portfolio companies using the most recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts 
we also consult with the portfolio company s senior management to obtain further updates on the portfolio company s performance  including information such as industry trends  new product development and other operational issues 

table of contents for our debt investments  including senior secured loans and subordinated notes  the primary valuation technique used to estimate the fair value is the discounted cash flow method 
however  if there is deterioration in credit quality or a debt investment is in workout status  we may consider other methods in determining the fair value  including the value attributable to the debt investment from the enterprise value of the portfolio company or the proceeds that would be received in a liquidation analysis 
our discounted cash flow models estimate a range of fair values by applying an appropriate discount rate to the future cash flow streams of our debt investments  based on future interest and principal payments as set forth in the associated loan agreements 
we prepare a weighted average cost of capital for use in the discounted cash flow model for each investment  based on factors including  but not limited to current pricing and credit metrics for similar proposed or executed investment transactions of private companies  the portfolio company s historical financial results and outlook  and the portfolio company s current leverage and credit quality as compared to leverage and credit quality as of the date the investment was made 
we may also consider the following factors when determining the fair value of debt investments the portfolio company s ability to make future scheduled payments  prepayment penalties  estimated remaining life  the nature and realizable value of any collateral  and changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that generally may affect the price at which similar investments may be made 
we estimate the remaining life of our debt investments to generally be the legal maturity date of the instrument  as we generally intend to hold loans to maturity 
however  if we have information available to us that the loan is expected to be repaid in the near term  we would use an estimated remaining life based on the expected repayment date 
for our equity investments  including equity and warrants  we generally use a market approach  including valuation methodologies consistent with industry practice  to estimate the enterprise value of portfolio companies 
typically  the enterprise value of a private company is based on multiples of ebitda  cash flows  net income  revenues  or in limited cases  book value 
in estimating the enterprise value of a portfolio company  we analyze various factors consistent with industry practice  including but not limited to original transaction multiples  the portfolio company s historical and projected financial results  applicable market trading and transaction comparables  applicable market yields and leverage levels  the nature and realizable value of any collateral  the markets in which the portfolio company does business  and comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public 
where applicable  we consider our ability to influence the capital structure of the portfolio company  as well as the timing of a potential exit 
we may also utilize an income approach when estimating the fair value of our equity securities  either as a primary methodology if consistent with industry practice or if the market approach is otherwise not applicable  or as a supporting methodology to corroborate the fair value ranges determined by the market approach 
we typically prepare and analyze discounted cash flow models based on projections of the future free cash flows or earnings of the portfolio company 
we consider various factors  including but not limited to the portfolio company s projected financial results  applicable market trading and transaction comparables  applicable market yields and leverage levels  the markets in which the portfolio company does business  and comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public 
determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates 
accordingly  the notes to our financial statements express the uncertainties with respect to the possible effect of such valuations  and any changes in such valuations  on the financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition policies are as follows investments and related investment income 
realized gains or losses on portfolio investments are calculated based upon the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the cost basis of the investment 
changes in the fair value of investments from the prior period  as determined by our board of directors through the application of our valuation policy  are included as changes in unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments in the consolidated statement of operations 
interest and dividend income 
interest and dividend income is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts 
interest and dividend income is accrued based upon the outstanding principal amount and contractual terms of debt and preferred equity investments 
interest is accrued on a daily basis 
dividend income is recorded as dividends when declared or at the point an obligation exists for the portfolio company to make a distribution 
distributions of earnings from portfolio companies are evaluated to determine if the distribution is income or a return of capital 
payment in kind interest 
we have investments in our portfolio that contain a payment in kind income provision  which represents contractual interest or dividends that are added to the principal balance and are recorded as income 
we stop accruing payment in kind income when it is determined that payment in kind income is no longer collectible 
in addition  to maintain ric tax treatment  substantially all of this income must be paid out to stockholders in the form of distributions  even though we have not yet collected the cash 
we may have difficulty paying our required distributions if we recognize income before  or without  receiving cash representing such income 
warrants 
in connection with our debt investments  we will sometimes receive warrants or other equity related securities  or warrants 
we determine the cost basis of warrants based upon their respective fair values on the date of receipt in proportion to the total fair value of the debt and warrants received 
any resulting difference between the face amount of the debt and its recorded fair value resulting from the assignment of value to the warrants are treated as original issue discount  or oid  and accreted into interest income based on the effective interest method over the life of the debt security 

table of contents fee income 
all transaction fees received in connection with our investments are recognized as income 
such fees typically include fees for services  including structuring and advisory services  provided to portfolio companies 
we recognize income from fees for providing such structuring and advisory services when the services are rendered or the transactions are completed 
upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security  any prepayment penalties are recorded as fee income when received 
prior to the formation transactions  and in accordance with the prior limited partnership agreement  we historically recorded transaction fees provided in connection with our investments as a direct offset to management fee expense 
we also typically receive upfront origination or closing fees in connection with investments 
such upfront origination and closing fees are capitalized as unearned income offset against investments on our statement of assets and liabilities and amortized as additional income over the life of the investment 
non accrual 
loans or preferred equity securities are placed on non accrual status when principal  interest or dividend payments become materially past due  or when there is reasonable doubt that principal  interest or dividends will be collected 
interest payments received on non accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment 
non accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal  interest or dividends are paid and  in management s judgment  are likely to remain current 
recently issued accounting standards in may the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued accounting standards update  or asu   fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards  or ifrss  which we refer to as asu asu represents the converged guidance of the fasb and the international accounting standards board  or iasb  collectively  the standards boards on fair value measurement 
the collective efforts of the standards boards and their staffs  reflected in asu  have resulted in common requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements  including a consistent meaning of the term fair value and enhanced disclosure requirements for investments that do not have readily determinable fair values 
the standards boards have concluded the common requirements will result in greater comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap and ifrss 
the amendments to the fasb codification in asu are to be applied prospectively 
for public entities  the amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after december  we adopted the amendments of asu as of january  see note to the consolidated financial statements for the related disclosures 
the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued asu  balance sheet topic containing new guidance that requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
this guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning on or after january  an entity should provide the disclosures required by those amendments retrospectively for all comparative periods presented 
our effective date is january  the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position 
off balance sheet arrangements we may be a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies 
as of december   we had one off balance sheet arrangement with a portfolio company consisting of a million unfunded revolver commitment 
as of december  we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations as of december  our future fixed commitments for cash payments are as follows total to to and thereafter dollars in thousands sba debentures interest due on sba debentures total we have certain contracts under which we have material future commitments 
we entered into the investment advisory agreement with our investment advisor in accordance with the act 
under the investment advisory agreement  our investment advisor provides us with investment advisory and management services 
we pay the following amounts for these services a a management fee equal to a percentage of the average of our total assets excluding cash and cash equivalents and b an incentive fee based on our performance 
see business management and other agreements investment advisory agreement management fee 

table of contents under the administration agreement  our investment advisor furnishes us with office facilities and equipment  provides us clerical  bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities and provides us with other administrative services necessary to conduct our day to day operations 
see business management and other agreements administration agreement 
if any of our contractual obligations discussed above are terminated  our costs under any new agreements that we enter into may increase 
in addition  we would likely incur significant time and expense in locating alternative parties to provide the services we expect to receive under our investment advisory agreement and our administration agreement 
any new investment advisory agreement would also be subject to approval by our independent board members and our stockholders 
related party transactions we have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties  including the following prior to the consummation of the formation transactions  the fund had entered into a management agreement with fidus capital  llc to manage the day to day operational and investment activities of the fund and was paid management fees 
see note to our consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect both our cost of funding and the valuation of our investment portfolio 
our risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze our risk  to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks and limits by means of reliable administrative and information systems and other policies and programs 
in the future  our investment income may also be affected by changes in various interest rates  including libor and prime rates  to the extent of any debt investments that include floating interest rates 
as of december   all of our debt investments bore interest at fixed rates and all of our pooled sba debentures bore interest at fixed rates 
we also have million in sba debentures that will pool in march at a long term interest rate 
assuming that the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities as of december  and december  were to remain constant  a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our level of interest income from debt investments or interest expense 
because we currently borrow  and plan to borrow in the future  money to make investments  our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest the funds borrowed 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income 
in periods of rising interest rates  our cost of funds would increase  which could reduce our net investment income if there is not a corresponding increase in interest income generated by our investment portfolio
