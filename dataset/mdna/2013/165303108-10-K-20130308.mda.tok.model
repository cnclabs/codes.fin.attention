item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section provides management s discussion of chesapeake and its consolidated subsidiaries  with specific information on results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  as well as discussion of how certain accounting principles affect our financial statements 
it includes management s interpretation of financial results of the company and its operating segments  the factors affecting these results  the major factors expected to affect future operating results as well as investment and financing plans 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
several factors exist that could influence our future financial performance  some of which are described in item a  risk factors 
they should be considered in connection with forward looking statements contained in this report  or otherwise made by or on behalf of us  since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those set out in such forward looking statements 
the following discussions and those later in the document on operating income and segment results include the use of the term gross margin 
gross margin is determined by deducting the cost of sales from operating revenue 
cost of sales includes the purchased cost of natural gas  electricity and propane and the cost of labor spent on direct revenue producing activities 
gross margin should not be considered an alternative to operating income or net income  which are determined in accordance with gaap 
we believe that gross margin  although a non gaap measure  is useful and meaningful to investors as a basis for making investment decisions 
it provides investors with information that demonstrates the profitability achieved by the company under its allowed rates for regulated energy operations and under its competitive pricing structure for unregulated natural gas marketing and propane distribution operations 
our management uses gross margin in measuring our business units performance and has historically analyzed and reported gross margin information publicly 
other companies may calculate gross margin in a different manner 
a introduction we are a diversified utility company engaged  directly or through subsidiaries  in regulated energy businesses  unregulated energy businesses  and other unregulated businesses  including advanced information services

our operations are primarily related to natural gas  electricity and propane  both in the regulated and unregulated sectors  and are generally located on the delmarva peninsula and in florida 
we also have an advanced information services subsidiary  which provides both products and consulting services 
the following is a summary of key factors affecting our businesses and their impacts on our results 
more detailed discussion and analysis are provided in the results of operations section 
growth we continue to see growth in our natural gas businesses from our efforts over the past several years to expand our services by delivering clean burning  environmentally friendly natural gas to customers 
we are identifying and developing additional opportunities that will generate growth over the next several years 
new natural gas transmission services and growth in natural gas distribution customers generated million and million  respectively  in additional gross margin for  compared to these increases in gross margin were related primarily to the continued execution of our strategic plan  including expansion of natural gas service to new areas and conversion of several large commercial and industrial customers to natural gas 
in addition  new services are being initiated by our natural gas transmission subsidiaries in response to increased demand for natural gas service on the delmarva peninsula and in florida  both from our natural gas distribution operations and other unaffiliated customers directly connected to the transmission systems 
major expansion initiatives and customer growth reflected in results in late and during  we expanded natural gas transmission and distribution services to sussex county  delaware and nassau county  florida and also initiated natural gas transmission service in worcester and cecil counties  maryland 
these major expansion initiatives increased our natural gas footprint  delivering natural gas service to areas where it was not previously available 
these initiatives generated million of additional gross margin for our natural gas transmission operations in natural gas distribution service to two large industrial customers in lewes  delaware and two industrial facilities of an existing customer in southeastern sussex county  delaware generated  of additional gross margin for the following table summarizes our major expansion initiatives that have already commenced dollars in thousands chesapeake utilities corporation form k page

the new pipeline was completed and placed in service in december peninsula pipeline is expected to incur approximately  in annual transportation costs upon the completion of the new pipeline  which will reduce this gross margin 
other growth in addition to the recent expansion initiatives  the delmarva natural gas distribution operation has added new large industrial and commercial customers since the beginning of  which generated  in additional gross margin in  compared to growth in residential and other commercial customers on the delmarva peninsula generated  in additional gross margin in customer growth in florida  primarily from commercial and industrial customers  generated  in additional gross margin in future major expansion initiatives and opportunities although not affecting results in  eastern shore entered into precedent agreements with nrg energy center dover llc nrg and pbf energy inc delaware city refinery to further expand its transmission system in order to provide additional services to these customers

the figures provided represent the estimated margin pursuant to the respective precedent agreement 
a firm transportation service agreement will be executed by the parties upon satisfying certain conditions 
this contract is expected to replace the  dts d contract with annualized gross margin of million  which expired in november as we expand our natural gas service to new areas  first through transmission service and distribution service to large industrial customers  our natural gas distribution operations continue to pursue additional opportunities to provide service to residential and other commercial and industrial customers in those areas 
in an effort to increase the availability of natural gas within our delaware service areas  our delaware natural gas distribution division filed an application with the delaware psc in june to add several natural gas expansion service offerings 
these offerings include a monthly fixed charge in lieu of upfront contributions from customers to extend the distribution system and optional service offerings to assist customers in the process of converting to natural gas 
the goal of these new offerings is to meet the energy needs of residents  communities and businesses throughout our service territory  specifically in areas of southeastern sussex county  where natural gas will now be available 
the delaware psc is currently reviewing this application 
acquisition in june  we entered into an agreement with eastern shore gas company and its affiliates collectively esg  which is not related to our interstate natural gas transmission subsidiary to purchase their operating assets for approximately million 
these assets are currently used to provide propane distribution service to approximately  residential and commercial customers in worcester county  maryland  primarily through underground propane gas distribution systems 
we are evaluating the potential conversion of some of these underground propane distribution systems to natural gas where it is economical and feasible 
we filed an application with the maryland psc for approval of the transaction in august the transaction  which is also subject to obtaining consents from certain local jurisdictions to the assignment of certain franchise agreements and the satisfaction of other closing conditions  is expected to be completed in we expect to finance the acquisition using unsecured short term debt 
the acquisition is expected to be accretive to earnings per share in and thereafter 
investing in growth to continue our growth  we are expanding our resources and capabilities 
we are in the early stages of several natural gas distribution expansions on the delmarva peninsula  including expansions into sussex county  delaware  and worcester and cecil counties in maryland 
these expansions will require not only the construction or conversion of distribution facilities  but also the conversion of customers appliances or equipment inside their homes 
we have begun the process of reorganizing our delmarva natural gas distribution operation and expect to increase our staff to support these expansions 
secondly  as a result of bravepoint s growth over the last several quarters  bravepoint is continuing to add team members 
during  bravepoint s other operating expenses increased by million  compared to  due primarily to the additional staff 
finally  to increase our capacity to appropriately manage future growth  resources have been  and continue to be  added in several key functional areas  including  but not limited to  human resources  communications and strategic business development 
during  we incurred  in additional acquisition related costs  compared to  and  in new costs associated with increased capacity for future growth 
we expect additional increases in costs associated with these key functional areas in the future 
weather and consumption weather affects customer energy consumption  especially the consumption by residential and commercial customers during the peak heating and cooling seasons 
natural gas  electricity and propane are all used for heating in our service territories  and we use heating degree days hdd to analyze the weather impact 
only electricity is used for cooling and we use cooling degree days cdd to analyze the weather impact 
a degree day is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature from am to am falls above or below degrees fahrenheit 
each degree of temperature above or below degrees fahrenheit is counted as one cdd or one hdd 
we use year historical averages to define normal weather for this analysis 
chesapeake utilities corporation form k page 
table of contents significantly warmer temperatures in  particularly during the first three months of the year when the demand for natural gas and propane are at their highest  had a large negative impact on our earnings 
lower customer energy consumption directly attributable to warmer temperatures in reduced gross margin by million  compared to temperatures in on the delmarva peninsula and in florida were seven percent hdd and percent hdd  respectively  warmer than compared to normal  temperatures in on the delmarva peninsula and in florida were percent hdd and percent hdd  respectively  warmer and reduced gross margin for by approximately million  compared to gross margin that we would have generated under normal temperatures 
cdd remained relatively unchanged in and  cdd in florida in  compared to  cdd in florida in and did not result in a significant variance in our gross margin 
other regulatory matters in january  the florida psc issued an order approving the recovery of million as an acquisition adjustment and million in merger related costs in connection with chesapeake s acquisition of fpu in the inclusion of the acquisition adjustment and merger related costs in our rate base and the recovery of these assets through amortization expense increase our earnings and cash flows above what we would have achieved absent the regulatory approval 
the acquisition adjustment and merger related costs are to be amortized over years and five years  respectively  beginning in november based upon the effective date and outcome of the order  we recorded the amortization as an expense beginning in  which resulted in an increase in amortization expense of million in we expect to record million million  net of tax in amortization expense in  million million  net of tax in  and million million  net of tax annually thereafter until in fpu s future rate proceedings  if it is determined that the level of cost savings supporting recovery of the acquisition adjustment no longer exists  the remaining acquisition adjustment may be partially or entirely disallowed by the florida psc 
if such an event were to occur  we would have to expense the corresponding unamortized amount of the disallowed acquisition adjustment 
in november  the florida psc issued an order approving the recognition of a million regulatory liability for fpu for a one time tax contingency gain  including income tax gross up  to be amortized over a period from january to october this tax contingency gain is related to an income tax liability recorded by fpu prior to the merger with chesapeake 
as the liability no longer exists  upon receiving the florida psc order  we recorded an amortization credit of  in  which was recorded in the fourth quarter 
in addition to regulatory proceedings  we were involved in a legal dispute over alleged breaches of a franchise agreement by fpu 
prior to the scheduled trial date  fpu and the city of marianna reached an agreement in principle to resolve their dispute  which resulted in the city of marianna dismissing its legal action with prejudice on february  the agreement in principle requires the city of marianna and fpu to negotiate and prepare a formal settlement agreement that is subject to approval by fpu s board of directors and the city commission of marianna  florida the marianna commission 
the settlement agreement would contemplate  in pertinent part  the sale of fpu s facilities within the city of marianna s corporate limits to the city of marianna and  in connection therewith  require the city of marianna to enter into an operating agreement with fpu pursuant to which fpu will operate and maintain the facilities sold to the city of marianna 
fpu serves approximately  customers in the city of marianna 
total litigation expense associated with the city of marianna litigation is approximately million as of december  these costs have been expensed as incurred  however  the florida psc has permitted fpu to seek recovery in a future rate proceeding

table of contents propane prices propane prices affect both retail and wholesale marketing margins 
our propane distribution operation usually benefits from rising propane prices by selling propane to its customers based upon higher wholesale prices  while its average cost of inventory trails behind 
retail prices generally take into account replacement cost  along with other factors  such as competition and market conditions 
when wholesale prices replacement costs increase  retail prices generally increase  and our margins expand until the current wholesale price is fully reflected in the average cost of inventory 
the opposite occurs when propane prices decline 
our propane wholesale marketing operation benefits from price volatility in the propane wholesale market by entering into trading transactions 
our propane distribution operations generated additional gross margin of million due to higher retail margins per gallon in  compared to sustained retail pricing in response to local market conditions  along with lower propane inventory costs as a result of declining wholesale prices and favorable supply plans  contributed to this increase in retail margins per gallon 
xeron executed trades with higher margins in  compared to  as the market presented opportunities resulting from fluctuations in wholesale propane prices during xeron generated  of additional gross margin in  compared to advanced information services in september  bravepoint  our advanced information services subsidiary  released a new product  profitzoom  an integrated system encompassing financial  job costing and service management modules  which was designed specifically for the fire protection and specialty contracting industries 
profitzoom was built as a successor product to another software solution that bravepoint previously marketed and supported for companies in the fire suppression industry 
understanding the needs of the industry and utilizing its technology expertise  bravepoint began developing the profitzoom product in in addition  bravepoint is utilizing a component of profitzoom  application evolution  to provide services to new and existing customers both in the fire suppression industry and other unrelated businesses 
bravepoint generated million in revenue from the sale of these two products and related services during  compared to  in to date  bravepoint has successfully implemented or is currently implementing profitzoom for eight customers in the fire suppression industry 
application evolution is currently utilized by nine customers 
these profitzoom and application evolution contracts are expected to generate approximately  in additional revenue over the next months 
additional sales proposals are under consideration by both existing and potential new customers

table of contents c critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in accordance with gaap 
application of these accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingencies during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
since most of our businesses are regulated and the accounting methods used by these businesses must comply with the requirements of the regulatory bodies  the choices available are limited by these regulatory requirements 
in the normal course of business  estimated amounts are subsequently adjusted to actual results that may differ from estimates 
management believes that the following policies require significant estimates or other judgments of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these policies and their application have been reviewed by our audit committee 
regulatory assets and liabilities as a result of the ratemaking process  we record certain assets and liabilities in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  regulated operations  and consequently  the accounting principles applied by our regulated energy businesses differ in certain respects from those applied by the unregulated businesses 
costs are deferred when there is a probable expectation that they will be recovered in future revenues as a result of the regulatory process 
as more fully described in item under the heading notes to the consolidated financial statements note  summary of significant accounting policies  we have recorded regulatory assets of million and regulatory liabilities of million at december  if we were required to terminate application of asc topic  we would be required to recognize all such deferred amounts as a charge or a credit to earnings  net of applicable income taxes 
such an adjustment could have a material effect on our results of operations 
valuation of environmental assets and liabilities as more fully described in item under the heading notes to the consolidated financial statements note  environmental commitments and contingencies  we are currently participating in the investigation  assessment or remediation of six former mgp sites 
we have also been in discussions with the maryland department of environment mde regarding a seventh former mgp site 
amounts have been recorded as environmental liabilities and associated environmental regulatory assets based on estimates of future costs to remediate these sites  which are provided by independent consultants  and future recovery of those costs in rates 
at december   we had million in environmental liabilities  representing our estimate of such future costs 
we also had million in regulatory and other assets  representing the amount of our environmental remediation costs to be recovered in future rates 
there is uncertainty in these amounts  because the united states environmental protection agency epa  or other applicable state environmental authority  may not have selected the final remediation methods 
in addition  there is uncertainty with regard to amounts that may be recovered from other potentially responsible parties 
derivatives we use derivative and non derivative instruments to manage the risks related to obtaining adequate supplies and the price fluctuations of natural gas  electricity and propane 
we also use derivative instruments to engage in propane wholesale marketing activities 
we continually monitor the use of these instruments to ensure compliance with our risk management policies and account for them in accordance with appropriate gaap 
if these instruments do not meet the definition of derivatives or are considered normal purchases and sales  they are accounted for on an accrual basis of accounting 
the following is a review of our use of derivative instruments at december  and during and  our natural gas distribution  electric distribution  propane distribution and natural gas marketing operations entered into physical contracts for the purchase or sale of natural gas  electricity and propane 
these contracts either did not meet the definition of derivatives as they did not have a minimum requirement to purchase sell or were considered normal purchases and sales  as they provided for the purchase or sale of natural gas  electricity or propane to be delivered in quantities expected to be used and sold by our operations over a reasonable period of time in the normal course of business 
accordingly  these contracts were accounted for on an accrual basis of accounting 
chesapeake utilities corporation form k page 
table of contents during  our propane distribution operation entered into call options to protect against an increase in propane prices associated with the propane purchased for the propane price cap program in december through march we accounted for the call options as fair value hedges  and the change in fair value of  effectively reduced the propane inventory balance at december  during  our propane distribution operation entered into a put option to protect against the decline in propane prices and related potential inventory losses associated with the propane purchased for the propane price cap program in the upcoming heating season 
we accounted for the put option as a fair value hedge 
since the propane prices fell below the strike price of per gallon in january through march of  we received  representing the difference between the market price and the strike price during those months 
xeron  our propane wholesale marketing subsidiary  enters into forward  futures and other contracts that are considered derivatives 
these contracts are marked to market  using prices at the end of each reporting period  and unrealized gains or losses are recorded in the consolidated statements of income as revenue or expense 
these contracts generally mature within one year and are almost exclusively for propane commodities 
for and  these contracts had net unrealized losses of  and net unrealized gains of  respectively 
we had  in mark to market energy assets and  in mark to market energy liabilities related to these contracts at december  we had million in mark to market energy assets and million in mark to market energy liabilities related to these contracts at december  operating revenues revenues for our natural gas and electric distribution operations are based on rates approved by the psc of each state in which we operate 
eastern shore s revenues are based on rates approved by the ferc 
customers base rates may not be changed without formal approval by these commissions 
the pscs  however  have authorized our regulated operations to negotiate rates  based on approved methodologies  with customers that have competitive alternatives 
the ferc has also authorized eastern shore to negotiate rates above or below the ferc approved maximum rates  which customers can elect as an alternative to negotiated rates 
for regulated deliveries of natural gas and electricity  we read meters and bill customers on monthly cycles that do not coincide with the accounting periods used for financial reporting purposes 
we accrue unbilled revenues for natural gas and electricity that have been delivered  but not yet billed  at the end of an accounting period to the extent that they do not coincide 
we estimate the amount of the unbilled revenue by jurisdiction and customer class 
a similar computation is made to accrue unbilled revenues for propane customers with meters  such as community gas system customers  and natural gas marketing customers  whose billing cycles do not coincide with the accounting periods 
the propane wholesale marketing operation records trading activity for open contracts on a net mark to market basis in the statement of income 
for propane bulk delivery customers without meters and advanced information services customers  we record revenue in the period the products are delivered and or services are rendered 
each of our natural gas distribution operations in delaware and maryland  our bundled natural gas distribution service in florida and our electric distribution operation in florida has a fuel cost recovery mechanism 
this mechanism provides us with a method of adjusting billing rates to customers to reflect changes in the cost of purchased fuel 
the difference between the current cost of fuel purchased and the cost of fuel recovered in billed rates is deferred and accounted for as either unrecovered fuel cost or amounts payable to customers 
generally  these deferred amounts are recovered or refunded within one year 
we charge flexible rates to industrial interruptible customers on our natural gas distribution systems to compete with the price of alternative fuel that they can use 
neither we nor any of our interruptible customers are contractually obligated to deliver or receive natural gas on a firm service basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to collect based upon our collections experience  the condition of the overall economy and our assessment of our customers inability or reluctance to pay 
if circumstances change  however  our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable may also change 
circumstances which could affect our estimates include  but are not limited to  customer credit issues  the level of natural gas  electricity and propane prices and general economic conditions 
accounts are written off once they are deemed to be uncollectible

table of contents pension and other postretirement benefits pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets  estimates of the expected returns on plan assets  assumed discount rates  the level of contributions made to the plans  and current demographic and actuarial mortality data 
the assumed discount rates and the expected returns on plan assets are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on the pension costs and liabilities 
the assumed discount rates  the assumed health care cost trend rates and the assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities 
additional information is presented in item under the heading notes to the consolidated financial statements note  employee benefit plans  including plan asset investment allocation  estimated future benefit payments  general descriptions of the plans  significant assumptions  the impact of certain changes in assumptions  and significant changes in estimates

the total costs for include a curtailment gain of  associated with a plan change for the postretirement medical plan for fpu  effective january    of which was recorded in and the remaining portion was deferred as a regulatory liability 
the total costs for included  of settlement charges associated with the retirement of a former executive 
we expect to record pension and postretirement benefit costs of approximately  for actuarial assumptions affecting include expected long term rates of return on plan assets of percent and percent for chesapeake s pension plan and fpu s pension plan  respectively  and discount rates of percent and percent for chesapeake s and fpu s plans  respectively 
the discount rate for each plan was determined by management considering high quality corporate bond rates  such as moody s aa bond index and the citigroup yield curve  changes in those rates from the prior year and other pertinent factors  including the expected lives of the plans and the availability of the lump sum payment option 
actual changes in the fair value of plan assets and the differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension and postretirement benefit costs that we ultimately recognize 
a percent decrease in the discount rate could increase our annual pension and postretirement costs by approximately  and a percent increase could decrease our annual pension and postretirement costs by approximately  a percent change in the rate of return could change our annual pension cost by approximately  and would not have an impact on the postretirement and supplemental executive retirement plans because these plans are not funded

we rely on cash generated from operations  short term borrowings  and other sources to meet normal working capital requirements and to finance capital expenditures 
our energy businesses are weather sensitive and seasonal 
we normally generate a large portion of our annual net income and subsequent increases in our accounts receivable in the first and fourth quarters of each year due to significant volumes of natural gas  electricity  and propane delivered by our natural gas  electric  and propane distribution operations to customers during the peak heating season

we evaluate whether to refinance existing debt or permanently refinance existing short term borrowing  based in part on the fluctuation in interest rates 
our propane distribution business is exposed to market risk as a result of propane storage activities and entering into fixed price contracts for supply 
we can store up to approximately million gallons of propane including leased storage and rail cars during the winter season to meet our customers peak requirements and to serve metered customers 
decreases in the wholesale price of propane may cause the value of stored propane to decline 
to mitigate the impact of price fluctuations  we have adopted a risk management policy that allows the propane distribution operation to enter into fair value hedges or other economic hedges of our inventory 
in may  our propane distribution operation entered into call options to protect against an increase in propane prices associated with  gallons purchased for the propane price cap program from december through march the call options are exercised if the propane prices rise above the strike prices  which range from per gallon to per gallon during this four month period

we had paid  to purchase the put option  and we accounted for it as a fair value hedge 
our propane wholesale marketing operation is a party to natural gas liquids forward contracts  primarily propane contracts  with various third parties 
these contracts require that the propane wholesale marketing operation purchase or sell natural gas liquids at a fixed price at fixed future dates 
at expiration  the contracts are typically settled financially without taking physical delivery of propane 
the propane wholesale marketing operation also enters into futures contracts that are traded on the intercontinentalexchange 
in certain cases  the futures contracts are settled by the payment or receipt of a net amount equal to the difference between the current market price of the futures contract and the original contract price  however  they may also be settled by physical receipt or delivery of propane 
the forward and futures contracts are entered into for trading and wholesale marketing purposes 
the propane wholesale marketing business is subject to commodity price risk on its open positions to the extent that market prices for natural gas liquids deviate from fixed contract settlement prices 
market risk associated with the trading of futures and forward contracts is monitored daily for compliance with our risk management policy  which includes volumetric limits for open positions 
to manage exposures to changing market prices  open positions are marked up or down to market prices and reviewed daily by our oversight officials 
in addition  the risk management committee reviews periodic reports on markets and the credit risk of counter parties  approves any exceptions to the risk management policy within limits established by the board of directors and authorizes the use of any new types of contracts

table of contents i competition our natural gas and electric distribution operations and our natural gas transmission operations compete with other forms of energy  including natural gas  electricity  oil  propane and other alternative sources of energy 
the principal competitive factors are price and  to a lesser extent  accessibility 
our natural gas distribution operations have several large volume industrial customers that are able to use fuel oil as an alternative to natural gas 
when oil prices decline  these interruptible customers may convert to oil to satisfy their fuel requirements  and our interruptible sales volumes may decline 
oil prices  as well as the prices of other fuels  fluctuate for a variety of reasons  therefore  future competitive conditions are not predictable 
to address this uncertainty  we use flexible pricing arrangements on both the supply and sales sides of this business to compete with alternative fuel price fluctuations 
as a result of eastern shore s conversion to open access and chesapeake s florida natural gas distribution division s restructuring of its services  these businesses have shifted from providing bundled transportation and sales service to providing only transmission and contract storage services 
our electric distribution operation currently does not face substantial competition because the electric utility industry in florida has not been deregulated 
in addition  natural gas is the only viable alternative fuel to electricity in our electric service territories and is available only in a small area 
our natural gas distribution operations in delaware  maryland and florida offer unbundled transportation services to certain commercial and industrial customers 
in  chesapeake s florida natural gas distribution division  central florida gas  extended such service to residential customers 
with such transportation service available on our distribution systems  we are competing with third party suppliers to sell gas to all customers 
with respect to unbundled transportation services  our competitors include interstate transmission companies  if the distribution customers are located close enough to a transmission company s pipeline to make connections economically feasible 
the customers at risk are usually large volume commercial and industrial customers with the financial resources and capability to bypass our existing distribution operations in this manner 
in certain situations  our distribution operations may adjust services and rates for these customers to retain their business 
we expect to continue to expand the availability of unbundled transportation service to additional classes of distribution customers in the future 
we have also established a natural gas marketing operation in florida  delaware and maryland to provide such service to customers eligible for unbundled transportation services 
our propane distribution operations compete with several other propane distributors in their respective geographic markets  primarily on the basis of service and price 
we emphasize responsive and reliable service 
our competitors generally include local outlets of national distributors and local independent distributors  whose proximity to customers entails lower costs to provide service 
propane competes with electricity as an energy source  because it is typically less expensive than electricity  based on equivalent unit of heat value 
propane also competes with home heating oil as an energy source 
since natural gas has historically been less expensive than propane  propane is generally not distributed in geographic areas served by natural gas pipeline or distribution systems 
the propane wholesale marketing operation competes against various regional and national marketers  many of which have significantly greater resources and are able to obtain price or volumetric advantages 
our advanced information services subsidiary faces significant competition from a number of larger competitors having substantially greater resources available to them than does our subsidiary 
in addition  changes in the advanced information services business are occurring rapidly and could adversely affect the markets for the products and services offered by these businesses 
this segment competes on the basis of technological expertise  reputation and price

table of contents j inflation inflation affects the cost of supply  labor  products and services required for operations  maintenance and capital improvements 
while the impact of inflation has remained low in recent years  natural gas and propane prices are subject to rapid fluctuations 
in the regulated natural gas and electric distribution operations  fluctuations in natural gas and electricity prices are passed on to customers through the fuel cost recovery mechanism in our tariffs 
to help cope with the effects of inflation on our capital investments and returns  we seek rate increases from regulatory commissions for our regulated operations and closely monitor the returns of our unregulated business operations 
to compensate for fluctuations in propane gas prices  we adjust propane selling prices to the extent allowed by the market
