item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our business 
we are a manufacturer  marketer and distributor of a diversified range of homeopathic and health products that are offered to the general public 
we are also engaged in the research and development of potential natural based health products along with supplement and cosmeceutical products 
our primary business is the manufacture  distribution  marketing and sale of over the counter otc cold remedy products to consumers through food  multi outlet pharmacy and chain drug stores  large wholesalers and mass merchandisers 
one flagship brand is cold eeze cold remedy and our principal product is cold eeze zinc gluconate lozenges  proven in clinical studies to reduce the duration of the common cold by 
cold eeze is an established product in the health care and cold remedy market 
for fiscal  and  our revenues from continuing operations have come principally from our otc cold remedy products 
recent events revenue growth we have implemented a business and marketing strategy designed to deliver results to our stockholders over the long term 
this multi phase strategy was implemented during the cold season 
generally  a cold season is defined as the period of september to march cold season when the incidence of the common cold rises as a consequence of the change in weather and other factors 
our strategic initiatives included preserving the cold eeze brand  then repositioning the cold eeze brand for growth and then leveraging the cold eeze brand 
as we have consistently explained to our shareholders  it remains our view that by investing in our cold eeze brand  we are building our distribution platform and pipeline 
we have made important investments in new product development  consumer and healthcare professional education and consumer and retail based marketing 
each of these strategic components  when aggregated  have led to securing increased shelf space with our retailers for the cold season  and which have provided us with the opportunity to introduce new and improved products  including the national launch of two additional cold remedy products for the cold season cold eeze oral spray and cold eeze daytime nighttime quickmelts 
through our strategic initiatives our net sales increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal this growth is incremental to the net sales growth of achieved in fiscal as compared to fiscal we have increased our net sales an aggregate of in fiscal as compared to fiscal settlement benefit in november we commenced an action against john c 
godfrey  nancy jane godfrey  and godfrey science and design  inc together the godfreys for injunctive relief regarding the ownership of the cold eeze trademark  the godfreys subsequently asserted against us counterclaims and sought monetary damages and injunctive and declaratory relief relative to the cold eeze trademark and other intellectual property 
on december   we and the godfreys  including the estate of nancy jane godfrey  entered into a settlement agreement and mutual general release the settlement agreement  pursuant to which we resolved all disputes  including claims asserted by us and counterclaims asserted against us in the action 
pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement  we paid the godfreys million in december and we agreed to make four additional annual payments of  due in december of each of the next four years 
each annual payment in the amount of  will accrue interest at the per annum rate of 
under the settlement agreement  the godfreys assigned  transferred and conveyed to us all of their right  title  and interest in us trademark registration no 
 for the trademark cold eeze  among other intellectual property associated with such trademark 
as a result of the settlement agreement  we realized million benefit due to the reduction of the previously recorded accrued royalties and commission obligation of million 
phusion laboratories  llc  joint venture on march   we  phosphagenics limited psi parent  an australian corporation  phosphagenics inc psi  a delaware corporation and subsidiary of psi parent  and phusion laboratories  llc the joint venture  a delaware limited liability company  entered into a limited liability company agreement the llc agreement of the joint venture and additional related agreements for the purpose of developing and commercializing  for worldwide distribution and sale  a wide range of non prescription remedies using psi parent s proprietary patented tpm technology tpm 
tpm facilitates the delivery and depth of penetration of active molecules in pharmaceutical  nutraceutical  and other products 
pursuant to the llc agreement  we and psi each own a membership interest in the joint venture 
during fiscal and due to multiple factors affecting our capital position  including the payment we made in december under the settlement agreement and some of the product market research performed  we expect to modify the joint venture s product development plans to stagger and or defer into future periods certain product development initiatives due to the pre commercialization investments required 
we expect to continue pre commercialization research and product development initiatives during the latter half of fiscal furthermore  we do not expect that the joint venture will derive any meaningful revenues  if any  until its commercialization efforts are completed which is not expected to occur until at the earliest the latter half of fiscal when we traditionally seek to launch new products 
expression of interest in a letter dated may   we received an expression of interest and a non binding proposal to be acquired by matrixx initiatives  inc matrixx 
matrixx is the owner of the zicam brand of cold and allergy products and is a direct competitor to our cold eeze cold remedy product line 
at a meeting of the board of directors held on june   our board of directors  after careful consideration and consultation with its advisors  unanimously voted to reject the matrixx proposal 
on september   matrixx purchased for  a three year option to acquire  shares of our common stock for per share from guy j 
quigley  our former chairman and chief executive officer 
matrixx also acquired from mr 
quigley a voting proxy to vote the shares subject to the option 
in a letter to us dated september   matrixx then repeated its non binding proposal on the same terms as its may  letter to prophase 
matrixx repeated the identical non binding proposal in a september  letter 
on october   we received a revised non binding proposal  on essentially the same terms as matrixx earlier offer  except that in this latest proposal matrixx raised the proposed price by per share 
in response  we again sought advice from its independent financial advisors 
at a meeting held on october   our board of directors unanimously voted to reject this latest matrixx proposal after careful consideration and consultation with its advisors 
on february   matrixx informed us that it has withdrawn its unsolicited offer to acquire us 
income taxes as of december   we have net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million for federal purposes that will expire beginning in fiscal through additionally  there are net operating loss carry forwards of million for state purposes that will expire beginning in fiscal through until sufficient taxable income to offset the temporary timing differences attributable to operations  the tax deductions attributable to option  warrant and stock activities are assured  a valuation allowance equaling the total deferred tax asset is being provided 
as a consequence of the accumulated losses of the company  we believe that this allowance is required due to the uncertainty of realizing these tax benefits in the future 
seasonality of the business our sales are derived principally from our otc cold remedy products 
a significant portion of our business is highly seasonal  which causes major variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
the third and fourth quarters generally represent the largest sales volume for our otc cold remedy products with a corresponding increase in marketing and advertising expenditures designed to promote our products during the cold season defined below 
in addition  our sales are influenced by and subject to fluctuations in the timing of purchase and the ultimate level of demand for our products which are a function of the timing  length and severity of each cold season 
we track health and wellness trends and develop retail promotional strategies to align its production scheduling  inventory management and marketing programs to optimize consumer purchases 
results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal net sales for fiscal increased million  or  to million as compared to million for fiscal the increase in net sales is principally due to i an increase in our retail customers purchases in the first and fourth quarter of fiscal  as compared to the same periods in fiscal  in an effort by those retailers to maintain adequate shelf and warehouse stock during peak seasonal demand to meet an increase in consumer demand at retail of our otc cold remedy products  ii sales of our cold eeze cold remedy daytime nighttime quickmelts  a new product launched in july and cold eeze cold remedy oral spray initially launched in august and expanded its distribution in fiscal in addition  our net sales of our contract manufacturing operations increased  in fiscal to million as compared to  in fiscal due to fluctuations in contract manufacturing orders from non related third party entities to produce lozenge based products

in addition  we continue to support our cold eeze cold remedy products through traditional techniques such as in store promotion  media advertising and other programs

we realized gross margins of for fiscal  as compared to in fiscal  a decrease of 
our gross margin reflects the net effect of i an increase in the absorption rate of fixed production overhead costs as a percentage of revenues as a consequence of increased shipments to retailers  offset by ii an increase in raw ingredient and packaging costs and iii an increase in retail merchandising and promotions

interest and other income for fiscal was  as compared to  for fiscal the decrease of  for fiscal as compared to fiscal was principally the result of decreased bank balances and lower interest rates 
as noted above  we have net operating loss carry forwards for both federal and certain states

on november   we entered into the equity line of credit agreement such arrangement  the equity line with dutchess whereby dutchess committed to purchase  subject to certain restrictions and conditions  up to  shares of our common stock  over a period of months from the first trading day following the effectiveness of the registration statement registering the resale of shares purchased by dutchess pursuant to the equity line 
on november   we filed a registration statement with securities and exchange commission sec to register for sale for up to  shares of our common stock and the registration statement was deemed effective by the sec on december  we may draw on the facility from time to time  as and when we determine appropriate in accordance with the terms and conditions of the equity line 
the maximum amount that we are entitled to put to dutchess in any one draw down notice is the greater of i of the average daily volume of our common stock traded on the nasdaq global market for the one trading day prior to the date of delivery of the applicable draw down notice  multiplied by the closing price for such trading day  or ii  the purchase price under the equity line is set at ninety five percent of the lowest daily volume weighted average price vwap of our common stock during the five consecutive trading day period beginning on the date of delivery of the applicable draw down notice 
we have the right to withdraw all or any portion of any put  except that portion of the put that has already been sold to a third party  including any portion of a put that is below the minimum acceptable price set forth on the put notice  before the closing 
in the event dutchess receives more than a five percent return on the net sales for a specific put  dutchess must remit such excess proceeds to us  however  in the event dutchess receives less than a five percent return on the net sales for a specific put dutchess has the right to use any such excess proceeds to off set against the aggregated deficit proceeds 
there are put restrictions applied on days between the draw down notice date and the closing date with respect to that particular put 
during such time  we are not allowed to deliver another draw down notice 
in addition  dutchess is not obligated to purchase shares if its total number of shares beneficially held at that time would exceed of the number of shares of our common stock as determined in accordance with rule d j of the securities exchange act 
in addition  we are not permitted to draw on the facility unless there is an effective registration statement to cover the resale of the shares 
in december  we sold an aggregate of  shares of common stock to dutchess under and pursuant to the equity line 
we derived approximately million in net proceeds through the usage of the equity line of which we received  of such proceeds prior to december  and we have included in receivables the balance of  which we received on january  on march   we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock under and pursuant to the equity line and derived net proceeds of  the sales of the shares under the equity line were deemed to be exempt from registration under the securities act in reliance upon section or regulation d promulgated thereunder 
at march   we have  shares of our common stock available for sale  at our discretion  under the terms of the equity line and covered pursuant to a registration statement 
management believes that its strategy to maintain cold eeze as a recognized brand name  its broader range of products  its adequate manufacturing capacity  together with its current working capital and its available equity credit line  if exercised  should provide a source of capital to fund normal business operations 
our operations support the current research and development expenditures related to new products 
in addition to the funding from operations  we may in the short and long term raise capital through the issuance of securities through our equity credit line or secure other financing sources to support such product development research  new product acquisitions or a venture investment or acquisition 
such funding through the issuance of equity securities would result in the dilution of current stockholders ownership in the company 
should our product development initiatives progress on certain formulations  additional development expenditures may require substantial financial support and may necessitate the consideration of alternative approaches such as licensing  joint venture  or partnership arrangements that we determine will meet our long term goals and objectives 
ultimately  should internal working capital be insufficient and external funding methods or other business arrangements become unattainable  it would likely result in the deferral or abandonment of future development relative to current and prospective product development initiatives and formulations 
pursuant to the llc agreement  we and psi each own a membership interest in the joint venture 
psi parent will conduct and oversee much of the product development  formulation  testing and other research and development needed by the joint venture  and we will oversee much of the production  distribution  sales and marketing 
the llc agreement provides that each member may be required  from time to time and subject to certain limitations  to make capital contributions to the joint venture to fund its operations  in accordance with agreed upon budgets for products to be developed 
specifically  we contributed in fiscal  in cash as initial capital and we are committed to fund up to million  subject to agreed upon budgets which have not been established to date  toward the initial development and marketing costs of new products for the joint venture 
the newly formed joint venture has not engaged in any financial transactions  other than organizational expenses and general market and initial product evaluation and analysis 
at december   cash and equivalents includes  which is expected to be used by the joint venture to fund future product development initiatives currently under consideration by psi parent  psi and us 
management is not aware of any trends  events or uncertainties that have or are reasonably likely to have a material negative impact upon our i short term or long term liquidity  or ii net sales or income from continuing operations 
any challenge to our patent rights could have a material adverse effect on our future  however  we are not aware of any condition that would make such an event probable 
our business is subject to seasonal variations thereby impacting liquidity and working capital during the course of our fiscal year 
management believes that cash generated from operations  along with its current cash balances  will be sufficient to finance working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  in the longer term  as previously discussed  we may require additional capital to support  among other items  i new product introductions  ii expansion of our product marketing and promotion activities  iii additional research development activities  iv further investment in our joint venture  iv venture investments or acquisitions and or v support current operations 
since late fiscal  there has been substantial volatility and a decline in the capital and financial markets due at least in part to the constricted global economic environment resulting in substantial uncertainty and access to financing is uncertain 
moreover  consumer and as a consequence  customer spending habits may be adversely affected by the current economic crisis 
these conditions could have an adverse effect on our industry and business  including our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
to the extent that we do not generate sufficient cash from operations  we may need to incur indebtedness to finance plans for growth 
recent turmoil and stagnation in the credit markets and the potential impact on the liquidity of major financial institutions may have an adverse effect on our ability to fund our business strategy through borrowings  under either existing or newly created instruments in the public or private markets on terms that we believe to be reasonable  if at all 
our future contractual obligations and commitments at december  consist of the following in thousands year employment contracts settlment agreement total total   off balance sheet arrangements it is not our usual business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements such as guarantees on loans and financial commitments and retained interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity for securitization purposes 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
impact of inflation we are subject to normal inflationary trends and anticipate that any increased costs would be passed on to our customers 
inflation has not had a material effect on our business 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this part ii 
however  certain accounting policies are deemed critical  as they require management s highest degree of judgment  estimates and assumptions 
these accounting estimates and disclosures have been discussed with the audit committee of our board of directors 
a discussion of our critical accounting policies  the judgments and uncertainties affecting their application and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions are as follows revenue recognition sales allowances when providing for the appropriate sales returns  allowances  cash discounts and cooperative incentive promotion costs sales allowances  we apply a uniform and consistent method for making certain assumptions for estimating these provisions 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time the financial statements are prepared 
management reviews the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments on a quarterly basis 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our primary product  cold eeze lozenges  utilizes a proprietary zinc gluconate formulation which has been clinically proven to reduce the severity and duration of common cold symptoms 
factors considered in estimating the appropriate sales returns and allowances for this product include it being i a unique product with limited competitors  ii competitively priced  iii promoted  iv unaffected for remaining shelf life as there is no product expiration date and v monitored for inventory levels at major customers and third party consumption data

effect of recent accounting pronouncements in november  the sec issued for comment a proposed roadmap regarding the potential use by us issuers of financial statements prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs 
ifrs is a comprehensive series of accounting standards published by the international accounting standards board iasb 
the proposed roadmap has since been superseded by an sec work plan and no date is currently proposed that we could be required to prepare financial statements in accordance with ifrs 
the sec has targeted fiscal to make a determination regarding the mandatory adoption of ifrs 
we are currently assessing the impact that this potential change would have on our consolidated financial statements and we will continue to monitor the development of the potential implementation of ifrs 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 comprehensive income asu topic presentation of comprehensive income  asu which amends current comprehensive income guidance 
this accounting update eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of shareholders equity 
instead  comprehensive income must be presented in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income which contains two sections  net income and other comprehensive income  or in two separate but consecutive statements 
asu was effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  with early adoption permitted 
in december  the fasb issued asu deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
this accounting update stated that the specific requirement to present items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income alongside their respective components of net income and other comprehensive income will be deferred 
in february  the fasb issued asu reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
this accounting update requires companies to present the effects on the line items of net income of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income if the amount being reclassified is required under us generally accepted accounting principles to be reclassified in its entirety to net income in the same reporting period 
asu is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of the amended guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topics asu which provides authoritative guidance on testing goodwill for impairment that will become effective beginning january   with earlier adoption permitted 
the revised standard is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities an option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
under asu  an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the amendments include a number of events and circumstances for an entity to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment 
the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in july  the fasb provided further guidance pertaining to the testing of goodwill for impairment with the issuance of accounting standards update no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topics asu 
the new guidance gives the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative valuation test 
we adopted this accounting standard in the fourth quarter of fiscal and this adoption did not have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk like virtually all commercial enterprises  we can be exposed to the risk market risk that the cash flows to be received or paid relating to certain financial instruments could change as a result of changes in interest rate  exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes 
our operations are not subject to risks of material foreign currency fluctuations  nor do we use derivative financial instruments in our investment practices 
we place our marketable investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards 
we do not expect material losses with respect to our investment portfolio or excessive exposure to market risks associated with interest rates 
the impact on our results of one percentage point change in short term interest rates would not have a material impact on our future earnings  fair value  or cash flows related to investments in cash equivalents or interest earning marketable securities 
current economic conditions may cause a decline in business and consumer spending which could adversely affect our business and financial performance including the collection of accounts receivables  realization of inventory and recoverability of assets 
in addition  our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by current and future economic conditions  including a reduction in the availability of credit  financial market volatility and recession
