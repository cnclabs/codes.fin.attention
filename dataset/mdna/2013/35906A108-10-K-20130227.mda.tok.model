critical accounting policies and estimates we review all significant estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and record the effect of any necessary adjustment prior to their publication 
uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements  accordingly  it is possible that actual results could differ from those estimates and changes to estimates could occur in the near term 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
estimates and judgments are used when accounting for revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  impairment of intangible assets  depreciation and amortization  pension and other postretirement benefits  income taxes  contingencies and purchase price allocations  among others 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to such estimates 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when services are provided or when products are delivered to customers 
revenue that is billed in advance includes monthly recurring network access services  special access services and monthly recurring local voice  features  long distance and inside wire charges 
the unearned portion of these fees is initially deferred as a component of other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet and recognized as revenue over the period that the services are provided 
revenue that is billed in arrears includes non recurring network access services  switched access services  non recurring local services and long distance services 
the earned but unbilled portion of these fees is recognized as revenue in our consolidated statements of operations and accrued in accounts receivable in the period that the services are provided 
excise taxes are recognized as a liability when billed 
installation fees and their related direct and incremental costs are initially deferred and recognized as revenue and expense over the average term of a customer relationship 
we recognize as current period expense the portion of installation costs that exceeds installation fee revenue 
we maintain an allowance for estimated bad debts based on our estimate of our ability to collect accounts receivable through a review of aging categories and specific customer accounts 
in and  we had no critical estimates related to bankruptcies of telecommunications companies or any other customers 
asset impairment we review long lived assets to be held and used  including customer lists  and long lived assets to be disposed of for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
recoverability of assets held for sale is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to their estimated fair market value 
if any assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value 
also  we periodically reassess the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets to determine whether any changes are required 
in and  we had no critical estimates related to asset impairments 
frontier communications corporation and subsidiaries intangibles our indefinite lived intangibles consist of goodwill and trade name  which resulted from the purchase of ilec properties 
we test for impairment of these assets annually  or more frequently  as circumstances warrant 
we test for goodwill impairment at the operating segment level  as that term is defined in us gaap 
effective with the third quarter of  the company reorganized into six operating segments in order to leverage the full benefits of its local engagement model 
the six operating segments consist of the following regions central  midwest  national  northeast  southeast and west 
our operating segments are aggregated into one reportable segment since they have similar economic characteristics 
in conjunction with the reorganization of our operating segments during the third quarter of  we reassigned goodwill to our reporting units using a relative fair value allocation approach 
this structure is consistent with how our chief operating decision makers ceo  cfo  president and coo review our results on a daily  weekly and monthly basis 
after making the change in our operating segments  we reviewed our goodwill impairment test by comparing the ebitda multiples for each reporting unit to their carrying values noting that no impairment indicator was present 
no potential impairment was indicated and no further analysis was deemed necessary 
our annual goodwill impairment testing date is december each of the operating segments is also a reporting unit 
the first step in the goodwill impairment test compares the carrying value of net assets of the reporting unit to its fair value 
the result of this first step indicated that fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of such reporting units 
as a result  the second step of the goodwill impairment test was not required 
goodwill by reporting unit operating segment at december  and is as follows reporting units in thousands northeast national southeast west central midwest goodwill enterprise values for rural ilec properties are typically quoted as a multiple of cash flow or ebitda 
marketplace company comparisons and analyst reports support a range of values around a multiple of to times annualized ebitda 
for the purpose of the goodwill impairment test we define ebitda as operating income  net of acquisition and integration costs  non cash pension opeb costs and severance costs  plus depreciation and amortization 
we determined the fair value estimates using times ebitda but also used lower ebitda multiples to gauge the sensitivity of the estimate and its effect on the margin of excess of fair value over the carrying values of the reporting units 
total fair value determined in this manner is then allocated to the reporting units based upon each unit s relative share of consolidated ebitda 
our method of determining fair value has been consistently applied for the three years ending december  the company monitors relevant circumstances  including general economic conditions  enterprise value ebitda multiples for rural ilec properties  the company s overall financial performance and the market prices for the company s common stock  and the potential impact that changes in such circumstances might have on the valuation of the company s goodwill or other intangible assets 
if our goodwill or other intangible assets are determined to be impaired in the future  we may be required to record a non cash charge to earnings during the period in which the impairment is determined 
effective with the first quarter of  the company reorganized into four operating segments consisting of the following regions east  central  national and west 
our operating segments are aggregated into one reportable segment 
depreciation and amortization the calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based upon the estimated useful lives of the underlying property  plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets 
depreciation expense is principally based on the composite group method for substantially all of our property  plant and equipment assets 
given the varying estimated useful lives of our property  plant and equipment assets  the company utilizes multiple asset categories with separately determined composite lives and individual depreciation rates for each asset category 
within the composite group method  we group individual assets  including cable and wire  into asset categories utilizing homogeneous characteristics  where such assets i are principally used in the same manner throughout the company  ii are subject to similar operating conditions and iii have similar estimated useful lives 
examples of the asset categories we utilize include aerial cable copper  aerial cable fiber  aerial cable station connections  underground cable copper and underground cable fiber 
as a result of continuing changes in technology  an independent study is conducted annually to update the estimated remaining useful lives of all individual asset categories 
the annual study includes models that consider actual usage  replacement history and certain assumptions about technology evolution to estimate the remaining useful lives of our asset base by asset category 
the latest study was completed in the fourth quarter of and after review and analysis of the results  we adopted new estimated remaining useful lives for certain plant assets as of october   with an immaterial impact to depreciation expense 
our composite depreciation rate for plant assets was as a result of this study 
there have been no significant changes to the ranges of estimated useful lives for the individual asset categories  including the cable and wire asset groups  during the three years ended december frontier communications corporation and subsidiaries our finite lived intangibles include intangible assets related to the customer base acquired in the transaction that were recorded at an estimated fair value of billion with an estimated useful life of nine years for the residential customer list  as distinguished from the years used for the business customer list 
for both classes of assets  the sum of the years digits method is used to amortize the intangible assets  which tracks more closely with the projected revenue stream of each asset class 
our frontier legacy customer list intangible assets did not distinguish between business and residential classes and the amortization period was five years on the straight line method 
we periodically reassess the useful life of our intangible assets to determine whether any changes to those lives are required 
we anticipate depreciation expense of approximately million to million and amortization expense of approximately million for pension and other postretirement benefits our estimates of pension expense  other postretirement benefits including retiree medical benefits and related liabilities are critical accounting estimates 
in connection with the completion of the transaction on july   certain employees were transferred from various verizon pension plans into pension plans that were then merged with the frontier communications pension plan the plan effective august  the asset transfers from verizon to the plan have been completed 
we sponsor a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering a significant number of our current and former frontier legacy employees and other postretirement benefit plans that provide medical  dental  life insurance and other benefits for covered retired employees and their beneficiaries and covered dependents 
all of the employees who are still accruing pension benefits are employees represented by unions 
the accounting results for pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions applied in the determination of such amounts 
these actuarial assumptions include the following discount rates  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  future compensation increases  employee turnover  healthcare cost trend rates  expected retirement age  optional form of benefit and mortality 
we review these assumptions for changes annually with our independent actuaries 
we consider our discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets to be our most critical assumptions 
the discount rate is used to value  on a present value basis  our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations opeb as of the balance sheet date 
the same rate is also used in the interest cost component of the pension and postretirement benefit cost determination for the following year 
the measurement date used in the selection of our discount rate is the balance sheet date 
our discount rate assumption is determined annually with assistance from our actuaries based on the pattern of expected future benefit payments and the prevailing rates available on long term  high quality corporate bonds that approximate the benefit obligation 
since the completion of the transaction on july   we have focused on integrating the operations and converging the processes of the acquired business to effectively operate as one business 
during the past two years  we have worked with verizon and our third party actuaries to merge the plans  finalize the transfer of plan assets and ensure we have all the information necessary to make well informed decisions 
based on the underlying changes in demographics and cash flows  we amended the estimation techniques regarding its actuarial assumptions  where appropriate  across all of our pension and postretirement plans 
the most significant of such changes was in the estimation technique utilized to develop the discount rate for its pension and postretirement benefit plans 
the revised estimation technique is based upon a settlement model bond link of such liabilities as of december  that permits us to more closely match cash flows to the expected payments to participants than would be possible with the previously used yield curve model 
we believe such a change results in an estimate of the discount rate that more accurately reflects the settlement value for plan obligations than the different yield curve methodologies used in prior years  as it provides the ability to review the quality and diversification of the portfolio to select the bond issues that would settle the obligation in an optimal manner 
this rate can change from year to year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields 
frontier communications corporation and subsidiaries in determining the discount rate as of december  and  we considered  among other things  the yields on the citigroup above median pension curve  the towers watson index  the general movement of interest rates and the changes in those rates from one period to the next 
as a result of the change described above  frontier is utilizing a discount rate of as of december  for its qualified pension plan  compared to rates of and in and  respectively 
the discount rate using the previous estimation technique would have been  resulting in an immaterial impact to the projected benefit obligation at december  in comparison to the discount rate 
the discount rate for postretirement plans as of december  was a range of to compared to a range of to in and in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is applied in the determination of periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost as a reduction in the computation of the expense 
in developing the expected long term rate of return assumption  we considered published surveys of expected market returns  and year actual returns of various major indices  and our own historical year  year and year investment returns 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of to in fixed income securities  to in equity securities and to in alternative investments 
we review our asset allocation at least annually and make changes when considered appropriate 
our asset return assumption is made at the beginning of our fiscal year 
in  and  our expected long term rate of return on plan assets was  and  respectively 
our actual return on plan assets in was 
for  we will assume a rate of return of 
our pension plan assets are valued at fair value as of the measurement date 
we expect that our pension and other postretirement benefit expenses for will be approximately million to million before amounts capitalized into the cost of capital expenditures 
in  they were million before amounts capitalized into the cost of capital expenditures 
we expect to make contributions to our pension plan of approximately million in we made net contributions to our pension plan of million in  consisting of cash payments of million and million during the third and fourth quarter of  respectively 
we made contributions to our pension plan of million in  consisting of cash payments of million and the contribution of real property with a fair value of million

historical financial and operating data presented for frontier is not indicative of future results and includes the results of operations of the acquired business from the date of acquisition on july  the financial discussion and tables below include a comparative analysis of our results of operations on a historical basis for our frontier operations as of and for the years ended december   and  which includes the results of operations of the acquired business for the years ended december  and  and the six months ended december  the variance explanations discussed below for the years ended december  and include a separate amount for the additional six months of revenue and operating expenses related to the operating results of the acquired business in certain analyses of revenue and operating expenses may refer to the results of the frontier legacy operations  which excludes the acquired business 
revenue revenue is generated primarily through the provision of local  network access  long distance  data  video and internet services 
such revenues are generated through either a monthly recurring fee or a fee based on usage and revenue recognition is not dependent upon significant judgments by management  with the exception of a determination of a provision for uncollectible amounts 
revenue for decreased million  or  to  million as compared to this decline in is primarily the result of decreases in the number of business and residential customers and switched access revenue  partially offset by an increase in subsidies revenue  each as described in more detail below 
switched access and subsidy revenue of million represented of our revenues for switched access revenue was million for  or of our revenues  as compared to million for  or of our revenues 
subsidy revenue was million in  or of our revenues  as compared to million in  or of our revenues 
we expect switched access and subsidy revenue to decline in revenue for increased  million  or  to  million as compared to excluding the additional six months of revenue of  million attributable to the acquired business  our revenue for decreased million  or  as compared to this decline in was a result of decreases in the number of business and residential customers  switched access  video and other revenue  partially offset by a million  or  increase in data and internet services revenue  each as described in more detail below 
the number of our access lines is one metric that has been used to understand our revenue and profitability 
access lines  however  have become less relevant given our strategic focus on customer retention and broadband penetration 
traditionally  we lose access lines because of competition  economic conditions  and by the loss of second lines upon the addition of broadband service 
an additional factor was introduced at the end of the second quarter of when frontier began selling simply broadband  which is our broadband service without any wireline circuit switched voice capabilities 
we are attracting and retaining customers with this product  and it has had a positive impact on our residential customer counts and revenues 
as a result  when selling this service to acquire or retain customers  no access lines are sold nor are they counted 
similarly  during the fourth quarter of  frontier began selling a satellite broadband product and we are trialing an at t mobility product bundled with broadband service in selected markets 
in both of these cases  a wireline voice capability may not be included and accordingly  in that situation  an access line will not be counted 
in addition  in our normal course of business  we proactively remove access lines when we upgrade business customers from multiple circuit switched lines and replace them with data facilities that can be used for voice services via voip 
as a result of all of the above  changes in access lines are not necessarily an indication of a loss of revenue or customers 
during  we lost  customers  as compared to a loss of  customers in we believe the improved customer retention in as compared to is principally due to our investments in our network  our local engagement strategy  improved customer service and the introduction of our simply broadband product 
also  during  the average monthly total customer revenue per customer increased  or  over we lost  residential customers and  business customers during the year ended december   or on an annual basis  as compared to  residential customers and  business customers lost during the year ended december   or on an annual basis 
average monthly residential revenue per customer increased to during as compared to this increase is due to the additional monthly subscriber line charges to our residential customers which were implemented in the third quarter of  as permitted by the order  increased penetration of products and rationalized product pricing 
economic conditions and or increasing competition could make it more difficult to sell our bundled service offerings  and cause us to increase our promotions and or lower our prices for our products and services  which would adversely affect our revenue  profitability and cash flows 
frontier communications corporation and subsidiaries during the year ended december   the company added  net broadband subscribers 
during  the company added  net broadband subscribers 
we believe that the lower customer activations were due to the final systems conversion during and the delayed roll out of marketing promotions in the second half of the company plans to significantly expand broadband availability and speed over the next several years 
we expect to continue to increase broadband subscribers in as stated above  while the number of access lines is one metric to gauge certain revenue trends  it is not necessarily the best or only measure to evaluate our business 
management believes that customer counts and understanding different components of revenue is most important 
for this reason  presented in the table titled other financial and operating data below is an analysis that presents customer counts  average monthly revenue  products per customer and churn 
it also categorizes revenue into customer revenue business and residential and regulatory revenue switched access and subsidy revenue 
despite the decline in residential customers and the decline in business customers during  customer revenue all revenue except switched access and subsidy revenue declined in by only percent as compared to the prior year 
the decline in customers was partially offset by increased penetration of additional products sold to both business and residential customers  which has increased our average monthly revenue per customer 
a substantial further loss of customers  combined with increased competition and the other factors discussed herein  may cause our revenue  profitability and cash flows to decrease in other financial and operating data as of increase as of increase as of december  decrease december  decrease december  customers broadband subscribers video subscribers dish and fios directv total video subscribers for the year ended december  increase increase increase increase decrease decrease decrease decrease revenue in s business residential customer revenue switched access and subsidy total revenue switched access minutes of use in millions average monthly total revenue per customer average monthly total customer revenue per customer as of or for the as of or for the as of or for the year ended increase year ended increase year ended december  decrease december  decrease december  business customer metrics customers revenue in s average monthly business revenue per customer residential customer metrics customers revenue in s average monthly residential revenue per customer customer monthly churn decline in video subscribers is due to the loss of  directv subscribers in the third quarter of as frontier no longer provides directv as part of its bundled packages

switched access and subsidy switched access and subsidy revenue for decreased million  or  to million  as compared with switched access revenue for of million  decreased million  or  as compared to  primarily due to the impact of a decline in minutes of use related to access line losses and the displacement of minutes of use by wireless  email and other communications services combined with a reduction due to the second half impact of the lower rates enacted by the first phase of the fcc s intercarrier compensation reform 
switched access and subsidy revenue includes subsidy payments we receive from federal and state agencies  including surcharges billed to customers that are remitted to universal service administrators 
subsidy revenue  including surcharges billed to customers of million for  of million  increased million  or  as compared with  primarily due to an increase in the customer surcharge revenue to support the federal universal service fund and increased recovery from the federal fund due to the implementation of the order during the second half of we expect a further decline in switched access and subsidy revenue in switched access and subsidy revenue for increased million  or  to million  as compared with switched access and subsidy revenue increased million as a result of the additional six months of revenue in attributable to the acquired business

subsidy revenue  excluding the additional six months of revenue related to the acquired business  for of million  decreased million  or  as compared with  primarily due to decreased support for local switching  the federal universal service fund and the federal high cost fund 
federal and state subsidies and surcharges which are billed to customers and remitted to universal service administrators for the company were million  million and million  respectively  and million in total  or of our revenues  for the federal and state subsidy revenue for represents of our consolidated revenues 
total federal and state subsidies and surcharges were million  or of our consolidated revenues  for and million  or of our consolidated revenues for on november   the fcc released a report and order and further notice of proposed rulemaking on the subject of universal service fund and intercarrier compensation reform 
the order changed how federal subsidies will be calculated and disbursed  with these changes being phased in beginning in these changes transition the federal universal service high cost fund  which supports voice services in high cost areas  to the caf  which supports broadband deployment in high cost areas 
caf phase i  implemented in  provides for ongoing usf support for price cap carriers to be capped at the amount 
in addition  the fcc in caf phase i made available for price cap ilecs an additional million in incremental high cost broadband support to be used for broadband deployment to unserved areas 
frontier was eligible to receive million of the total million caf phase i interim support 
on july   frontier announced that it would accept all of the funding for which it is eligible 
on july   frontier formally notified the fcc and appropriate state commissions of its intent to accept those funds and identified the unserved locations to be served using the funds 
the million in incremental caf phase i support is expected to enable an incremental  households for broadband service and will be accounted for as contributions in aid of construction 
frontier is required to implement  spend and enable these  households no later than july  as of december   frontier has received million of the caf phase i support funds and has initially recorded as increases to cash and other liabilities in the balance sheet 
the fcc is currently considering the rules for distribution of incremental caf funding in frontier communications corporation and subsidiaries the order also makes changes to intercarrier compensation 
intercarrier compensation  which is the payment framework that governs how carriers compensate each other for the exchange of interstate traffic  will transition over a number of years  with the first step being implemented in july  to a near zero rate for terminating traffic by frontier will be able to recover a significant portion of those revenues through end user rates and other replacement support mechanisms 
effective december   the order required providers to pay interstate access rates for the termination of voip toll traffic 
on april   the fcc  in an order on reconsideration  specified that changes to originating access rates for voip traffic will not be implemented until july the order has been challenged by certain parties in court and certain parties have also petitioned the fcc to reconsider various aspects of the order 
with the initial implementation commencing in july  the second half of s impact was immaterial 
certain states also have their own open proceedings to address reform to intrastate access charges and other intercarrier compensation and state universal service funds 
in addition  we have been approached by  and or are involved in formal state proceedings with  various carriers seeking reductions in intrastate access rates in certain states 
although the fcc has pre empted state jurisdiction on certain access charges  many states are still considering moving forward with their proceedings 
we cannot predict when or how these matters will be decided or the effect on our subsidy or switched access revenues 
however  future reductions in our subsidy or switched access revenues may directly affect our profitability and cash flows as those regulatory revenues do not have an equal level of associated variable expenses

incremental overtime and other costs incurred in  resulting from seasonal storms  were approximately million greater than since closing the transaction  the company has been reducing its reliance on outside contractors and vendors by bringing work in house to employees 
while wages have increased  they have been more than offset by reduced outside services 
with the systems and network conversions completed  the company is focusing on simplifying its processes to reduce wage and non wage costs 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded severance costs of million related to the termination of employees in connection with the re engineering initiative 
we expect headcount to decline further in wage and benefit expenses for increased million  or  to  million as compared to wage and benefit expenses for increased million as a result of the additional six months of expenses in attributable to the acquired business 
wage and benefit expenses  excluding the additional six months of expenses related to the acquired business  decreased million  or  to million  as compared with  primarily due to lower costs for compensation and certain other benefits  including pension costs  as discussed below

frontier communications corporation and subsidiaries item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to ongoing investing and funding activities  including those associated with our pension assets 
market risk refers to the potential change in fair value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and equity prices 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
as a result  we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to market risks  and we are not party to any market risk management agreements other than in the normal course of business 
our primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk and equity price risk as follows interest rate exposure our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the interest bearing portion of our pension investment portfolio and related obligations  and floating rate indebtedness 
our long term debt as of december  was fixed rate debt with minimal exposure to interest rate changes 
we had no interest rate swap agreements related to our fixed rate debt in effect at december  and our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  all but million of our outstanding borrowings at december  have fixed interest rates 
in addition  our undrawn million revolving credit facility has interest rates that float with libor  as defined 
consequently  we have limited material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on our long term debt 
an adverse change in interest rates would increase the amount that we pay on our variable rate obligations and could result in fluctuations in the fair value of our fixed rate obligations 
based upon our overall interest rate exposure at december   a near term change in interest rates would not materially affect our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
sensitivity analysis of interest rate exposure at december   the fair value of our long term debt was estimated to be approximately billion  based on our overall weighted average borrowing rate of and our overall weighted average maturity of approximately years 
as of december   there has been no material change in the weighted average maturity applicable to our obligations since december  equity price exposure our exposure to market risks for changes in equity security prices as of december  is limited to our pension assets 
we have no other security investments of any material amount 
the company s pension plan assets have decreased from  million at december  to  million at december   a decrease of million 
this decrease is a result of benefit payments of million  primarily offset by million of positive investment returns including million of additional asset transfers from verizon and million of net cash contributions 
we made total net cash contributions to our pension plan for of million  which reflects the positive impact of funding rate changes contained in the highway investment act of and guidance from the irs on august  related to valuation rates  and on september  related to lump sum methodologies 
net contributions totaling million were made during the third quarter of and million was made in october we expect that we will make contributions to our pension plan of approximately million in frontier communications corporation and subsidiaries
