in march  we launched a new thought leadership platform called  the extended enterprise  which addresses enterprises growing need to securely collaborate with customers and business partners without discarding the protection provided by their own firewalls 
in conjunction with this thought leadership launch  we rebranded our solutions into two distinctive offerings called  intralinks connect and intralinks dealspace

in addition  we are able to simultaneously upgrade all of our customers with each new software release 
this enables us to focus our research and development expenditures on developing new features and functionality  rather than implementation 
our development process follows our own iterative methodology that includes elements of the agile and waterfall methodologies with multiple quality control cycles to ensure high quality and an on going update capability 
as of december   our research and development group consisted of employees based in new york  boston and various other locations 

table of contents our total product development cost  which includes product development expenses and capitalized software  was approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
competition the market for our solutions is highly competitive  fragmented and dynamic 
we compete with a multitude of service providers  including both virtual data room providers and enterprise software providers 
we expect to encounter increased competition from established software companies as well as newer entrants to the market for online content sharing services 
we believe that the principal differentiating factors in our market primarily include the ability to collaborate inside and outside firewalls while maintaining security  control  auditability and compliance standards 
we believe we compete effectively based on broad capabilities across all of these factors 
in particular  our solutions are specifically designed for inter enterprise collaboration for content and information sharing beyond the firewall 
our technology platform offers enterprise class scalability and reliability  while enabling secure  auditable and compliant information exchange  via a saas delivery model that lowers total cost of ownership 
additionally  our industry specific expertise  global customer support  scalability and reliability to ensure uninterrupted performance  as well as price and functionality  have earned us a reputation of trust with our customers 
intellectual property we rely on a combination of patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret laws in the united states and other jurisdictions  as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions  to protect our proprietary technology and our brand 
we have registered our intralinks trademark  as well as other trademarks  with the us patent and trademark office and in several jurisdictions outside the united states 
we hold seven issued united states patents patent numbers       and 
these patents  which are scheduled to expire on various dates commencing on february   cover  among other things  certain processes and systems for using a computer to upload documents to a server  permission any number of recipients to view or download documents and send an automated alert and link to those recipients 
our patents contemplate broad applications of these processes  including in the context of combination of such processes with single sign on technology  use of the process with handheld devices  combination of the process with data encryption and customized user interfaces for private labeling  use of the processes for managing time sensitive projects and tasks  and automatic updating of exchange contents at regular time intervals 
we have additional patents pending with the us patent and trademark office  including one that relates to certain aspects of the technology we developed to allow customers to filter access to documents based on a user self declared attributes 
in one application of this technology  investors in syndicated loans use it to facilitate compliance by shielding certain of their personnel from access to material non public information about corporate borrowers 
we will continue to assess appropriate occasions for seeking patent and other intellectual property protections for those aspects of our technology and service that we believe constitute innovations providing significant competitive advantages 
employees as of december   we employed full time employees  including in sales and marketing  in product development  in operations and support  and in general and administrative

item a risk factors the following risks and uncertainties  together with all other information in this annual report  including our consolidated financial statements and related notes  should be considered carefully 
any of the risk factors we describe below could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations  and could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate or decline 
risks related to our business and our industry continuing weakness or further deterioration in domestic and global economic conditions could have a significant adverse impact on our business  financial condition and operating results 
our business  financial condition and operating results could be significantly affected by general economic conditions 
the us and global economies have experienced a significant prolonged downturn and prospects for sustained economic recovery remain uncertain 
in particular  the european union continues to face significant economic challenges  which could impede the recovery of the worldwide economy 
prolonged economic weakness or a further downturn in the us and global economies could result in a variety of risks to our business 
to the extent that economic conditions remain uncertain or deteriorate further  our business and operating results could be significantly and adversely affected 

table of contents our future profitability is uncertain 
we have historically incurred significant net operating losses 
as a result of these operating losses  we accumulated a deficit of million from june   the date on which  through a series of transactions we refer to as the merger  all of the outstanding equity of intralinks  inc was acquired by a newly formed entity  ta indigo holding corporation  which was owned by ta associates  inc now part of ta associates management  lp  rho capital partners  inc  a principal stockholder in intralinks  inc since  and other stockholders  including former and current officers and employees of intralinks  inc  through december  our future profitability depends on  among other things  our ability to generate revenue in excess of our expenses 
however  since our initial public offering in august  we have incurred and will continue to incur as a public company significant additional legal  accounting and other expenses to which we were not subject as a private company  including expenses related to our efforts in complying with the requirements of sarbanes oxley act of  or sarbanes oxley  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  or dodd frank  and other public company disclosure and corporate governance requirements  responding to requests of government regulators and defending the class action and stockholder derivative lawsuits filed against us 
at the same time  we have significant and continuing fixed costs relating to the maintenance of our assets and business  including our substantial debt service requirements  which we may not be able to reduce adequately to sustain our profitability if our revenue decreases 
our profitability also may be impacted by non cash charges such as stock based compensation charges and potential impairment of goodwill  which will negatively affect our reported financial results 
even if we achieve our profitability on an annual basis  we may not be able to achieve profitability on a quarterly basis 
you should not consider prior revenue growth as indicative of our future performance 
in fact  in future quarters we may not have any revenue growth and our revenue could decline 
we may continue to incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons  including the other risks described in this form k  and we may encounter unforeseen expenses  difficulties  complications  delays and other unknown events 
our failure to achieve and maintain our profitability could negatively impact the market price of our common stock 
we may be unable to sustain positive cash flow 
our ability to continue to generate positive cash flow depends on our ability to generate collections from sales in excess of our cash expenditures 
our collections from sales can be negatively affected by many factors  including but not limited to our inability to convince new customers to use our services or existing customers to renew their contracts or use additional services  the lengthening of our sales cycle  changes in our customer mix  a decision by any of our existing customers to cease or reduce using our services  failure of customers to pay our invoices on a timely basis or at all  a failure in the performance of our solutions or our internal controls that adversely affects our reputation or results in loss of business  the loss of market share to existing or new competitors  regional or global economic conditions affecting perceived need for or value of our services  or our inability to develop new products or expand our offerings on a timely basis and thus our potentially not meeting evolving market needs 
we anticipate that we will incur increased sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses as we continue to diversify our business into new industries and geographic markets 
our business will also require significant amounts of working capital to support our growth 
in addition  we face significant expenditures in connection with our public company disclosure  sarbanes oxley  and other corporate governance requirements  pending class action and stockholder derivative lawsuits and sec investigation involving us 
we may not achieve collections from sales to offset these anticipated expenditures sufficient to maintain positive future cash flow 
in addition  we may encounter unforeseen expenses  difficulties  complications  delays and other unknown events that cause our costs to exceed our expectations 
an inability to generate positive cash flow may decrease our long term viability 
our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations  or future borrowings under our credit facility or from other sources may not be available to us  in amounts sufficient to enable us to repay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs  including capital expenditure requirements 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate or obtain enough capital to service our debt and fund our planned capital expenditures and business plan 
we may be more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions than less leveraged competitors and thus less able to withstand competitive pressures 
any of these events could reduce our ability to generate cash available for investment or debt repayment or to make improvements or respond to events that would enhance profitability 
if we are unable to service or repay our debt when it becomes due  our lenders could seek to accelerate payment of all unpaid principal and foreclose 
table of contents on our assets  and we may have to take actions such as selling assets  seeking additional equity investments or reducing or delaying capital expenditures  strategic acquisitions  investments and alliances 
additionally  we may not be able to effect such actions  if necessary  on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
any such event would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our operating results are likely to fluctuate from quarter to quarter  which may have an impact on our stock price 
our operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future 
as a result  we may not be able to accurately forecast our revenues or operating results 
our operating results may fall below market analysts expectations in some future quarters  which could lead to downturns in the market price of our common stock 
quarterly fluctuations may result from factors such as changes in the markets that we serve  changes in demand for our services  rate of penetration within our existing customer base  loss of customers or business from one or more customers  including from consolidations and acquisitions of customers  increased competition  changes in the mix of customer types  changes in our standard service contracts that may affect when we recognize revenue  loss of key personnel  interruption in our service resulting in a loss of revenue  changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors  write offs affecting any of our material assets  changes in our operating expenses  customer credits issued in excess of established reserves  software bugs or other service quality problems  concerns relating to the security of our systems  and general economic conditions 
we believe that our quarterly operating results may vary significantly in the future  that period to period comparisons of results of operations may not necessarily be meaningful and  as a result  such comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
we have a substantial amount of debt that exposes us to risks that could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we had total indebtedness of million outstanding as of december  pursuant to our first lien credit agreement  entered into on june   as amended  or the first lien credit facility  which is secured by liens on substantially all of our assets 
the level and nature of our indebtedness could  among other things make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary financing in the future  limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business  reduce funds available for use in our operations and corporate development initiatives  impair our ability to incur additional debt because of financial and other restrictive covenants or the liens on our assets that secure our current debt  hinder our ability to raise equity capital  because in the event of a liquidation of our business  debt holders receive a priority before equity holders  make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business  and place us at a possible competitive disadvantage relative to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources 
in addition  we may incur significantly more debt in the future  which will increase each of the risks described above related to our indebtedness 
as of december   we had million available to us for additional borrowing under a million revolving credit facility 
if we increase our indebtedness by borrowing under our credit facility or incur other new indebtedness  each of the risks described above would increase 

table of contents failure to maintain the security and integrity of our systems  software and solutions could seriously damage our reputation and affect our ability to retain customers and attract new business 
maintaining the security and integrity of our systems  software and solutions is an issue of critical importance for us and for our customers and users who use our systems to store and exchange large volumes of proprietary and confidential information 
there appears to be an increasing number of individuals  governments  groups and computer hackers developing and deploying a variety of destructive software programs such as viruses  worms and other malicious software that could attack our computer systems or solutions or attempt to infiltrate our systems 
we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our systems  solutions and source code 
despite significant efforts to create security barriers  it is virtually impossible for us to mitigate this risk entirely because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target 
like all software solutions  our software is vulnerable to these types of attacks 
an attack of this type could disrupt the proper functioning of our software solutions  cause errors in the output of our customers work  allow unauthorized access to sensitive  proprietary or confidential information of ours or our customers and other destructive outcomes 
if an actual or perceived breach of our security were to occur  our reputation could suffer  customers could stop buying our solutions  we could face lawsuits and potential liability and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 
there is also a danger of industrial espionage  cyber attacks  misuse or theft of information or assets including source code  or damage to assets by people who have gained unauthorized access to our facilities  systems or information  which could lead to the disclosure of portions of our source code or other confidential information  improper usage and distribution of our solutions without compensation  illegal usage of our solutions  the putting in jeopardy of the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems  manipulation and destruction of data  defects in our software and downtime issues 
although we actively employ measures to combat unlicensed copying  access and use of our software and intellectual property through a variety of techniques  preventing unauthorized use or infringement of our rights is inherently difficult 
the occurrence of an event of this nature could adversely affect our financial results or could result in significant claims against us for damages 
further  participating in either a lawsuit to protect against unauthorized access to  usage of or disclosure of any of our solutions or any portion of our source code or the prosecution of an individual in connection with a cybersecurity breach could be costly and time consuming and could divert management attention and adversely affect the market perception of us and our solutions 
a number of core processes  such as software development  sales and marketing  customer service and financial transactions  rely on our it infrastructure and applications 
malicious software  sabotage and other cybersecurity breaches of the types described above could cause an outage of our infrastructure  which could lead to a substantial denial of service and ultimately downtimes  recovery costs and customer claims 
this could have a significant negative impact on our business  financial position  profit or cash flows 
we rely upon our customers and users of our solutions to perform important activities relating to the security of the data maintained on our intralinks platform  such as assignment of user access rights and administration of document access controls 
because we do not control the access provided by our customers to third parties with respect to the data on our systems  we cannot ensure the complete integrity or security of this data 
errors or wrongdoing by users resulting in security breaches could be attributed to us 
because many of our engagements involve business critical projects for financial institutions and their customers and for other types of customers where confidentiality is of paramount importance  a failure or inability to meet our customers expectations with respect to security and confidentiality could seriously damage our reputation and affect our ability to retain customers and attract new business 
the security and integrity of our systems could also be jeopardized by a breach of our internal controls and policies by our employees  consultants or subcontractors having access to our systems 
if our systems fail or are breached as a result of a third party attack or an error  violation of internal controls or policies or a breach of contract by an employee  consultant or subcontractor that results in the unauthorized disclosure of proprietary or confidential information or customer data  we could lose business  suffer irreparable damage to our reputation  and incur significant costs and expenses relating to the investigation and possible litigation of claims relating to such event 
we could be liable for damages  penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations and costs for remediation and efforts to prevent future occurrences  any of which liabilities could be significant 
there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim 
we also cannot assure that our existing general liability insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims  or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim 
the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage  or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies  including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co insurance requirements  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  litigation  regardless of its outcome  could result in a substantial cost to us and divert management attention from our operations 
any significant claim or litigation against us could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we have implemented a number of measures designed to ensure the security of our information  it resources and other assets 
nonetheless  unauthorized users could gain access to our systems through cyber attacks and steal  use without authorization and sabotage our intellectual property and confidential data 
any breach of our it security  misuse or theft could lead to loss of production  recovery costs or litigation brought by customers or business partners  cash flows and reputation 
our ability to provide our services may be adversely impacted by disruptions to our hardware and software systems 
our services are highly dependent on our computer and telecommunications equipment and software systems 
disruptions in our service and related software systems could be the result of errors or acts by our vendors  customers  users or other third parties  or electronic or physical attacks by persons seeking to disrupt our operations 
any damage to  or failure or capacity limitations of  our systems and our related network could result in interruptions in our service that could cause us to lose revenue or issue credits or refunds or could cause our customers to terminate their subscriptions  in each case adversely affecting our renewal rates 
our business and reputation will be adversely affected if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable 
our business depends substantially on customers renewing and expanding their subscriptions for our services 
any decline in our customer renewals and expansions would harm our future operating results 
we enter into subscription agreements with certain of our customers that are generally one year in length 
as a result  maintaining the renewal rate of our subscription agreements is critical to our future success 
contracts with annual commitment terms typically contain an automatic renewal clause  however  our customer agreements typically include a provision permitting the customer to provide notification of non renewal within to days prior to the end of the contract term 
repeat customers who do not have automatic renewal terms typically negotiate renewal terms at or prior to each annual termination date 
our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of the initial term of their agreements and some of our customers have elected not to do so 
we cannot assure you that any of our customer agreements will be renewed 
the loss of any customers that individually or collectively account for a significant amount of our revenues would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
our renewal rates may decline due to a variety of factors  including the price  performance and functionality of our solutions  the availability  price  performance and functionality of competing products and services  our ability to demonstrate to new customers the value of our solutions within the initial term  the relative ease and low cost of moving to a competing product or service  consolidation in our customer base  the effects of economic downturns  including the current global economic recession  and global economic conditions  reductions in our customers spending levels  or our customers ceasing to use or anticipating a declining need for our services in their operations 
if our renewal rates are lower than anticipated or decline for any reason  or if customers renew on terms less favorable to us  our revenue may decrease and our profitability and gross margin may be harmed  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from contracts that provide for the use of our solutions for a fixed duration 
our inability to enter into new contracts as existing ones expire could negatively impact our overall financial performance 
many of our contracts with customers are entered into in connection with discrete one time financial and strategic business transactions and projects such as m a transactions 
during the fiscal years ended december   and  revenues generated from transactional contracts constituted a substantial portion of our total revenues 
these transactional agreements typically have initial terms of six to twelve months depending on the purpose of the intralinks exchange 
accordingly  our business depends on our ability to replace these transactional agreements as they expire 
our inability to enter into new contracts with existing customers or find new customers to replace these contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
a significant part of our business is derived from the use of our solutions in connection with financial and strategic business transactions 
if the volume of these transactions does not increase  demand for our services may not grow and could decline 
a significant portion of our revenue depends on the purchase of our services by parties involved in financial and strategic business transactions such as mergers and acquisitions  or m a  loan syndications and other debt capital markets  or dcm  transactions 

table of contents during the fiscal years ended december   and  revenues generated from the m a and dcm principal markets constituted approximately  and  respectively  of our total revenues 
if the volume of these types of transactions does not increase  demand for our services may not grow and could decline 
the credit crisis  deterioration of global economies  rising unemployment and reduced equity valuations all create risks that could harm our business 
we are not able to predict the impact any potential worsening of macroeconomic conditions could have on our results of operations 
the level of activity in the financial services industry  including the financial transactions our services are used to support  is sensitive to many factors beyond our control  including interest rates  regulatory policies  general economic conditions  our customers competitive environments  business trends  terrorism and political change 
unfavorable conditions or changes in any of these factors could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we face shareholder lawsuits and other potential liabilities that could materially adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have been  are currently and may in the future be the subject of various lawsuits  proceedings and investigations 
in december  we and certain of our current and former officers and directors were named as defendants in class action and stockholder derivative lawsuits 
in addition  in august  we received a subpoena from the sec requesting certain documents related to our business from january  through august  see item legal proceedings for more information about these matters 
given the stage of these lawsuits and the nature of the sec investigation  we are unable to assess or quantify with any certainty their outcome  timing or potential costs 
in defending and ultimately resolving these matters  we may be required to pay substantial amounts  divert management attention from the operation of our business or change our business practices  any of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and  consequently  the trading price of our common stock 
the outcome and amount of resources needed to defend or resolve lawsuits or regulatory actions  and respond to regulatory requests  is unpredictable and may remain unknown for long periods of time 
the sec may choose to expand the scope of its investigation or initiate an enforcement action to bring charges against us 
in addition  the plaintiffs and the sec  if an enforcement action is initiated  may seek recovery of very large damage awards  substantial fines or significant restrictions on our business 
our exposure under these matters will also include our indemnification obligations  to the extent we have any  to current and former officers and directors against losses incurred in connection these matters  including reimbursement of legal fees 
although we maintain insurance for claims of this nature  our insurance coverage does not apply in all circumstances and may be denied or insufficient to cover the costs related to the class action and stockholder derivative lawsuits and sec investigation 
in addition  these matters or future lawsuits or investigations involving us may increase our insurance premiums  deductibles or co insurance requirements or otherwise make it more difficult for us to maintain or obtain adequate insurance coverage on acceptable terms  if at all 
moreover  adverse publicity associated with regulatory actions and investigations and negative developments in pending legal proceedings could decrease customer demand for our services 
as a result  the pending lawsuits and sec investigation and any future lawsuits or investigations involving us or our officers or directors could have a material adverse effect on our business  reputation  financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and the trading price of our common stock 
changes in laws  regulations or governmental policy applicable to our customers or potential customers may decrease the demand for our solutions or increase our costs 
the level of our customers and potential customers activity in the business processes our services are used to support is sensitive to many factors beyond our control  including governmental regulation and regulatory policies 
many of our customers and potential customers in the life sciences  energy  utilities  insurance  financial and other industries are subject to substantial regulation and may be the subject of further regulation in the future 
accordingly  significant new laws or regulations or changes in  or repeals of  existing laws  regulations or governmental policy may change the way these customers do business and could cause the demand for and sales of our solutions to decrease 
for example  many products developed by our customers in the life sciences industry require approval of the us food and drug administration  or fda  and other similar foreign regulatory agencies before they can market their products 
the processes for filing and obtaining fda approval to market these products are guided by specific protocols that our services help support  such as us cfr part  which provides the criteria for acceptance by the fda of electronic records 
if new government regulations from future legislation or administrative action or from changes in fda or foreign regulatory policies occur in the future  the services we currently provide may no longer support these life science processes and protocols  and we may lose customers in the life sciences industry 
any change in the scope of applicable regulations that either decreases the volume of transactions that our customers or potential customers enter into or otherwise negatively impacts their use of our solutions would have a material adverse effect on our revenues or gross margins 
moreover  complying with increased or changed regulations could cause our operating expenses to increase as we may have to reconfigure our existing services or develop new services to adapt to new regulatory rules and policies  either of which will require additional expense and time 
additionally  the information provided by  or residing in  the software or services we provide to our customers could be deemed relevant to a regulatory investigation or other governmental or private legal proceeding involving our customers  which 
table of contents could result in requests for information from us that could be expensive and time consuming for us to address or harm our reputation since our customers rely on us to protect the confidentiality of their information 
these types of changes could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we are unable to increase our penetration in our existing principal markets  develop  market and sell new solutions and expand into additional markets  we will be unable to grow our business and increase our revenue 
we currently market our solutions for a wide range of business processes 
these include clinical trial management  safety information exchange and drug development and licensing for the life sciences industry  private equity fundraising and investor reporting  energy exploration and production ventures for the oil and gas industry  loan syndication and other debt capital markets transactions  due diligence for mergers and acquisitions  public offerings and other strategic transactions  contract and vendor management  and board reporting 
we intend to continue to focus our sales and marketing efforts in these markets to grow our business 
in addition  we believe our future growth depends not only on increasing our penetration into the principal markets in which our services are currently used  but also on identifying and expanding the number of industries  communities and markets that use or could use our services and expanding the solutions we offer to customers in those markets 
efforts to expand our service offerings beyond the markets that we currently serve or to develop  market and sell new product offerings  however  may divert management resources from existing operations  expose us to increased competition from new and existing competitors and require us to commit significant financial resources to an unproven business  either of which could significantly impair our operating results 
moreover  efforts to expand beyond our existing markets and solutions may never result in new services that achieve market acceptance  create additional revenue or become profitable 
our inability to further penetrate our existing markets  successfully launch new solutions or identify additional markets and achieve acceptance of our services in these additional markets could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we are unable to maintain or expand our direct sales capabilities  we may not be able to generate anticipated revenues 
we rely primarily on our direct sales force to sell our services 
our services and solutions require a sophisticated sales effort targeted at the senior management of our prospective customers 
we must expand our sales efforts to generate increased revenue from new customers 
failure to hire or retain qualified sales personnel will preclude us from expanding our business and generating anticipated revenue 
competition for talented sales personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our existing sales personnel or attract  assimilate or retain enough highly qualified sales personnel 
many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have 
if any of our sales representatives or sales management personnel were to leave us and join one of our competitors  we may be unable to prevent those sales representatives from helping our competitors solicit business from our existing customers  which could adversely affect our revenue 
in addition  in making employment decisions  particularly in the software industry  job candidates often consider the value of the stock options they are to receive in connection with their employment 
we have experienced and may continue to experience a substantial decline in the trading price of our stock 
accordingly  if the price of our stock is subject to a lengthy period of continued decline or significant volatility  our ability to attract or retain key employees could be materially impaired 
in the past  our sales force has experienced high turnover rates 
new hires require training and take time to achieve full productivity 
if we experience high turnover in our sales force in the future  we cannot be certain that new hires will become as productive as necessary to maintain or increase our revenue 
our performance depends on customer referrals from financial institutions and other users of our services 
we depend on end users of our solutions to generate customer referrals for our services 
we depend in part on the financial institutions  legal providers and other third parties who use our services to recommend them to a larger customer base than we can reach through our direct sales and internal marketing efforts 
for instance  a significant portion of our revenues from the m a sector business is derived from referrals by investment banks  financial advisors and law firms that have relied on our services in connection with prior transactions 
these referrals are an important source of new customers for our services and generally are made without expectation of compensation 
we intend to continue to focus our marketing efforts on these referral partners in order to expand our reach and improve the efficiency of our sales efforts 
the willingness of these users to provide referrals depends on a number of factors  including the performance  ease of use  reliability  reputation and cost effectiveness of our services as compared to those offered by our competitors 
we may not be able to maintain strong relationships with these financial institutions or professional advisors 
the loss of any of our significant referral sources or a decline in the number of referrals we receive could require us to devote substantially more resources to the sales and marketing of our services  which would increase our costs  potentially lead to a decline in our revenue  slow our growth and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the revenue we generate from our referral relationships may vary from period to period 

table of contents we may lose sales opportunities if we do not successfully develop and maintain strategic relationships to sell and deliver our solutions 
in addition to generating customer referrals through third party users of our solutions  we intend to pursue relationships with other third parties such as technology and content providers and implementation partners 
identifying partners and negotiating and documenting relationships with them require significant time and resources  as does integrating third party content and technology 
some of the third parties with whom we have strategic relationships have entered and may continue to enter into strategic relationships with our competitors 
further  these third parties may have multiple strategic relationships and may not regard us as significant for their businesses 
as a result  they may terminate their respective relationships with us  pursue other partnerships or relationships  or attempt to develop or acquire services or solutions that compete with ours 
our strategic partners also may interfere with our ability to enter into other desirable strategic relationships 
if we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with these third parties on favorable economic terms  our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired  and our business  results of operations and financial condition would suffer 
even if we are successful  we cannot assure you that these relationships will result in increased revenue or customer usage of our solutions or that the economic terms of these relationships will not adversely affect our margins 
consolidation in the commercial and investment banking industries and other industries we serve could adversely impact our business by eliminating a number of our existing and potential customers 
there has been  and continues to be  merger  acquisition and consolidation activity among our customers 
mergers or consolidations of banks and financial institutions  in particular  have reduced and may continue to reduce the number of our customers and potential customers for our solutions  resulting in a smaller market for our services  which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 
in addition  it is possible that the larger institutions that result from mergers or consolidations could perform themselves some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide in the future 
a merger of two of our existing customers may also result in the merged entity deciding not to use our service or to purchase fewer of our services than the companies did separately or may result in the merged entity seeking pricing advantages or discounts using the leverage of its increased size 
if that were to occur  it could adversely impact our revenue  which in turn would adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we do not maintain the compatibility of our services with third party applications that our customers use in their business processes  demand for our services could decline 
our solutions can be used alongside a wide range of other systems such as email and enterprise software systems used by our customers in their businesses 
if we do not support the continued integration of our services with third party applications  including through the provision of application programming interfaces that enable data to be transferred readily between our services and third party applications  demand for our services could decline and we could lose sales 
we will also be required to make our services compatible with new or additional third party applications that are introduced to the markets that we serve 
we may not be successful in making our services compatible with these third party applications  which could reduce demand for our services 
in addition  prospective customers  especially large enterprise customers  may require heavily customized features and functions unique to their business processes 
if prospective customers require customized features or functions that we do not offer and that would be difficult for them to develop and integrate within our services  then the market for our services will be adversely affected 

table of contents we operate in highly competitive markets  which could make it more difficult for us to acquire and retain customers 
the market for online collaborative content workspaces is intensely competitive and rapidly changing  with relatively low barriers to entry 
we expect competition to increase from existing competitors as well as new and emerging market entrants 
in addition  as we expand our service offerings  we may face competition from new and existing competitors 
we compete primarily on product functionality  service levels  security and compliance characteristics  price and reputation 
our competitors include companies that provide online products that serve as document repositories or virtual data rooms together with other products or services that may result in those companies effectively selling these services at lower prices and creating downward pricing pressure for us 
some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources than we do and they may be able to devote greater resources to the development and improvement of their services than we can 
as a result  our competitors may be quicker at implementing technological changes and responding to customers changing needs 
in addition  if our competitors consolidate or our smaller competitors are acquired by other  larger competitors  they may be able to provide services comparable to ours at a lower price due to their size 
our competitors may also develop services or products that are superior to ours and their products or services may gain greater market acceptance than our services 
furthermore  our customers or their advisors  including investment banks and law firms  may acquire or develop their own technologies  such as client extranets  that could decrease the need for our services 
the arrival of new market entrants or the use of these internal technologies could reduce the demand for our services or cause us to reduce our pricing  resulting in a loss of revenue and adversely affecting our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the average sales price of our solutions may decrease  which may reduce our profitability 
the average sales price for our solutions may decline for a variety of reasons  including competitive pricing pressures  discounts we offer  a change in the mix of our solutions  anticipation of the introduction of new solutions or promotional programs 
competition continues to increase in the market for online collaborative content workspaces and we expect competition to further increase in the future  thereby leading to increased pricing pressures 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful maintaining our prices at levels that will allow us to maintain profitability 
failure to maintain our prices could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we fail to adapt our services to changes in technology or the marketplace  we could lose existing customers and fail to attract new business 
our customers and users regularly adopt new technologies and industry standards continue to evolve 
the introduction of products or services and the emergence of new industry standards can render our existing services obsolete and unmarketable in short periods of time 
we expect others to continue to develop  introduce new and enhance existing products and services  which will compete with our services 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to enhance our current services and to develop and introduce new services that keep pace with technological developments  emerging industry standards and the needs of our customers 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in cost effectively developing  marketing and selling new services or service enhancements that meet these changing demands  that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of these services  or that our new service and service enhancements will adequately meet the demands of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance 
our customers may adopt technologies that decrease the demand for our services  which could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our business 
we target large institutions such as commercial banks  investment banks and life sciences companies for many of our services and we depend on their continued need for our services 
however  over time  our customers or their advisors  such as law firms  may acquire  adopt or develop their own technologies  such as client extranets  that decrease the need for our solutions 
the use of these internal technologies could reduce the demand for our services  result in pricing pressures or cause a reduction in our revenue 
if we fail to manage these challenges adequately  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

table of contents government regulation of the internet and e commerce and of the international exchange of certain information is subject to possible unfavorable changes  and our failure to comply with applicable regulations could harm our business and operating results 
as internet commerce continues to evolve  increasing regulation by federal  state or foreign governments becomes more likely 
for example  we believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy 
further  laws and regulations applying to the solicitation  collection  processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers ability to use and share data  potentially reducing demand for our products and services 
in addition  taxation of products and services provided over the internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the internet may also be imposed 
any regulation imposing greater fees for internet use or restricting the exchange of information over the internet could result in reduced growth or a decline in the use of the internet and could diminish the viability of our internet based services  which could harm our business and operating results 
interruptions or delays in our service due to problems with our third party web hosting facilities or other third party service providers could adversely affect our business 
we rely on sungard availability services lp for the maintenance of the equipment running our solutions and software at geographically dispersed hosting facilities 
our agreement with sungard availability services lp  or sungard  expires on december  if we are unable to renew  extend or replace this contract  we may be unable to arrange for replacement services at a similar cost and in a timely manner  which could cause an interruption in our service 
we do not control the operation of these sungard facilities  each of which may be subject to damage or interruption from earthquakes  floods  fires  power loss  telecommunications failures or similar events 
these facilities may also be subject to break ins  sabotage  intentional acts of vandalism or similar misconduct 
despite precautions taken at these facilities  the occurrence of a natural disaster  cessation of operations by our third party web hosting provider or sungard decision to close a facility without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at any facility could result in lengthy interruptions in our service 
in addition  the failure by these facilities to provide our required data communications capacity could result in interruptions in our service 
our loan agreement contains operating and financial covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities 
as of december   we had approximately million of debt outstanding under our first lien credit facility  which has a maturity date of june  these borrowings are secured by substantially all of our assets  including our intellectual property 
our loan agreement restricts  among other things  our ability to incur additional indebtedness other than in the normal course of business  create liens  make capital expenditures  investments and acquisitions  sell assets  pay dividends or make distributions on and  in certain cases  repurchase our stock  or consolidate or merge with other entities 
in addition  our loan agreement has a change in control provision that provides that  upon the occurrence of a change in control  all credit facility commitments shall terminate and all loans shall become due and payable 
furthermore  our loan agreement requires us to meet specified minimum financial measurements 
the operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our loan agreement  as well as any future financing agreements that we may enter into  may restrict our ability to finance our operations  engage in business activities or expand or fully pursue our business strategies 
our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to meet those covenants 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our loan agreement  which could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness under our loan agreement to become immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit 
we might require additional capital to support business growth  and this capital might not be available 
we intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges  including the need to develop new services or enhance our existing services  enhance our operating infrastructure and acquire complementary businesses and technologies 
accordingly  we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds 
if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities  our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution  and any new equity securities we issue could have rights  preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock 
any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters  which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities  including potential acquisitions 
in addition  we may not be able to 
table of contents obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it  our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited 
further downgrades in our credit ratings may increase our borrowing costs  limit our ability to raise capital  cause our stock price to decline or reduce analyst coverage  any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business 
on may   standard poor rating services placed all of our credit ratings  including our bb corporate credit rating  on creditwatch with negative implications 
subsequently on august   the standard poor rating services lowered our corporate credit rating from bb to b with a stable outlook 
a further downgrade in our credit rating could adversely impact the interest rates on our first lien credit facility  which provides that at any time our corporate credit rating is at least b stable from moody and at least b stable from standard poor our eurodollar rate margin will be 
if our credit rating were to further decline  our eurodollar rate margin would increase to 
since investors  analysts and financial institutions often rely on credit ratings to assess a company creditworthiness and risk profile  make investment decisions and establish threshold requirements for investment guidelines  our ability to raise capital  stock price and analyst coverage could be negatively impacted by a further downgrade to our credit rating 
our growth may strain our management  information systems and resources 
our growth has placed  and may continue to place  a significant strain on our managerial  administrative  operational  financial and other resources 
we intend to expand our overall business  customer base  headcount and operations both domestically and internationally 
growing a global organization and managing a geographically dispersed workforce will require substantial management effort and significant additional investment in our infrastructure 
we will be required to continue to improve our information technology infrastructure  reporting systems and procedures  and operational and financial controls  as well as manage expanded operations in geographically distributed locations 
our expected additional growth will increase our costs  which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by offsetting expense reductions in the short term 
if we fail to manage our growth successfully we will be unable to execute our business plan successfully  which could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
expansion of our business internationally will subject us to additional economic and operational risks that could increase our costs and make it difficult for us to operate profitably 
one of our key growth strategies is to pursue international expansion 
international revenue accounted for approximately   and  of our revenue in  and  respectively 
the continued expansion of our international operations may require significant expenditure of financial and management resources and may result in increased administrative and compliance costs 
in addition  international expansion will increasingly subject us to the risks inherent in conducting business internationally  including anti corruption laws  such as the foreign corrupt practices act  the uk bribery act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials  and antitrust and competition regulations  among others  localization of our services  including translation into foreign languages and adaptation for local practices and regulatory requirements  difficulty in enforcing contractual provisions in local jurisdictions  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and increased difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  the effect of applicable foreign tax structures  including tax rates that may be higher than tax rates in the united states or taxes that may be duplicative of those imposed in the united states  tariffs and trade barriers  difficulties in managing and staffing international operations  general economic and political conditions in each country  inadequate intellectual property protection in foreign countries  increased insurance and employee costs associated with operating in foreign jurisdictions  dependence on certain third parties  including channel partners with whom we may not have extensive experience  and the difficulties in and increased expenses resulting from complying with a variety of foreign laws  regulations and trade standards  including data protection and privacy laws and labor laws that may or may not be in conflict with us law 

table of contents fluctuations in the exchange rate of foreign currencies could result in currency transaction losses  which could harm our operating results and financial condition 
we currently have foreign sales denominated in foreign currencies and may in the future have sales denominated in the currencies of additional countries 
any fluctuation in the exchange rate of these foreign currencies may positively or negatively affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
if there continues to be volatility in exchange rates for foreign currencies  we may continue to see fluctuations in our revenue and expenses  which may impact our operating results 
because we recognize revenue for our services ratably over the term of our customer agreements  downturns or upturns in the value of signed contracts will not be fully and immediately reflected in our operating results 
we offer our services primarily through fixed commitment contracts and recognize revenue ratably over the related service period  which typically ranges from six to twelve months 
as a result  some portion of the revenue we report in each quarter is revenue from contracts entered into during prior quarters 
consequently  a decline in signed contracts in any quarter will not be fully and immediately reflected in the revenue for that quarter  but will instead negatively affect our revenue in future quarters 
in addition  we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to offset this reduced revenue 
similarly  revenue attributable to an increase in contracts signed in a particular quarter will not be fully and immediately recognized  as revenue from new or renewed contracts is recognized ratably over the applicable service period 
because we incur sales commissions at the time of sale  we may not recognize revenues from some customers despite incurring considerable expense related to our sales processes 
timing differences of this nature could cause our margins and profitability to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
our offerings of new services or products may be subject to complex revenue recognition standards  which could materially affect our financial results 
as we introduce new services or products  revenue recognition could become increasingly complex and require additional analysis and judgment 
additionally  we may negotiate and revise terms and conditions of our contracts with customers and channel partners  which may also cause us to revise our revenue recognition policies 
as our arrangements with customers evolve  we may be required to defer a greater portion of revenue into future periods  which could materially and adversely affect our financial results 
the sales cycles for enterprise customers can be long and unpredictable  and require considerable time and expense  which may cause our operating results to fluctuate 
the timing of our revenue from sales to enterprise customers is difficult to predict 
these sales efforts require us to educate our customers about the use and benefit of our services  including the technical capabilities and potential cost savings to an organization 
enterprise customers typically undertake a significant evaluation process that has in the past resulted in a lengthy sales cycle  typically several months 
we spend substantial time  effort and money on our enterprise sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales 
if sales expected from a specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter or at all  our results could fall short of public expectations and our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
if we are unable to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting in the future  our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be materially impaired  which could harm our operating results  investors views of us and  as a result  the value of our common stock 
upon registration of our shares of common stock with the sec  we became subject to rules and regulations that require us to maintain the effectiveness of both disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting 
effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports  effectively prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud  our reputation and operating results would be harmed 
in addition  beginning with the annual report on form k for the year ended december   we became subject to the requirement to perform an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and obtain a report from our independent registered public accounting firm addressing the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
we reported a material weakness in  and could report a material weakness in the future 
we may not be able to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting in the future 
if we are not able to maintain adequate compliance with these requirements in future years  we may be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis or our independent registered public accounting firm may be unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  which could result in sec or other regulatory investigations or proceedings  violations of new york stock exchange listing rules and loss of investor confidence in the reliability 
table of contents of our financial statements  and  in turn  materially adversely affect our business  reputation  financial position  results of operations and the market price of our common stock 
in addition  we could be required to incur substantial accounting and auditing expense and significant management time in complying with these requirements  remediating any material weaknesses that may be identified in the future  or responding to any regulatory investigations or proceedings 
we rely on third party software and hardware to support our system and services and our business and reputation could suffer if these third party services fail to perform properly 
we rely on hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties to offer our service 
this hardware and software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could result in delays in the provisioning of our services  which could negatively affect our business until equivalent technology is either developed by us or  if available  is identified  obtained and integrated 
third party software underlying our services can contain undetected errors or bugs 
we may be forced to delay commercial release of our services until any discovered problems are corrected and  in some cases  may need to implement enhancements or modifications to correct errors that we do not detect until after deployment of our services 
in addition  problems with the third party software underlying our services could result in damage to our reputation  loss of or delayed revenue  loss of customers  warranty claims or litigation  loss of or delayed market acceptance of our services  and unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy errors 
our use of open source software could negatively affect our ability to sell our services and subject us to possible litigation 
a portion of the technologies licensed by us incorporates open source software  and we may incorporate open source software in the future 
open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses 
if we fail to comply with these licenses  we may be subject to certain conditions  including requirements that we offer any of our services that incorporate the open source software for no cost  that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon  incorporating or using the open source software and that we license those modifications or alterations under the terms of the particular open source license 
if an author or other third party that distributes those open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses  we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages  enjoined from the sale of those of our services that contained the open source software and required to comply with the foregoing conditions  which could disrupt the distribution and sale of some of our services 
if we are found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others  we could be required to redesign our services  pay significant royalties or enter into license agreements with third parties 
this may significantly increase our costs or adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 
a third party may assert that our technology or services violates its intellectual property rights 
in particular  as the number of products and services offered in our markets  as well as the number of related patents issued in the united states and elsewhere increase and the functionality of these products and services further overlap  we believe that infringement claims may arise 
any claims  regardless of their merit  could be expensive and time consuming to defend  force us to stop providing services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  require us to redesign our technology and services  divert management attention and other company resources  and require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies  which may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 

table of contents if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology and other rights  the value of our business and our competitive position may be impaired 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  our competitors could use our intellectual property to market products and services similar to ours  which could decrease demand for our services 
we rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws as well as third party nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
these protections may not be adequate to prevent our competitors from copying or reverse engineering our technology and services to create similar offerings 
the scope of patent protection  if any  we may obtain from our patent applications is difficult to predict and our patents may be found invalid  unenforceable or of insufficient scope to prevent competitors from offering similar services 
our competitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information  we require employees  consultants  advisors  subcontractors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements and maintain policies and procedures to limit access to our trade secrets and proprietary information 
these agreements and the other actions we take may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information from unauthorized use  misappropriation or disclosure 
further  existing copyright and patent laws may not provide adequate or meaningful protection in the event competitors independently develop technology  products or services similar to ours 
even if the laws governing intellectual property rights provide protection  we may have insufficient resources to take the legal actions necessary to protect our interests 
in addition  our intellectual property rights and interests may not be afforded the same protection under the laws of foreign countries as they are under the laws of the united states 
our success depends on our customers continued high speed access to the internet and the continued reliability of the internet infrastructure 
our future sales growth depends on our customers having high speed access to the internet  as well as the continued maintenance and development of the internet infrastructure 
the future delivery of our services will depend on third party internet service providers to expand high speed internet access  maintain a reliable network with the necessary speed  data capacity and security  and develop complementary products and services  including high speed modems  for providing reliable and timely internet access and services 
the success of our business depends directly on the continued accessibility  maintenance and improvement of the internet as a convenient means of customer interaction  as well as an efficient medium for the delivery and distribution of information among businesses and by businesses to their employees 
all of these factors are out of our control 
if for any reason the internet does not remain a widespread communications medium and commercial platform  the demand for our services would be significantly reduced  which would harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
to the extent that the internet continues to experience increased numbers of users  frequency of use or bandwidth requirements  the internet may become congested and be unable to support the demands placed on it  and its performance or reliability may decline 
any future internet outages or delays could adversely affect our ability to provide services to our customers  which could adversely affect our business 
we may not successfully develop or introduce new services or enhancements to our intralinks platform or our service offerings and  as a result  we may lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers and our revenues may suffer 
our ability to attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers will depend in large part on our ability to enhance and improve our existing intralinks platform and our service offerings and to introduce new functionality either by acquisition or internal development 
our operating results would suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our customers  are not appropriately timed with market opportunity  or are not effectively brought to market 
we have in the past experienced delays in the planned release dates of new features and upgrades and have discovered defects in new services after their introduction 
there can be no assurance that new services or upgrades will be released according to schedule or that  when released  they will not contain defects 
either of these situations could result in adverse publicity  loss of revenues  delay in market acceptance or claims by customers brought against us  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
moreover  upgrades and enhancements to our service offerings may require substantial investment and we have no assurance that our investments will prove successful 
if new innovations to our solutions do not become widely adopted by customers  we may not be able to justify the investments we have made 
if we are unable to develop  license or acquire new products or enhancements to existing services on a timely and cost effective basis  or if our new products or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
if we fail to develop our brand cost effectively  our business may suffer 
we believe that developing and maintaining awareness of the intralinks brand in a cost effective manner is critical to achieving 
table of contents widespread acceptance of our existing and future services and is an important element in attracting new customers 
furthermore  we believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market develops 
successful promotion of our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide reliable and useful services at competitive prices 
brand promotion and protection will also require protection and defense of our trademarks  service marks and trade dress  which may not be adequate to protect our investment in our brand or prevent competitors use of similar brands 
in the past  our efforts to build our brand have involved significant expense 
brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue  and even if they do  any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand 
if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand  or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand  we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand building efforts  and our business could suffer 
if we are unable to retain our key executives  we may not be able to implement our business strategy 
we rely on the expertise and experience of our senior management  especially our president and chief executive officer  ronald w 
hovsepian  as well as the other executive officers and key employees referenced in item of this form k 
although we have employment agreements with certain of our executive officers  none of them or any of our other management personnel is obligated to continue his or her employment with us 
we have no key man insurance on any members of our management team 
the loss of services of any key management personnel could make it more difficult to pursue our business goals successfully 
furthermore  recruiting and retaining qualified management personnel are critical to our growth plans 
we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among technology companies for experienced management personnel 
our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may be limited or disallowed by the internal revenue service 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of million  including million of windfall tax benefits attributable to equity compensation  to offset future taxable income  which expire in various years beginning in and continuing through  if not utilized 
if we were not to generate sufficient future taxable income  this would adversely affect our ability to utilize these net operating loss carryforwards 
in addition  under the internal revenue code  substantial changes in our ownership could limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income 
sections and of the internal revenue code impose limitations on a company ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes if a company experiences a more than percent ownership change over a three year period 
we believe that  as a result of our initial and follow on public offerings  or as a result of prior or future issuances of our capital stock  it is possible that such a change in our ownership could be deemed to occur 
if such a change in our ownership occurs  our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards in any future periods may be limited on an annual basis 
in addition  due to an administrative omission from certain prior year tax filings related to losses generated by intralinks ltd  our uk subsidiary  we proactively sought reasonable cause relief in from the possible disallowance or restriction of these net operating loss carryforwards from the internal revenue service irs 
as a result  the company is currently undergoing an audit by irs of its us federal income tax returns for the years ended december  through as of the filing of this document  we have received notices of proposed adjustments from the irs disallowing million of foreign branch losses on the basis that they constitute dual consolidated losses in the us  the irs is asserting that the company is not entitled to reasonable cause relief for late election filings 
the company disagrees with the irs proposed adjustments and has commenced an appeal 
in the event relief is not ultimately granted  we would no longer have the ability to use a significant portion of our net operating loss carryforwards 
in the current year and in future years in which we have taxable income  we would have to pay more taxes than if we were able to fully utilize our net operating loss carryforwards 
this could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
if we undertake business combinations and acquisitions  they may be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value or divert management attention 
we may support our growth through acquisitions of complementary businesses  services or technologies 
future acquisitions involve risks  such as challenges associated with integrating acquired technologies and operations of acquired companies  exposure to unforeseen liabilities  diversion of managerial resources from day to day operations  possible loss of key employees  customers and suppliers  misjudgment with respect to the value  return on investment or strategic fit of any acquired operations or assets  
table of contents higher than expected transaction costs  and additional dilution to our existing stockholders if we use our common stock as consideration for acquisitions 
as a result of these risks  we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of any acquisition 
if we are unsuccessful in completing or integrating acquisitions  we may be required to reevaluate our growth strategy 
future business combinations could involve the acquisition of significant intangible assets 
we may need to record write downs from future impairments of identified intangible assets and goodwill 
these accounting charges would reduce any future reported earnings or increase a reported loss 
in addition  we could use substantial portions of our available cash to pay the purchase price for acquisitions 
subject to the provisions of our existing indebtedness  it is possible that we could incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities as consideration for these acquisitions  which could cause our stockholders to suffer significant dilution 
we incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies  which could harm our operating results 
since our initial public offering in august  we have incurred and will continue to incur as a public company significant additional legal  accounting and other costs to which we were not subject to as a private company  including expenses related to our efforts in complying with sarbanes oxley  and other public company disclosure and corporate governance requirements  responding to requests of government regulators and defending the class action and stockholder derivative lawsuits filed against us 
our management and other personnel will continue to need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives 
we expect that these rules  regulations and proceedings may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage previously available 
as a result  it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers 
we may be required to collect sales and use taxes on the services we sell  this could subject us to liability for past sales and cause our future sales to decrease 
we currently collect  or plan to collect  sales or use tax on our services in fourteen states 
historically  we have not charged or collected value added tax on our services anywhere in the world 
we may lose sales or incur significant expenses should tax authorities in other jurisdictions where we do business be successful in imposing sales and use taxes  value added taxes or similar taxes on the services we provide 
a successful assertion by one or more tax authorities that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of our services could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales  including interest and penalty charges  and could discourage customers from purchasing our services and otherwise harm our business 
further  we may conclude based on our own review that our services may be subject to sales and use taxes in other jurisdictions where we do business 
under these circumstances  we may voluntarily disclose our estimated liability to the respective tax authorities and initiate activities to collect taxes going forward 
it is not clear that our services are subject to sales and use tax in certain jurisdictions 
states and certain municipalities in the united states  as well as countries outside the united states  have different rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes 
these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time and  in the future  our services may be subject to these taxes 
although our customer contracts typically provide that our customers are responsible for the payment of all taxes associated with the provision and use of our services  customers may decline to pay back taxes and may refuse responsibility for interest or penalties associated with those taxes 
in certain cases  we may elect not to request customers to pay back taxes 
if we are required to collect and pay back taxes and associated interest and penalties  and if our customers fail or refuse to reimburse us for all or a portion of these amounts  or if we elect not to seek payment of these amounts  we will incur unplanned expenses that may be substantial 
moreover  imposition of such taxes on our services going forward will effectively increase the cost of our services to our customers  and may adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers or gain new customers in jurisdictions in which such taxes are imposed 
any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation or financial condition 
catastrophic events may disrupt our business 
a natural disaster  telecommunications failure  power outage  cyber attack  war  terrorist attack  or other catastrophic event could cause us to suffer system interruptions  reputational harm  delays in product development  breaches of data security and loss of critical data 
an event of this nature could also prevent us from fulfilling customer orders or maintaining certain service level requirements  particularly in respect of our saas and hosted offerings 
while we have developed certain disaster recovery plans and maintain backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of these types of events  a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely 
table of contents affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and  as a result  our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
though we came through recent storms sandy and nemo without issue  this is still a risk investors should be aware of 
risks related to our common stock our stock price may fluctuate significantly 
the stock market  particularly in recent years  has experienced significant volatility  particularly with respect to technology stocks 
the volatility of technology stocks often does not relate to the operating performance of the companies themselves 
factors that could cause volatility in the market price of our common stock include market conditions affecting our customers businesses  including the level of activity in the mergers and acquisitions and syndicated loan markets  the loss of any major customers or the acquisition of new customers for our services  announcements of new services or functions by us or our competitors  developments concerning intellectual property rights  comments by securities analysts  including the publication of their estimates of our operating results  actual and anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  rumors relating to us or our competitors  developments relating to lawsuits and investigations involving us  actions of stockholders  including sales of shares by our directors and executive officers  additions or departures of key personnel  and developments concerning current or future strategic alliances or acquisitions 
these and other factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially  which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock 
in addition  volatility in the market price of our stock could subject us to securities class action litigation 
we are currently  and may in the future be  the subject of class action and stockholder derivative lawsuits that could require us to incur substantial costs defending such lawsuits and divert the time and attention of our management 
our principal stockholders could exercise significant control over our company 
as of december   our two largest stockholders beneficially owned  in the aggregate  shares representing approximately of our outstanding capital stock 
although we are not aware of any voting arrangements in place among these stockholders  if these stockholders were to choose to act together  as a result of their stock ownership  they would likely be able to influence our management and affairs 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company and might affect the market price of our common stock 
future sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline 
if our existing stockholders sell  or indicate an intent to sell  substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly 
as of december   we had  shares of common stock outstanding 
a relatively small number of our shareholders own large blocks of shares 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that public sales of these shares will have on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  shares subject to outstanding options under our equity incentive plans and shares reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans will become eligible for sale in the public market in the future  subject to certain legal and contractual limitations 
moreover  holders of approximately  shares of our common stock have the right to require us to register these shares under the securities act of  as amended  pursuant to a registration rights agreement 
if our existing stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  or if the public perceives that these types of sales could occur  this could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock  even if there is no relationship between these types of sales and the performance of our business 
provisions of delaware law  our charter documents and our loan agreement could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company  even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders  and could make it more difficult for stockholders to change management 
provisions of delaware law  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by laws and our loan 
table of contents agreement may discourage  delay or prevent a merger  acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable  including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares 
these provisions may also prevent or delay attempts by stockholders to replace or remove our current management or members of our board of directors 
these provisions include a classified board of directors  limitations on the removal of directors  advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations  the inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings  the ability of our board of directors to make  alter or repeal our amended and restated by laws  the authority of our board of directors to issue preferred stock with such terms as our board of directors may determine  and provisions in our loan agreement that may accelerate payment of our debt in a change in control 
the affirmative vote of the holders of at least of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote  and not less than of the outstanding shares of each class entitled to vote thereon as a class  is generally necessary to amend or repeal the above provisions that are contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation 
also  absent approval of our board of directors  our amended and restated by laws may only be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote 
in addition  we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which limits business combination transactions with stockholders of or more of our outstanding voting stock that our board of directors has not approved 
these provisions and other similar provisions make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to acquire us without negotiation 
these provisions may apply even if some stockholders may consider the transaction beneficial to them 
as a result  these provisions could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
these provisions might also discourage a potential acquisition proposal or tender offer  even if the acquisition proposal or tender offer is at a premium over the then current market price for our common stock 
we have never paid dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  any gains from an investment in our common stock will likely depend on whether the price of our common stock increases 
we have not paid dividends on any of our classes of capital stock to date and we currently intend to retain our future earnings  if any  to fund the development and growth of our business 
in addition  the terms of our outstanding indebtedness restrict our ability to pay dividends  and any future indebtedness that we may incur could preclude us from paying dividends 
as a result  capital appreciation  if any  of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future 
consequently  in the foreseeable future  you will likely only experience a gain from your investment in our common stock if the price of our common stock increases 
if equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock  the price of our common stock could decline 
the trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business 
we do not control these analysts 
we have been  and may in the future be  the subject of unfavorable commentary or termination of coverage by equity analysts 
the price of our common stock could decline as a result of any such negative commentary or termination of coverage

item legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business  we and our subsidiaries are subject to various claims  charges  disputes  litigation and regulatory inquiries and investigations 
these matters  if resolved adversely against us  may result in monetary damages  fines and penalties or require changes in our business practices 
we are not currently aware of any pending or threatened material claims  charges  disputes  litigation and regulatory inquiries and investigations except as follows securities class action 
on december   we became aware of a purported class action lawsuit filed in the us district court for the southern district of new york  or the sdny or the court  against us and certain of our current and former executive officers 
the complaint  or the wallace complaint  alleges that the defendants made false and misleading statements or omissions in violation of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the plaintiff seeks unspecified compensatory damages for the purported class of purchasers of our common stock during the period from february  through november   or the allegation period 
on december   a second purported class action complaint  which makes substantially the same claims as  and is related to  the wallace complaint  was filed in the sdny against us and certain of our current and former executive officers seeking similar unspecified compensatory damages for the allegation period 
on april   the court consolidated the actions and appointed plumbers and pipefitters national pension fund as lead plaintiff  and also appointed lead counsel in the consolidated action  or the consolidated class action 
on june   the lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint that  in addition to the original allegations made in the wallace complaint  alleges that we  certain of its current and former officers and directors  and the underwriters in our april  stock offering issued a registration statement and prospectus in connection with the offering that contained untrue statements of material fact or omitted material information required to be stated therein in violation of the securities act of  as amended 
the defendants filed their motions to dismiss the action on july  and  in response to the lead plaintiff opposition to the defendants motions filed on september   the defendants filed their replies to plaintiff opposition on october  defendants motions to dismiss have been fully briefed and are currently pending before the court 
we believe that these claims are without merit and intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously 
shareholder derivative actions 
on december   a shareholder derivative complaint was filed in the sdny against us and certain of our current and former directors 
the complaint  or the dixon action  alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by causing us to issue materially false and misleading statements about our business prospects  financial condition and performance during the same allegation period alleged in the wallace complaint 
on april   the court approved the parties stipulation agreeing to stay all proceedings in the dixon action  including discovery  until the court renders a decision on the defendants anticipated motion to dismiss the consolidated class action 
on april   a second shareholder derivative complaint  or the horbal action  was filed in the supreme court of the state of new york in new york county against us and certain of our current and former directors and officers 
the horbal action makes substantially the same claims as  and is related to  the dixon action 
on april   one of the director defendants removed the horbal action to the sdny  and on may   it was assigned to the same judge as in the dixon action 
on may   the plaintiff in the horbal action moved to remand the case to state court 
on june   defendant filed an opposition to remand  and the plaintiff filed a reply on june  plaintiff motion to remand has been fully briefed and is pending before the court

key accomplishments business strategy review during  management initiated a business strategy review to explore long term growth opportunities 
the objective was to assess the competitive environment  identify the most attractive market opportunities  define a product roadmap and further develop our execution strategy 
we have made significant progress in validating our market opportunities and aligning the company to effectively address them 
this strategy assessment reinforces our commitment to anticipate the changing needs of our customers  industry trends  and competitive forces 
we continued to make good progress against our business strategy with particular emphasis on improving mid market coverage and overall market share in our strategic transactions business 
we are pursuing geographies where we are underrepresented and that will provide us with promising market opportunities 
additionally  we have continued to enhance our product offerings with new capabilities and improved functionality 
operational changes during  management initiated a review of our systems and business processes and began making changes toward operational improvement 
we began a redesign of the sales model focused on improving marketing and demand generation  establishing a high velocity inside sales model  and moving toward sales specialization in our enterprise sales force 
we believe this sales model will better address opportunities in the market and better match sales with the way customers buy saas offerings 
in product development  we instituted a change in methodology  embracing agile and waterfall development methodologies 
we also put a program of intellectual property protection in place 
we also entered into a strategic partnership to help us with distribution and technology 
we are committed to seeking out and building crucial relationships that promote  sell and support our services 
key personnel our executive leadership team went through a significant amount of change in new additions to the team during the year included the general counsel  evp of business operations and cio  evp of sales and marketing and chief financial officer 
the executive leadership team is confident that we are well positioned to take full advantage of the opportunities that lie ahead and that the right people are on board to execute against them 
key metrics we evaluate our operating and financial performance using various performance indicators  as well as against the macroeconomic trends affecting the demand for our solutions in our principal markets 
we also monitor relevant industry performance  including transactional activity in the debt capital markets  or dcm  and the mergers and acquisitions  or m a  market globally  to provide insight into the success of our sales activities as compared to our peers and to estimate our market share in each of our principal markets 
our management relies on the key performance indicators set forth below to help us evaluate growth trends  establish budgets  measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and assess operational efficiencies 
we discuss revenue under results of operations  and cash flow provided by operating activities  including deferred revenue  under liquidity and capital resources 
other measures of our performance  including adjusted gross margin  adjusted operating income  adjusted net income  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin  and free cash flow are defined and discussed under non gaap financial measures below 

table of contents year ended december  consolidated statement of operations data total revenue non gaap gross margin non gaap adjusted operating income non gaap adjusted net income non gaap adjusted ebitda non gaap adjusted ebitda margin consolidated balance sheet data deferred revenue at december consolidated statement of cash flows data cash flows provided by operations free cash flow short term only non gaap financial measures this form k includes information about certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap or us gaap  including non gaap gross profit and gross margin  non gaap adjusted operating income and margin  non gaap adjusted net income  non gaap adjusted net income per share  non gaap adjusted ebitda and free cash flow 
these non gaap measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by gaap and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies 
management defines its non gaap financial measures as follows non gaap gross margin represents the corresponding gaap measure adjusted to exclude stock based compensation expense  and amortization of intangible assets 
non gaap adjusted operating income represents the corresponding gaap measure adjusted to exclude stock based compensation expense  amortization of intangible assets  impairment charges or asset write offs  and costs related to public stock offerings 
non gaap adjusted net income represents the corresponding gaap measure adjusted to exclude stock based compensation expense  amortization of intangible assets  impairment charges or asset write offs  costs related to debt repayments and costs related to public stock offerings 
non gaap adjusted net income is calculated using an estimated long term effective tax rate 
non gaap net income per share represents non gaap adjusted net income defined above divided by dilutive shares outstanding 
non gaap adjusted ebitda represents net loss income adjusted to exclude interest expense  income tax provision benefit  depreciation and amortization  amortization of intangible assets  stock based compensation expense  amortization of debt issuance costs  other expense income  net  impairment charges or asset write offs  and costs related to public stock offerings 
free cash flow represents cash flow from operations less capital expenditures 

table of contents management believes that these non gaap financial measures  when viewed with our results under us gaap and the accompanying reconciliations  provide useful information about our period over period growth and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating our operating performance and  internally  for managing the cash needs of our business 
additionally  management believes that these non gaap financial measures provide a more meaningful comparison of our operating results against those of other companies in our industry  as well as on a period to period basis  because these measures exclude items that are not representative of our operating performance  such as amortization of intangible assets  interest expense and fair value adjustments to the interest rate swap 
management believes that including these costs in our results of operations results in a lack of comparability between our operating results and those of our peers in the industry  the majority of which are not highly leveraged and do not have comparable amortization costs related to intangible assets 
however  non gaap gross margin  non gaap adjusted operating income  non gaap adjusted net income  non gaap adjusted net income per share  non gaap adjusted ebitda and free cash flow are not measures of financial performance under us gaap and  accordingly  should not be considered as alternatives to gross margin  operating income  net income loss  and cash flows provided by operations as indicators of operating performance

table of contents components of operating results sources of revenue we derive revenue principally through fixed commitment contracts under which we provide customers with various services  including access to our cloud based intralinks platform  access to one or more of our intralinks exchanges  the related customer support and other services 
our management operates the business in one reportable segment  assessing performance and making operating decisions based on one single operating unit 
however  to date we have monitored certain revenue metrics and trends by principal markets  as defined below 
we also monitor the mix of subscription and transaction customers within these markets  as well as revenue growth in international locations 
the following represent our principal markets enterprise comprises customers spanning a variety of industries  including financial services  pharmaceutical  biotechnology  consumer  energy  industrial  legal  insurance  real estate and technology  who use our services for a wide range of corporate purposes  primarily under subscription arrangements 
mergers acquisitions m a comprises customers  across the same variety of industries described above  who use intralinks exchanges for project based transactions  such as mergers  acquisitions and dispositions 
these customers are typically referred to us by financial or legal advisors involved in the respective transactions 
this principal market is generally characterized by the use of the intralinks platform under transaction arrangements 
debt capital markets dcm primarily comprises customers within the financial services industry who use intralinks exchanges for loan syndication and administration  and is generally characterized by the use of the intralinks platform under subscription arrangements 
we believe our revenue growth will be driven by our ongoing investments in our platform and in enhanced service offerings  by improving our mid market coverage  by expanding our focus on underrepresented geographies and by increasing our overall market share in our strategic transactions business 
we believe that making continued investments in our platform  services and operational infrastructure will allow us to service more clients  including those with larger scale requirements 
additionally  during the year ended december   we received insurance proceeds totaling million  as a result of one of our primary facilities sustaining water damage from a fire on a floor above  which resulted in an interruption in our operations 
we filed a claim under our business interruption insurance policy for lost revenue caused by the down time experienced subsequent to the loss event 
the business interruption insurance proceeds are classified as other revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 
cost of revenue cost of revenue primarily consists of i personnel related costs  including non cash stock based compensation  ii expenses for third party contractors providing customer support and project management services  iii expenses related to hosting our service  including internet connectivity  co location management and data storage fees  iv depreciation expenses for hardware  v amortization expenses associated with capitalized software and definite lived intangible assets and vi allocated overhead 
our hosting provider charges us a monthly fee based on the number of servers  the amount of storage and the levels of network connectivity required 
we allocate overhead  such as facilities and telecommunication charges  to all departments based on headcount  which we consider to be a fair and representative means of allocation 
as such  general overhead expenses are reflected in our cost of revenue and operating expenses categories 
we will continue to make investments in our platform and services  which may include direct investments in our technology  client services group and our hosting infrastructure 
the level and timing of investments in these areas could affect our cost of revenue  both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue 
gross profit and gross margin our gross profit and margin are driven by our ability to manage the costs of providing our service as revenue increases or decreases 
as noted under cost of revenue above  we intend to continue making investments in personnel  including our client service group  and other initiatives directly related to the development of our technology 

table of contents operating expenses product development product development expenses consist primarily of personnel related costs  including non cash stock based compensation  and consulting expenses associated with the design  development and testing of our systems 
we capitalize direct costs of services used in developing internal use software  including both internal and external direct labor costs 
costs incurred during the preliminary project stage  as well as maintenance and training costs  are expensed as incurred 
we expect that product development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we extend our service offerings and develop new technologies to ensure our service integrates and performs well with existing and future leading databases  applications  operating systems and other platforms  and keeps pace with technological change in our industry 
depending on the nature and levels of work undertaken  the amount of product development costs that are capitalized may fluctuate from period to period  which may affect operating expenses  both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel related costs  including commissions paid to our sales representatives and non cash stock based compensation for equity granted to our sales and marketing staff 
sales and marketing expenses also include payments to channel partners  costs of marketing programs and amortization expense for certain definite lived intangible assets 
our marketing programs include advertising  events and conferences  corporate communications  public relations and other brand building and product marketing expenses 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in additional direct sales personnel in order to add new customers in our existing markets and geographical locations  as well as in emerging global markets 
additionally  we intend to focus on expanding our partnering efforts and allocating more resources to marketing activities  including building greater brand awareness and sponsoring additional marketing events 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related costs  including non cash stock based compensation  for our finance and accounting  legal  human resources  administrative  and internal business systems personnel  amortization expense for certain definite lived intangible assets  as well as non personnel costs such as professional fees and other corporate and public company expenses 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in connection with our continued efforts to make infrastructure enhancements and improvements 
non operating expenses non operating expenses consist of i fair value adjustments to our interest rate swap which matured on june   ii interest expense related to our long term debt  net of interest income generated from our short term investments  iii amortization of debt issuance costs  which are being amortized over the expected remaining life of loan  and iv foreign currency transactions gains and losses  primarily driven by fluctuations between the us dollar  pound sterling and euro 
in addition  during the year ended december   non operating expenses included a loss on extinguishment of debt related to the repayment of our holdings senior pik credit agreement  or the pik loan  and the accelerated recognition of deferred debt issuance costs due to the repayment of outstanding amounts under our pik loan and our second lien credit facility entered into on june   as amended  or the second lien credit facility  in  using the net proceeds from our august initial and our december and april follow on public offerings 
see note to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this form k for additional details regarding the extinguishment of the pik loan and accelerated recognition of deferred debt issuance costs 
income tax expense benefit we are subject to income tax in the united states as well as other countries in which we conduct business 
earnings from our non us activities are subject to local country income tax and may also be subject to current us income tax based on our corporate structure and operations 
our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily as a result of stock based compensation  other non deductible expenses  research and development credits  state taxes  and taxation of our foreign operations 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis 
the following accounting estimates are viewed by management to be critical because they require significant judgment on the part of management 
management has discussed and reviewed the development  selection  and disclosure of critical accounting estimates with our audit committee 
we evaluate these estimates including those related to the determination of the fair value of stock options and estimated forfeitures of equity based awards  the fair value of our reporting unit  valuation of intangible assets and their related useful lives  fair value of financial instruments  certain components of the income tax provisions  including valuation allowances on the company deferred tax assets  accruals for certain compensation expenses  allowances for doubtful accounts and reserves for customer credits 
we base estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
financial results could be materially different if other methodologies were used or if management modified its assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
for further information on our critical and other significant accounting policies  see note  summary of significant accounting policies  of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
revenue recognition we derive revenue principally through fixed commitment contracts under which we provide customers various services  including access to our cloud based intralinks platform  including our intralinks exchanges  as well as the related customer support and other services 
we currently sell our services under service contracts that we consider either subscription or transaction arrangements  as follows subscription arrangements include those customer contracts with an initial term of months or more that automatically renew for successive terms of at least months 
because some long term customers will not accept automatic renewal terms  we also consider among our subscription customers those whose contracts have been extended upon mutual agreement for at least one renewal term of at least months 
we believe subscription arrangements appeal mainly to customers that have integrated our service into their business processes and plan to use our exchanges for a series of expected projects 
subscription arrangements afford customers several benefits  including the ability to manage the creation  opening and closing of any number of exchanges at their convenience during the commitment period  and potentially lower pricing than they would generally be charged under a single event contract 
transaction arrangements include those customer contracts having an initial term of less than months 
we also consider transaction customers to be those first time customers whose contracts do not have an automatic renewal clause  and who have not yet renewed their contracts by mutual agreement 
we believe these types of arrangements appeal mainly to customers who have a single discrete project 
unlike subscription contracts  which generally renew for at least one year at a time  transaction contracts continue in effect after their initial term on a month to month basis  until the customer terminates  often by closing the relevant exchange 
revenue from both subscription and transaction contracts is recognized ratably over the contracted service period  provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service has been provided to the customer  collection is reasonably assured  the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable and we have no significant remaining obligation at the completion of the contracted term 
in circumstances where we have a significant remaining obligation after completion of the initial contract term  revenue is recognized ratably over the extended service period 
our contracts do not contain general rights of return 
certain of our contracts contain customer acceptance clauses  for which revenue is deferred until acceptance occurs 

table of contents under most subscription arrangements  an annual fixed commitment fee is determined based on the aggregate value of the expected number of exchanges required over the term  the type of exchanges expected to be opened  the number of users that are expected to access each exchange and the volume of data expected to be managed in the exchanges 
we bill customers with annual commitment fees in advance  generally in four equal quarterly installments 
similarly  a transaction contract for a single project will have a fee covering services for the expected duration of the project  for which we generally bill customers in full  in advance  upon the commencement of the contract 
subscription and transaction fees payable in advance are recorded initially in accounts receivable  or cash upon their collection  and deferred revenue  until such time that the relevant revenue recognition criteria have been met for such amounts to be included in revenue 
annual subscription fees  as well as the fixed fees payable upfront under transaction contracts  are payable in full and are non refundable regardless of actual usage of services 
similarly  while customers may close exchanges and cease using services  our contracts generally do not allow for cancellation or termination for convenience during the contract term 
we reserve the right under subscription and transaction contracts to charge customers for loading data or adding users to exchanges in excess of their original usage estimates 
incremental fees for overages are billed monthly or quarterly in arrears and the related revenue is recognized ratably from the point that the overage is measured through the remaining contract term  or the remaining contract quarter  depending on the usage terms within the customer contract 
our customers do not have a contractual right  or the ability  to take possession of the intralinks software at any time during the hosting period  or to contract with an unrelated third party to host the intralinks software 
therefore  revenue recognition for our services is not accounted for under the fasb specific guidance on software revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue for our services ratably over the related service period  as described above 
we offer our services to customers through single element and multiple element arrangements  some of which contain offerings for optional services  including document scanning  data archiving and other professional services 
in accordance with the fasb guidance on multiple deliverable arrangements  we have evaluated the deliverables in our arrangements to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting  specifically whether the deliverables have value to our customers on a standalone basis 
we have determined that the services delivered to customers under our existing arrangements generally represent a single unit of accounting 
revenue for optional services is recognized as delivered  or as completed  provided that the general revenue recognition criteria described above are met 
we will continue to evaluate the nature of the services offered to customers under our fixed commitment contracts  as well as our pricing practices  to determine if a change in policy regarding multiple element arrangements and related disclosures is warranted in future periods 
additionally  certain contracts contain provisions for set up and implementation services relating to the customer use of our platform 
we believe that these set up and implementation services provide value to the customer over the entire period that the exchange is active  including renewal periods  and therefore the revenue related to these services is recognized over the longer of the contract term or the estimated relationship life  which  as of december   generally ranged from two to four years 
we continue to evaluate the length of the amortization period of the revenue related to set up and implementation fees  as we gain more experience with customer contract renewals 
from time to time we agree to sales concessions with our customers  a reserve for which is estimated based on historical patterns of actual credits issued 
expenses associated with maintaining this reserve are recorded as a reduction to revenue 
deferred revenue represents the billed but unearned portion of existing contracts for services to be provided 
deferred revenue does not include the unbilled portion of existing contractual commitments of our customers 
accordingly  the deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of outstanding arrangements 
amounts that have been invoiced but not yet collected are recorded as revenue or deferred revenue  as appropriate  and are included in our accounts receivable balances 
deferred revenue that will be recognized during the subsequent month period is classified as deferred revenue with the remaining portion as non current deferred revenue as a component of other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets  included elsewhere in this form k 

table of contents stock based compensation we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of options granted under our stock option and grant plan and equity incentive plan  as well as the rights awarded under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp 
using this model  fair value is calculated based on assumptions with respect to i expected volatility of the our common stock price  ii the expected life of the award  which for options is the period of time over which employees and board directors are expected to hold their options prior to exercise and for espp rights is the period of time between the offering date and the exercise date as defined in note to our consolidated financial statements  iii expected dividend yield on our common stock  and iv a risk free interest rate  which is based on quoted us treasury rates for securities with maturities approximating the expected term 
the use of different assumptions in the black scholes pricing model would result in different amounts of stock based compensation expense 
furthermore  if different assumptions are used in future periods  stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the future 
the fair value of restricted shares of common stock  or rsas  awarded under our restricted preferred stock plan and the stock option and grant plan  and restricted stock units  rsus  awarded under the equity incentive plan  is determined using the intrinsic value of the common stock at the time of grant 
we do not have a significant history of market prices  and as such  we estimate volatility in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment  or sab  using historical volatilities of similar public companies 
we based our analysis of expected volatility on reported data for a peer group of companies within our industry  using an average of the historical volatility measures of this peer group of companies 
we intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar entities until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available  or unless circumstances change such that the identified entities are no longer similar to us 
in this latter case  more suitable entities whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation 
once a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our share price becomes available  we will utilize the closing prices of our publicly traded stock to determine our volatility 
the expected life of options has been determined using the simplified method as prescribed by the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 an amendment to sab  which uses the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
we utilize the simplified method of determining the expected life of options due to the limited period of time our common stock has been publicly traded  thus resulting in a lack of sufficient historical exercise data in a publicly traded environment to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term 
we intend to continue to consistently apply the simplified method until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding exercise data in a publicly traded environment becomes available 
the risk free interest rate is based on quoted us treasury rates for securities with maturities approximating the awards expected term 
the expected dividend yield is zero as we never paid dividends and do not currently anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future 
compensation expense for stock options is recorded over the requisite service period  less estimated forfeitures 
for grants of rsas and rsus  we record compensation expense based on the fair value of the shares on the grant date over the requisite service period  less estimated forfeitures 
compensation expense for espp rights is recorded in line with each respective offering period 
we utilize an estimated forfeiture rate when calculating expense for the period 
we consider several factors when estimating future forfeitures  including types of awards  employee level and historical experience 
if this estimated rate changes in future periods due to different actual forfeitures  our stock compensation expense may increase or decrease significantly 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities or the terms of the awards  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unamortized share based compensation 
income taxes we account for income taxes on the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards  and temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred income taxes are measured using enacted tax rates applicable to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in our results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
we assess whether it is necessary to establish a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets if we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
our evaluation includes assessing both positive eg  sources of taxable income and negative eg  recent historical losses evidence potentially impacting their realizability 

table of contents we recognize the impact of an uncertain tax position in our financial statements if  based on the technical merits of the position  we believe the position is more likely than not sustainable upon audit 
this involves the identification of potential uncertain tax positions  the evaluation of relevant tax law and an assessment of whether a liability for each uncertain tax position is necessary 
we operate and are subject to audit in multiple taxing jurisdictions 
we record interest expense and penalties on uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense 
investments our investment portfolio may at any time contain investments in us treasury obligations  securities guaranteed by the us government  certificates of deposit  corporate notes and bonds  medium term notes  commercial paper  and money market mutual funds  each with original maturities less than one year 
our investments with original maturity dates of less than three months from the purchase date are included in cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets contained elsewhere in this form k 
our investments with original maturity dates in excess of three months  but less than one year  from the purchase date are classified as short term investments on the consolidated balance sheets contained elsewhere in this form k 
short term investments classified as held to maturity are recorded at amortized cost 
interest earned on short term investments is recorded to interest income which is presented net of interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations  included elsewhere in this form k 
fair value of financial instruments the carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments classified as held to maturity  accounts receivable  accounts payable and other accrued expenses  approximate fair value due to the short term nature of these instruments 
see derivative instruments and hedging activities below for a discussion of our accounting policy for our interest rate swap 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis 
the evaluation includes historical loss experience  length of time receivables are past due  adverse situations that may affect a customer ability to repay and prevailing market conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective and estimates may be revised as more information becomes available 
software development costs we account for the cost of computer software developed or obtained for internal use of our application service by capitalizing qualifying costs which are incurred during the application development stage and amortizing them over the expected period of benefit  which we have determined to be three years for most internally developed software  beginning when the software is ready for its intended use 
costs incurred in the preliminary and post implementation stages of our products are expensed as incurred 
the amounts capitalized include external direct costs of services used in developing internal use software and for payroll and payroll related costs of employees directly associated with the development activities 
software development costs are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
during  the company recorded an impairment loss on capitalized software of million 
goodwill at december   we had million of goodwill recorded as a result of the merger that occurred on june  goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred 
we have one reporting unit that is evaluated in the annual impairment test  which is performed each october on september   the fasb issued authoritative guidance which gives entities the option of performing a qualitative assessment of goodwill prior to calculating the fair value of a reporting unit in step of the goodwill impairment test 
if entities determine  on the basis of qualitative factors  that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount  the two step impairment test is required to be performed 
we adopted this newly issued authoritative guidance effective october  in the second quarter of  the company performed a goodwill impairment test as a result of the continued depressed stock price and the market capitalization of the company relative to net book value 
step of the goodwill impairment test was performed using a combination of a discounted cash flow dcf analysis and a market based approach 
the forecasted cash flows employed in the dcf analysis were based on the company s most recent forecast and business plans and represent the company s best estimate of future results as of june  within a range of possible outcomes 
in addition  the company made the following assumptions in its dcf analysis i a growth factor to calculate the terminal value of its reporting unit and ii a discount rate to calculate the terminal value of its reporting unit  both of which are consistent with rates used in the annual impairment test 
the step valuation also considered the market capitalization of the company as of the second quarter of  adjusted for an estimated equity control premium of 

table of contents we completed our most recent impairment analysis as of october  among the factors included in our qualitative assessment were i our market capitalization  ii general economic conditions and the competitive environment  iii actual and expected financial performance  iv forward looking business measurements  v external market conditions  vi our stock price performance compared to overall market and industry peers  and vii other relevant entity specific events 
based on the results of the qualitative assessment  we concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is more than its carrying amount  and therefore performance of the two step quantitative impairment test was not necessary 
there were no impairments of goodwill in any of the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this form k 
however  the company most recent goodwill impairment test showed that the company could be at risk of recording a goodwill impairment in the future if  for example  the company stock price remained at a depressed level or the company has a negative change in its future cash flow projections 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
when performing the quantitative analysis  we have utilized valuation techniques consistent with the income approach and market approach to measure fair value for purposes of impairment testing 
an estimate of fair value can be affected by many assumptions  requiring that management make significant judgments in arriving at these estimates  including the expected operational performance of our business in the future  market conditions and other factors 
although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process  the estimates and assumptions we use to estimate future cash flows including sales growth  pricing of our services  market penetration  competition  technological obsolescence  fair value of net operating loss carryforwards and discount rates are consistent with our internal planning 
significant changes in these estimates and the related assumptions  or changes in qualitative factors affecting us in the future  could result in an impairment charge related to our goodwill 
other intangible and long lived assets our definite lived intangible assets include developed technology  customer relationships  contractual backlog  trade names and non compete agreements 
developed technology and contractual backlog are being amortized over their estimated useful lives at accelerated rates consistent with the expected future cash flows to be generated by the assets 
all other intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  which we believe is consistent with the expected future cash flows to be generated by the respective assets 
other long lived assets primarily consist of computer and office equipment and software  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  which are subject to depreciation over the useful life of the asset 
the useful lives of our definite lived intangible and other long lived assets are determined based on our estimate of the period over which the asset will be utilized  such periods are periodically reviewed for reasonableness 
we may be required to change these estimates based on changes in our industry or other changing circumstances 
if these estimates change in the future  we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation expense for these assets 
other intangible and long lived assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
in evaluating an asset for recoverability  we estimate the future cash flow expected to result from the use of the asset and eventual disposition 
if the expected future undiscounted cash flow is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss  equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset  is recognized 
no impairments were recorded on long lived assets for the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
the process of assessing potential impairment of our definite lived intangible and long lived assets is highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
an estimate of future undiscounted cash flow can be affected by many assumptions  requiring that management make significant judgments in arriving at these estimates  which include sales growth  pricing of our services  market penetration  competition and technological obsolescence 
in each of the years presented  we did not identify any indicators of impairment related to our definite lived intangible and long lived assets  and therefore were not required to assess impairment utilizing an undiscounted cash flow model 
however  significant future changes in these estimates or their related assumptions could result in an impairment charge related to individual or groups of these assets 
derivative instruments and hedging activities we maintained an interest rate swap agreement to economically hedge our exposure to changes in the amounts of future cash flows  driven by the variable rates associated with our long term debt  which matured in june our interest rate swap was recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
the fair value of the interest rate swap was measured each reporting period and included a credit valuation adjustment that reflects consideration of our own credit risk  since the interest rate swap was in a liability position 
valuations may fluctuate considerably from period to period due to volatility in underlying interest rates  which is driven by market conditions and the duration of the derivative instrument 
we do not hold derivatives and do not use financial instruments for any trading or other speculative purposes 

table of contents warranties and indemnification our revenue contracts generally provide for indemnification of customers against liabilities arising from third party claims that are attributable to the breach of warranties or infringement of third party intellectual property rights  subject to contractual limitations of liability 
to date  we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications and have not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k as we currently have no infringement or warranty related disputes with customers or third parties 
we have entered into service level agreements with a minority of our customers warranting certain levels of uptime and permitting those customers to receive credits or terminate their arrangement in the event that we fail to meet those levels

as a result of our fiscal excess free cash flow  we made a mandatory prepayment on april  of approximately million 
in line with the terms of the first lien credit agreement  an excess cash flow mandatory prepayment was not required for fiscal years and  due to our consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement being less than at december  and the term loans under the first lien credit agreement  as amended  bear interest at the higher of the eurodollar rate as defined in the credit agreement or plus per annum  resulting in an interest rate of at december  interest payments on the first lien credit facility are due on the last business day of each month

table of contents additionally  in order to borrow against the revolving line of credit under the first lien credit facility our senior secured debt to consolidated ebitda ratio as defined under the first lien credit facility for the trailing four quarters must be less than to as of the last day of each fiscal quarter through the maturity date 
our senior secured debt to consolidated ebitda ratio at december  was 
we were in compliance with all of our financial and non financial covenants as of december  these agreements also contain customary events of default  including  but not limited to  cross defaults among these agreements 
although we currently expect to remain in compliance with these existing covenants  any breach of these covenants or a change in control could result in a default  and subsequent cross defaults  under our credit agreements  which could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness to become immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments from our lenders to extend further credit 
liquidity and capital resources we currently use the net cash generated from operations to fund our working capital needs and our capital expenditure requirements 
our available financing arrangements include a million revolving line of credit  of which million is available to us as of december  at december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  million in short term investments  and million in accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts and credit reserve

in april  in connection with our follow on public stock offering  we received net proceeds of million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions 
we used substantially all of the net proceeds from our public stock offerings to repay indebtedness

the net proceeds from the april follow on public stock offering were used to prepay a portion of the amount outstanding under our first lien credit facility 
subsequently  in april  we voluntarily repaid million of outstanding indebtedness 
this overall reduction of our outstanding indebtedness has significantly reduced the total interest expense we expect to pay on our outstanding indebtedness in future periods 
the credit markets have experienced disruption that reached unprecedented levels during late and and  more recently  in the disruption in the financial markets has affected some of the financial institutions with which we do business 
a continued  sustained decline in the stability of these financial institutions could adversely affect our access to financing  as well as our revenue growth due to our customer base in the dcm and m a markets 
additionally  if the national or global economy or credit market conditions in general were to deteriorate further  it is possible that those changes could adversely affect our credit ratings  among other things  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain external financing or to refinance our existing indebtedness 
our corporate credit ratings and rating agency outlooks as of december  are summarized in the table below 
rating agency rating outlook moody b stable standard poor b stable credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically  and therefore the credit rating assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time 
factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance  the economic environment  our financial position  conditions in any of our principal markets  and changes in our business strategy 
if weak financial market conditions or competitive dynamics cause any of these factors to deteriorate  we could see a reduction in our corporate credit rating 
on may   standard poor rating services placed all of our credit ratings  including our bb corporate credit rating  on creditwatch with negative implications 
subsequently on august   the standard poor rating services lowered our corporate credit rating from bb to b with a stable outlook 
the stable outlook reflects a significant level of recurring base revenues  good channel partner relationships and a conservative financial policy 
we will continue the steadfast execution of our strategic growth plan and remain committed to maintaining a strong credit rating

contractual obligations and commitments the following table sets forth  as of december   certain significant cash obligations that will affect our future liquidity 
total less than year years years more than years long term debt  including current portion interest on long term debt operating leases third party hosting commitments other contractual commitments including interest total long term debt and interest on long term debt interest on long term debt consists of expected interest payments on the first lien credit facility through its maturity date  june   based on assumptions regarding the amount of debt outstanding and assumed interest rates 
the assumed interest rate on the first lien credit facility was  representing a libor floor plus a spread 
other financing arrangements in june  we entered into a financing arrangement in the amount of million for third party software  including financing costs of million to be repaid over a term of months 
in december  we entered into a second financing arrangement for licensing and support of internal systems in the amount of million to be repaid over a term of months 
in august  we entered into a financing arrangement in the ordinary course of business to purchase directors and officers  or d o  insurance in the amount of million  of which million was to be repaid over a term of months 
operating leases and third party hosting commitments our principal executive office in new york  new york occupies approximately  square feet 
this space is comprised of  square feet that are subject to a lease agreement that expires in july and  square feet that are subject to a sublease agreement that expires in december in addition  our facility in charlestown  massachusetts occupies  square feet under a lease that expires in december we also maintain space in amsterdam  london  paris  chicago  s o paulo  frankfurt  sydney and san francisco for our sales and services activities 
we believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs  however  we may obtain additional office space to house additional services personnel in the near future  and we may require other additional office space as our business grows 
our commitments to our third party hosting provider expire in december our hosting obligations are largely impacted by service expansion requirements in line with the growth of our business 
uncertain tax positions tax reserves for uncertain tax positions  excluding interest and penalties  totaled million and million at december  and december   respectively 
they are included in other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
we do not expect the balance of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly increase or decrease over the next twelve months 
we are not able to reasonably estimate when we would make cash payments required to settle these liabilities beyond the next twelve months  however  we do not believe that the ultimate settlement of our obligations will materially affect our liquidity 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have  and did not have during the periods presented  any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined under sec rules  such as relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  which are often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  established for the purpose of facilitating financing transactions that are not required to be reflected on our consolidated balance sheets

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
interest rate sensitivity term loans under the first lien credit agreement  as amended  bear interest at the higher of the eurodollar rate or  plus per annum 
although the interest on our first lien credit facility is defined as variable  the existence of the eurodollar rate floor of has caused us  in recent years  to not be subject to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates because the eurodollar rate has been considerably lower than 
if the eurodollar rate were to rise above  our results of operations  specifically interest expense on the first lien credit facility  would be subject to market risk

on june   our interest rate swap matured 
however  the fair value of the interest rate swap was measured each reporting period and included a credit valuation adjustment that reflected consideration of our credit risk  since the interest rate swap was in a liability position 
the fair value measurement of the swap fluctuated considerably from period to period due to volatility in underlying interest rates  which were driven by market conditions and the duration of the swap 
in both of the years ended december  and  a increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an increase or decrease of million to other income expense  net  within our consolidated statement of operations 
the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal  provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities we invest in are subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the value of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including money market funds  certificates of deposit  us treasuries  commercial paper and corporate debt securities 
a decrease in interest rates in the years ended december  and would not have had a material impact on a total dollar basis on our interest income during those periods  respectively  due to the immateriality of the interest income generated by our investments during those periods 
foreign currency exchange risk during the year ended december   approximately of our revenues were generated from sales across more than countries outside of the united states 
our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly between the us dollar  pound sterling and euro 
during the year ended december  and  we incurred a foreign currency transaction gain of million and a loss of million in those respective periods 
the debt crisis in europe has resulted in uncertainty with the stability of the euro 
efforts to prevent the collapse of euro member economies have proven effective and continued progress is apparent in early with a significant portion of our revenue being generated in europe  our european operations are subject to risk if the euro were to be devalued 
for example  the effect of a devaluation in the euro on our revenue generating activities in europe would have resulted in an additional million recorded as a loss to our other income expense  net within our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  comparatively  an appreciation in the euro of on our revenue generating activities in europe would have resulted in an additional million recorded as a gain to our other income expense  net within our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  
table of contents in addition  a significant portion of our revenue generating activities is in the united kingdom 
as a result  a devaluation in the pound sterling on our revenue generating activities in the united kingdom would have resulted in an additional million recorded as a gain to our other income expense  net within our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  comparatively  an appreciation in the pound sterling of on our revenue generating activities in the united kingdom would have resulted in an additional million recorded as a loss to our other income expense  net within our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  inflation risk our monetary assets  consisting primarily of cash  cash equivalents and investments  are not affected significantly by inflation because they are short term 
we believe the impact of inflation on replacement costs of equipment  furniture and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations 
the rate of inflation  however  affects our cost of revenue and expenses  such as those for employee compensation  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of the services offered by us
