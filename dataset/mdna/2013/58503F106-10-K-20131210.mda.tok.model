overview we are an externally managed  non diversified closed end management investment company that filed an election to be regulated as a bdc under the act 
in addition  we have elected and qualified to be treated for us federal income tax purposes as a ric under subchapter m of the code 
we commenced operations and completed our initial public offering on january  our investment activities are managed by mcc advisors and supervised by our board of directors  of which a majority of the members are independent of us 
our investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation by lending directly to privately held middle market companies to help these companies fund acquisitions  growth or refinancing 
our portfolio generally consists of senior secured first lien term loans and senior secured second lien term loans 
in many of our investments  we receive warrants or other equity participation features which we believe will increase the total investment returns 
as a bdc  we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements 
for instance  we generally have to invest at least of our total assets in qualifying assets  including securities of private or thinly traded public us companies  cash  cash equivalents  us government securities and high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less 
in addition  we are only allowed to borrow money such that our asset coverage  as defined in the act  equals at least after such borrowing  with certain limited exceptions 
to maintain our ric status  we must meet specified source of income and asset diversification requirements 
to maintain our ric tax treatment under subchapter m for us federal income tax purposes  we must distribute at least of our net ordinary income and realized net short term capital gains in excess of realized net long term capital losses  if any  for the taxable year 
revenues we generate revenue in the form of interest income on the debt that we hold and capital gains  if any  on warrants or other equity interests that we may acquire in portfolio companies 
we invest our assets primarily in privately held companies with enterprise or asset values between million and million and focus on investment sizes of million to million 
we believe that pursuing opportunities of this size offers several benefits including reduced competition  a larger investment opportunity set and the ability to minimize the impact of financial intermediaries 
we expect our debt investments to bear interest at either a fixed or floating rate 
interest on debt will be payable generally either monthly or quarterly 
in some cases our debt investments may provide for a portion of the interest to be pik 
to the extent interest is pik  it will be payable through the increase of the principal amount of the obligation by the amount of interest due on the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of such obligation 
the principal amount of the debt and any accrued but unpaid interest will generally become due at the maturity date 
in addition  we may generate revenue in the form of commitment  origination  structuring or diligence fees  fees for providing managerial assistance or investment management services and possibly consulting fees 
any such fees will be generated in connection with our investments and recognized as earned 
expenses our primary operating expenses include the payment of management and incentive fees pursuant to the investment management agreement we have with mcc advisors and overhead expenses  including our allocable portion of our administrator s overhead under the administration agreement 
our management and incentive fees compensate mcc advisors for its work in identifying  evaluating  negotiating  closing and monitoring our investments

we believe that the ltv ratio for a portfolio investment is a useful indicator of the riskiness of the portfolio investment  or its likelihood of default 
as part of our investment strategy  we seek to structure transactions with downside protection and seek ltvs of lower than 
we regularly evaluate the ltv of our portfolio investments and believe that ltv is a useful indicator for management and investors 
as of september   our income bearing investment portfolio  which represented nearly of our total portfolio  had a weighted average yield based upon cost of our portfolio investments of approximately  and of our income bearing investment portfolio bore interest based on floating rates  such as libor  and bore interest at fixed rates 
mcc advisors regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and rates each of them based on the following categories  which we refer to as mcc advisors investment credit rating credit rating definition investments that are performing above expectations 
investments that are performing within expectations  with risks that are neutral or favorable compared to risks at the time of origination 
all new loans are rated 
investments that are performing below expectations and that require closer monitoring  but where no loss of interest  dividend or principal is expected 
companies rated may be out of compliance with financial covenants  however  loan payments are generally not past due 
investments that are performing below expectations and for which risk has increased materially since origination 
some loss of interest or dividend is expected but no loss of principal 
in addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants  loan payments may be past due but generally not more than days past due 
investments that are performing substantially below expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since origination 
most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent 
some loss of principal is expected

the interest rate of sba guaranteed debentures is fixed on a semi annual basis at a market driven spread over us treasury notes with year maturities 
the sba  as a creditor  will have a superior claim to the sbic lp s assets over our stockholders in the event we liquidate the sbic lp or the sba exercises its remedies under the sba guaranteed debentures issued by the sbic lp upon an event of default 
sba regulations currently limit the amount that the sbic lp may borrow to a maximum of million when it has at least million in regulatory capital  receives a capital commitment from the sba and has been through an examination by the sba subsequent to licensing 
on november   we obtained exemptive relief from the sec to permit us to exclude the debt of the sbic lp guaranteed by the sba from our asset coverage test under the act

any new investment management agreement would also be subject to approval by our stockholders 
distributions we have elected and qualified to be treated for us federal income tax purposes as a ric under subchapter m of the code 
as a ric  in any taxable year with respect to which we distribute at least percent of the sum of our i investment company taxable income which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short term capital gains over realized net long term capital losses determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and ii net tax exempt interest income which is the excess of our gross tax exempt interest income over certain disallowed deductions  we but not our stockholders generally will not be subject to us federal income tax on investment company taxable income and net capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders 
we intend to distribute annually all or substantially all of such income 
to the extent that we retain our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income  we may be subject to us federal income tax 
we may choose to retain our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income  and pay the associated federal corporate income tax  including the federal excise tax described below 
amounts not distributed on a timely basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a nondeductible us federal excise tax payable by us 
to avoid this tax  we must distribute or be deemed to have distributed during each calendar year an amount equal to the sum of at least percent of our ordinary income not taking into account any capital gains or losses for the calendar year  at least percent of the amount by which our capital gains exceed our capital losses adjusted for certain ordinary losses for a one year period ending on october st of the calendar year  and income realized  but not distributed  in preceding years 
while we intend to distribute any income and capital gains in the manner necessary to minimize imposition of the us federal excise tax  sufficient amounts of our taxable income and capital gains may not be distributed to avoid entirely the imposition of the tax 
in that event  we will be liable for the tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement 
we intend to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution 
we cannot assure you that we will achieve investment results that will allow us to pay a specified level of dividends or year to year increases in dividends 
in addition  the inability to satisfy the asset coverage test applicable to us as a bdc could limit our ability to pay dividends 
all dividends will be paid at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings  our financial condition  maintenance of our ric status  compliance with applicable bdc regulations and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time 
we cannot assure you that we will pay dividends to our stockholders in the future 
to the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for that fiscal year  a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders for us federal income tax purposes 
thus  the source of a distribution to our stockholders may be the original capital invested by the stockholder rather than our income or gains 
stockholders should read any written disclosure accompanying a distribution carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains 
we have adopted an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders 
as a result  if we declare a cash dividend or other distribution  each stockholder that has not opted out of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their dividends automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock rather than receiving cash dividends 
stockholders who receive distributions in the form of shares of common stock will be subject to the same federal  state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions

we will not make any investments if they are not permitted by applicable law and interpretive positions of the sec and its staff  or if they are inconsistent with mcc advisors allocation procedures 
in addition  we have adopted a formal code of ethics that governs the conduct of our and mcc advisors officers  directors and employees 
our officers and directors also remain subject to the duties imposed by both the act and the delaware general corporation law 
management fee pursuant to the investment management agreement  we pay our investment adviser a fee for investment management services consisting of two components a base management fee and an incentive fee 
mcc advisors receives a base management fee from us payable quarterly in arrears  at an annual rate of of our gross assets  including any assets acquired with the proceeds of leverage 
mcc advisors agreed to waive the base management fee payable with respect to cash and cash equivalents held by the company through december  the investment management agreement also provides that mcc advisors is entitled to an incentive fee of 
the incentive fee consists of two parts the first component  which is payable quarterly in arrears  equals of the excess  if any  of the pre incentive fee net investment income over a hurdle rate quarterly and subject to a catch up provision measured as of the end of each calendar quarter

the effect of this provision is that  if pre incentive fee net investment income exceeds in any calendar quarter  mcc advisors will receive of our pre incentive fee net investment income as if the hurdle rate did not apply  and the second component  which is payable in arrears at the end of each calendar year or upon termination of the investment management agreement  as of the termination date  commencing with the year ending december   equals of our cumulative aggregate realized capital gains less cumulative realized capital losses  unrealized capital depreciation unrealized depreciation on a gross investment by investment basis at the end of each calendar year and all capital gains upon which prior performance based capital gains incentive fee payments were previously made to mcc advisors 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could materially differ from those estimates 
we have identified the following items as critical accounting policies 
valuation of portfolio investments we value investments for which market quotations are readily available at their market quotations  which are generally obtained from an independent pricing service or multiple broker dealers or market makers 
we weight the use of third party broker quotes  if any  in determining fair value based on our understanding of the level of actual transactions used by the broker to develop the quote and whether the quote was an indicative price or binding offer 
however  a readily available market value is not expected to exist for many of the investments in our portfolio  and we value these portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors under our valuation policy and process 
we may seek pricing information with respect to certain of our investments from pricing services or brokers or dealers in order to value such investments 
we also employ independent third party valuation firms for all of our investments for which there is not a readily available market value 
valuation methods may include comparisons of financial ratios of the portfolio companies that issued such private equity securities to peer companies that are public  the nature and realizable value of any collateral  the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flows  the markets in which the portfolio company does business  and other relevant factors 
when an external event such as a purchase transaction  public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs  we will consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate the private equity valuation 
due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value  the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments  and the differences could be material 
our board of directors is ultimately and solely responsible for determining the fair value of the investments in our portfolio that are not publicly traded  whose market prices are not readily available on a quarterly basis or any other situation where portfolio investments require a fair value determination 
with respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available  our board of directors will undertake a multi step valuation process each quarter  as described below our quarterly valuation process begins with each investment being initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for monitoring the portfolio investment 
preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with senior management 
at least twice annually  the valuation for each portfolio investment is reviewed by an independent valuation firm 
the audit committee of our board of directors reviews the preliminary valuations of the investment professionals  senior management and independent valuation firms 
our board of directors discusses the valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of mcc advisors  the respective independent valuation firms and the audit committee 
in following these approaches  the types of factors that are taken into account in fair value pricing investments include available current market data  including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables  applicable market yields and multiples  security covenants  call protection provisions  information rights  the nature and realizable value of any collateral  the portfolio company s ability to make payments  the portfolio company s earnings and discounted cash flows  the markets in which the portfolio company does business  comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public  comparable merger and acquisition transactions  and the principal market and enterprise values 
determination of fair values involves subjective judgments and estimates not verifiable by auditing procedures 
under current auditing standards  the notes to our financial statements refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations  and any change in such valuations  on our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are as follows investments and related investment income 
we account for investment transactions on a trade date basis and interest income  adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts  is recorded on an accrual basis 
for investments with contractual pik interest  which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the principal balance that generally becomes due at maturity  we will not accrue pik interest if the portfolio company valuation indicates that the pik interest is not collectible 
origination  closing and or commitment fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are recognized as income when the investment transaction closes 
other fees are capitalized as deferred revenue and recorded into income over the respective period 
prepayment penalties received by the company for debt instruments paid back to the company prior to the maturity date are recorded as income upon receipt 
realized gains or losses on investments are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of investment  without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized 
we report changes in the fair value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments in our consolidated statement of operations 
non accrual 
we place loans on non accrual status when principal and interest payments are past due by days or more  or when there is reasonable doubt that we will collect principal or interest 
accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non accrual 
interest payments received on non accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment 
non accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and  in our management s judgment  are likely to remain current 
at september   one portfolio company was on pik non accrual status with a fair value of approximately million  or of the fair value of our portfolio 
at september   we had no portfolio company on non accrual status 
federal income taxes the company has elected and qualified to be treated for us federal income tax purposes as a ric under subchapter m of the code  commencing with its first taxable year as a corporation  and it intends to operate in a manner so as to maintain its ric tax treatment 
as a ric  among other things  the company is required to meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements 
once qualified as a ric  the company must timely distribute to its stockholders at least of the sum of investment company taxable income icti including pik  as defined by the code  and net tax exempt interest income which is the excess of our gross tax exempt interest income over certain disallowed deductions for each taxable year in order to be eligible for tax treatment under subchapter m of the code 
the company will be subject to a nondeductible us federal excise tax of on undistributed income if it does not distribute at least of its ordinary income in any calendar year and of its capital gain net income for each one year period ending on october of such calendar year 
depending on the level of icti earned in a tax year  the company may choose to carry forward icti in excess of current year dividend distributions into the next tax year and pay a excise tax on such income  as required 
to the extent that the company determines that its estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions for excise tax purposes  the company accrues excise tax  if any  on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned 
depending on the level of icti earned in a tax year  the company may choose to carry forward icti in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year and pay a excise tax on such excess 
any such carryover icti must be distributed before the end of that next tax year through a dividend declared prior to filing the final tax return related to the year which generated such icti 
because federal income tax regulations differ from gaap  distributions in accordance with tax regulations may differ from net investment income and realized gains recognized for financial reporting purposes 
differences may be permanent or temporary 
permanent differences are reclassified among capital accounts in the consolidated financial statements to reflect their tax character 
temporary differences arise when certain items of income  expense  gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future 
differences in classification may also result from the treatment of short term gains as ordinary income for tax purposes 
recent developments on october   the company s board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per share payable on december   to stockholders of record at the close of business on november  on november   we have received an amended order from the sec that expanded our ability to negotiate the terms of co investment transactions with other funds managed by mcc advisors or its affiliates  including sierra income corporation  a non traded business development company  subject to the conditions included therein 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates may affect both our cost of funding and our interest income from portfolio investments and cash and cash equivalents 
our investment income will be affected by changes in various interest rates  including libor  to the extent our debt investments include floating interest rates 
in the future  we expect other loans in our portfolio will have floating rates 
we may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures  options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the act 
for the year ended september   we did not engage in hedging activities 
as of september   of our income bearing investment portfolio bore interest based on floating rates 
the compositions of our floating rate debt investments by cash interest rate floor as of september  and were as follows september  september  fair value thousands of floating rate portfolio fair value thousands of floating rate portfolio under   to under   to under   total   based on our consolidated statement of assets and liabilities as of september   the following table shows the approximate increase decrease in components of net assets resulting from operations of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates  assuming no changes in our investment and capital structure 
basis point increase interest income thousands interest expense thousands net increase decrease thousands a hypothetical decline in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial statements
