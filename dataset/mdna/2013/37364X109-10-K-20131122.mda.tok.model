item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s discussion and analysis of the major elements of our consolidated financial statements 
you should read this discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements  including the accompanying notes  and other detailed information appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k  including under the heading risk factors 
the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations includes various forward looking statements about our markets  the demand for our products and services and our future plans and results 
these statements are based on assumptions that we consider to be reasonable  but that could prove to be incorrect 
for more information regarding our assumptions  you should refer to the section entitled forward looking statements and assumptions contained in this item in this annual report on form k 
background we design and manufacture instruments and equipment used by the oil and gas industry to acquire seismic data in order to locate  characterize and monitor hydrocarbon producing reservoirs 
the company also designs and manufactures non seismic products  including industrial products  offshore cables  thermal printing equipment and film 
see the information under the heading business in this annual report on form k 
consolidated results of operations as we have reported in the past  our sales and operating profits have varied significantly from quarter to quarter  and even year to year  and are expected to continue that trend in the future  especially when our quarterly or annual financial results are impacted by the presence or absence of relatively large  but somewhat erratic  shipments of permanent seabed reservoir monitoring systems and or wireless data acquisition systems for land and marine applications 
we report and evaluate financial information for two segments seismic and non seismic 
summary financial data by business segment follows in thousands year ended september  seismic traditional exploration product revenues wireless exploration product revenues reservoir product revenues total sales operating income non seismic sales operating income corporate sales operating loss consolidated totals sales operating income overview fiscal year compared to fiscal year consolidated sales for fiscal year increased million  or  from fiscal year this increase in sales reflects greater demand for our seismic permanent reservoir monitoring products 
consolidated gross profit for fiscal year increased by million  or  from fiscal year the increase in gross profit resulted from increased sales of our permanent reservoir monitoring products 
consolidated operating expenses for fiscal year increased million  or  from fiscal year the increase in operating expenses reflects higher personnel costs and other general expense increases associated with our sales growth and asset expansion 
the us statutory tax rate applicable to us for fiscal years and was  however  our effective tax rate was and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the lower effective tax rate for both fiscal years resulted from i the impact of the manufacturers producers deduction available in the united states  and ii research and experimentation tax credits 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year consolidated sales for fiscal year increased million  or  from fiscal year the higher level of sales resulted from increased customer demand for our seismic products and particularly robust demand for sales and rentals of our land based wireless or nodal data acquisition systems 
the increased demand for our seismic products is being driven by strong oil and gas exploration activities throughout the world 
consolidated gross profit for fiscal year increased by million  or  from fiscal year the increase in gross profits resulted from increased sales and rentals of our seismic products 
consolidated operating expenses for fiscal year increased million  or  from fiscal year the increase in operating expenses resulted from expanded activities associated with our sales growth  and from increased incentive compensation expenses 
the us statutory tax rate applicable to us for fiscal years and was  however  our effective tax rate was and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the lower effective tax rate for both fiscal years resulted from i the impact of the manufacturers producers deduction available in the united states  ii lower tax rates applicable to income earned in foreign tax jurisdictions and iii research and experimentation tax credits 
segment results of operations seismic products fiscal year compared to fiscal year sales sales of our seismic products for the fiscal year ended september  increased by million  or  from the prior fiscal year 
the components of this increase include the following traditional product sales and rentals for the fiscal year ended september   revenues from our traditional products decreased million  or  from the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year 
the decline in revenues resulted from lower demand for our geophone products  marine products and connector products 
we believe this decline in sales of our traditional products is partially due to a general decline in seismic exploration activities in north america caused by producers focusing investment activities on oil and gas distribution infrastructure during with increasing production and declining demand for crude oil in north america  we believe the market for many of our traditional seismic products could remain challenged in future periods 
wireless product sales and rentals for the fiscal year ended september   sales and rental revenues from our land and marine wireless products increased by million  or  from the prior fiscal year 
during fiscal year  we sold approximately  channels of land wireless systems  including the sale of  channels of used wireless equipment from our rental fleet which generated revenues of million 
we believe demand for land and marine wireless channel sales and rentals  although erratic from quarter to quarter  will continue into the future and reflects the seismic industry s acceptance of our wireless systems in lieu of less efficient legacy cable based systems 
this product line represents a significant part of our revenues and quarterly fluctuations can significantly impact our operating income 
reservoir product sales  rentals and services for the fiscal year ended september   revenues from our reservoir products increased million  or  from the prior fiscal year 
during the year ended september   we recorded revenues of approximately million for delivery of a reservoir characterization system to shell brasil petr leo ltda and we recognized revenues under the percentage of completion method of approximately million from production of the statoil order 
revenues from our reservoir products  which in recent years primarily reflected sales of our seismic borehole tools  have historically been erratic 
the rate of new customer orders for our seismic products  especially large orders for our wireless  marine  borehole and subsea reservoir products  generally occur irregularly thereby making it difficult for us to predict our sales and production levels each quarter 
furthermore  product shipping dates are generally determined by our customers and are not at our discretion 
as a result  these factors have caused past sales of our seismic products to be unpredictable and we expect this trend to continue into the future 
operating income 
operating income for fiscal year increased million  or  from fiscal year the higher level of operating income resulted primarily from the recognition of revenues from our permanent reservoir monitoring systems 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year sales sales of our seismic products for the fiscal year ended september  increased by million  or  from the prior fiscal year 
the components of this increase include the following traditional product sales and rentals for the fiscal year ended september   revenues from our traditional products decreased million  or  from the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year 
this decline in revenues primarily resulted from reduced shipments of marine products and was partially offset by increased sales of geophones and connectors 
wireless product sales and rentals for the fiscal year ended september   revenues from our wireless products increased by million  or  from the prior fiscal year 
during fiscal year  we sold approximately  channels of land wireless systems  including the sale of  channels of used wireless equipment from our rental fleet which generated revenues of million 
the increase in revenues resulted from the continued industry acceptance of our wireless systems in lieu of less efficient legacy cable based systems 
reservoir product sales  rentals and services for the fiscal year ended september   revenues from our reservoir products decreased million  or  from the prior fiscal year 
revenues from these products  which in recent years primarily include our seismic borehole tools  have historically been erratic 
due to the recent receipt of large orders for our permanent seabed reservoir monitoring systems  we expect revenues for our reservoir products to increase significantly in future years 
operating income 
operating income for fiscal year increased million  or  from fiscal year the higher level of operating income resulted from increased wireless product sales and the recognition of revenues from our reservoir products 
non seismic products fiscal year compared to fiscal year sales 
sales of our non seismic products for the year ended september  decreased by million  or  from fiscal year this decrease is primarily due to lower sales of our thermal solutions and industrial sensor products to our european customers which appear to have been impacted by the region s economic crisis 
we expect the european market for sales of our non seismic products to remain challenging during fiscal year operating income 
our operating income associated with sales of our non seismic products for the year ended september  decreased million  or  from the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in operating income resulted from lower sales levels  and lower profit margins due to less favorable sales mix and higher operating expenses 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year sales 
sales of our non seismic products for fiscal year increased million  or  from fiscal year this increase resulted from higher sales of our offshore cable products  and was partially offset by a decrease in sales of our thermal imaging products 
operating income 
our operating income from our non seismic products for fiscal year increased million  or  from fiscal year the increase in operating income resulted from increased product sales 
incentive compensation program we adopted an incentive compensation program for fiscal year whereby most employees will be eligible to begin earning incentive compensation if the company reaches a five percent pretax return on stockholders equity  determined as of september  to be eligible to participate in this incentive compensation program  employees must participate in our core values program 
based on our experience in prior years  we expect one hundred percent of our eligible employees to participate in the core values program 
the incentive compensation program does not apply to the employees of our subsidiary in the russian federation since such employees participate in a locally administered bonus program 
certain non executive employees are required to achieve specific goals to earn a significant portion of their total incentive compensation award 
any bonus awards earned under this program in fiscal year will be paid out to eligible employees after the end of the fiscal year 
upon reaching the five percent threshold under this proposed program  an incentive compensation accrual will be established equal to percent of the amount of any consolidated pretax profits above the five percent pretax return threshold 
the maximum aggregate bonus available under the program for fiscal year was million 
for the fiscal years ended september  and  we had accrued million and million  respectively  of incentive compensation expense 
liquidity and capital resources fiscal year at september   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
for fiscal year  we used approximately million of cash from operating activities 
sources of cash generated in our operating activities included our net income of million 
additional sources of cash included net non cash charges of million for deferred income taxes  depreciation  amortization  accretion  stock based compensation  inventory obsolescence and bad debts and a million increase accrued expenses and other 
these sources of cash were offset by uses of cash which included i a million increase in inventories due to current and expected future production for the statoil order and for production of marine and land wireless products in anticipation of future orders  ii a million increase in trade accounts and notes receivable primarily resulting from increased sales and the timing of cash collections  iii a million adjustment to transfer gross profits from rental equipment sales to investing activities since such transactions involve the sale of long lived assets  iv a million increase in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings for the statoil order  v a million decrease in deferred revenue primarily due to the revenue recognition of advance payments received from shell brasil petr leo ltda  vi a million decrease in income tax payable resulting from the timing of our income tax payments  vii a million increase in prepaid income taxes related to intercompany product sales  viii a million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets due to vendor prepayment requirements and tax deposits and iv a million decrease in accounts payable due to the timing of payments to our vendors 
for fiscal year  we generated approximately million of cash from investing activities 
we generated million of cash proceeds from the sale of used rental equipment and we generated million of cash proceeds from the sale of short term investments 
these cash proceeds were offset by an investment of million to expand our rental equipment fleet to meet customer demand  and a million investment in other property and equipment  including million of real property acquisitions in houston and bogot 
we estimate that our capital expenditures for rental equipment in fiscal year could be approximately million or more  excluding non cash transfers from our inventory account 
in addition  we estimate that other capital expenditures for property and equipment could be approximately million  including approximately million for the in process construction expenditures relating to the expansion of our houston manufacturing and engineering facilities 
we expect these capital expenditures will be financed from our cash on hand  internal cash flow  rental equipment sales proceeds and or from borrowings under our credit agreement 
for fiscal year  we generated approximately million of cash from financing activities 
we generated million from the exercise of stock options and related tax benefits and we borrowed million under our credit facility for working capital purposes 
such borrowings were subsequently repaid during october fiscal year at september   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
in addition  we had million of short term investments at september  for fiscal year  we generated approximately million of cash from operating activities 
the primary sources of cash generated in our operating activities resulted from net income of million 
additional sources of cash included net non cash charges of million for deferred income tax expense  depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation  inventory obsolescence and bad debts 
other sources of cash from operating activities included i a million increase in accounts payable due to increased purchases of raw materials  ii a million increase in deferred revenue resulting from an increase in the amount of advanced payments received from our customers  iii a million decrease in trade accounts and notes receivable primarily resulting from improved cash receipts from customers during fiscal year  and iv a million increase in accrued expenses and other  including a million increase in incentive compensation expenses due to increased consolidated pretax earnings 
these sources of cash were offset by i a million increase in inventories due to increasing levels of work in process resulting from known and anticipated product orders  rental equipment demands and the production of a permanent seabed acquisition for shell brasil petr leo ltda  ii a million adjustment to transfer gross profits from rental equipment sales to investing activities since such transactions involve the sale of long lived assets  and iii a million increase in prepaid income taxes related to intercompany sales 
for fiscal year  we used approximately million of cash in investing activities 
the uses of cash primarily resulted from i our investment of million for rental equipment  ii million of capital expenditures for property and equipment  and iii a million net increase in our short term investments 
in addition  we transferred million of inventories to our rental equipment during fiscal year which had a non cash impact 
the uses of cash outlined above were partially offset by million of proceeds from the sale of used rental equipment 
for fiscal year  we generated approximately million of cash in the financing activities from the exercise of stock options and related tax benefits 
fiscal year at september   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
for fiscal year  we generated approximately million of cash in operating activities 
sources of cash generated in our operating activities resulted from net income of million 
additional sources of cash included net non cash charges of million for deferred income tax benefit  depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation  inventory obsolescence and bad debts 
other sources of cash included i a million decrease in trade accounts and notes receivable primarily resulting from improved cash receipts from customers during fiscal year  ii a million increase in accrued expenses and other  primarily resulting from an increase of million for incentive compensation expenses due to increased consolidated pretax earnings  and a million increase in warranty accruals due to increased potential warranty exposure resulting from increased product sales  and iii a million increase in accounts payable due to increased purchases of raw materials 
these sources of cash were offset by i a million increase in inventories due to the replenishment of low levels of our wireless data acquisition system inventories  and increasing levels of work in process resulting from product orders and anticipated demand for wireless data acquisition system sales and rentals  ii a million adjustment to transfer gross profits from rental equipment sales to investing activities since such transactions involve the sale of long lived assets  iii a million increase in other current assets resulting from the advanced payment of income taxes in certain tax jurisdictions  iv a million decrease in income tax payable resulting from the payment of income taxes owed on our pretax profits  and v a million decrease in deferred revenue resulting from a reduction in the amount of advanced payments received from our customers 
for fiscal year  we used approximately million of cash in investing activities 
the uses of cash primarily resulted from i our investment of million for rental equipment  ii million of capital expenditures for property and equipment  and iii a million investment in short term investments 
in addition  we transferred million of inventories to our rental equipment during fiscal year which had a non cash impact 
the uses of cash outlined above were partially offset by million of proceeds from the sale of used rental equipment 
for fiscal year  we generated approximately million of cash in the financing activities of our operations 
during fiscal year  we generated million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and related tax benefits 
partially offsetting these proceeds was a million cash payment to pay off a mortgage loan obligation 
on march   we entered into a credit agreement with a bank 
on september   we amended the credit agreement and increased the borrowing availability to million as amended  the credit agreement 
our borrowings are principally secured by our accounts receivable  inventories and equipment 
in addition  certain of our domestic subsidiaries have guaranteed our obligations under the credit agreement and such subsidiaries have secured the obligations by the pledge of certain of the assets of such subsidiaries 
the credit agreement expires on april  and all borrowed funds are due and payable at that time 
we are required to make quarterly interest payments on borrowed funds 
the credit agreement limits the incurrence of additional indebtedness  requires the maintenance of certain financial ratios  restricts us and our subsidiaries ability to pay cash dividends and contains other covenants customary in agreements of this type 
the interest rate for borrowings under the credit agreement is a libor based rate with a margin spread of basis points depending upon the maintenance of certain ratios 
at september   we were in compliance with all covenants 
at september  and  there were borrowings of million and zero  respectively  outstanding under the credit agreement 
there were standby letters of credit outstanding in the amount of  and additional borrowings available were million 
please see risk factors for more information about the restrictive covenants imposed on us by the credit agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any obligations which meet the definition of an off balance sheet arrangement and which have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial statements or the items contained therein that are material to investors 
contractual obligations for information regarding our contractual obligations over the course of the next five years  please refer to note and note to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report  which provide detailed information regarding repayment of our credit agreement and an operating lease 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
we consider many factors in selecting appropriate operational and financial accounting policies and controls  and in developing the estimates and assumptions that are used in the preparation of these financial statements 
we continually evaluate our estimates  including those related to percentage of completion revenue recognition  bad debt reserves  inventory obsolescence reserves  self insurance reserves for medical expenses  product warranty reserves  intangible assets  stock based compensation and deferred income tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other factors  including the impact from the current economic conditions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or assumptions 
our normal credit terms for trade receivables are days 
in certain situations  credit terms for trade receivables may be extended to days or longer and such receivables generally do not require collateral 
additionally  we provide long term financing in the form of promissory notes when competitive conditions require such financing and  in such cases  we may require collateral 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers accounts and notes receivable and allowances are recognized for potential credit losses 
our long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable 
the impairment review  if necessary  includes a comparison of expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges to be generated by an asset group with the associated carrying value of the related assets 
if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the expected future cash flows  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value 
management makes judgments regarding the interpretation of tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and causes changes to previous estimates of tax liability 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions as well as by the internal revenue service 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all open tax years 
the potential outcomes of examinations are regularly assessed in determining the adequacy of the provision for income taxes and income tax liabilities 
management believes that adequate provisions have been made for reasonable and foreseeable outcomes related to uncertain tax matters 
we record a write down of our inventories when the cost basis of any manufactured product  including any estimated future costs to complete the manufacturing process  exceeds its net realizable value 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined on a first in  first out method  except that our subsidiary in the russian federation uses an average cost method to value its inventories 
we periodically review the composition of our inventories to determine if market demand  product modifications  technology changes  excessive quantities on hand and other factors hinder our ability to recover its investment in such inventories 
management s assessment is based upon historical product demand  estimated future product demand and various other judgments and estimates 
inventory obsolescence reserves are recorded when such assessments reveal that portions or components of our inventory investment will not be realized in our operating activities 
we primarily derive revenue from the sale and short term rental under operating leases  of products 
our products are produced in a standard manufacturing operation 
we recognize revenue from product sales when i title passes to the customer  ii the customer assumes risks and rewards of ownership  iii the product sales price has been determined  iv collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured  and v product delivery occurs as directed by our customer 
we recognize rental revenues as earned over the rental period 
rentals of our equipment generally range from daily rentals to rental periods of up to six months or longer 
service revenues are recognized when services are rendered and are generally priced on a per day rate 
except for certain of our reservoir characterization products  our products are generally sold without any customer acceptance provisions and our standard terms of sale do not allow customers to return products for credit 
we utilize the percentage of completion method the poc method to recognize revenues and costs on future contracts having the following characteristics the contract requires significant custom designs for customer specific applications  the product design requires significant engineering efforts  the contract requires the customer to make progress payments during the contract term  and  the contract requires at least days of engineering and manufacturing effort 
the poc method will require our senior management to make estimates  at least quarterly  of the i total costs of the contract  ii manufacturing progress against the contract  and iii the estimated cost to complete the contract 
these estimates will impact the amount of revenue and gross profit we will recognize for each reporting period 
significant estimates that may affect future cost to complete a contract include the cost and availability of raw materials and component parts  engineering services  manufacturing equipment  labor  manufacturing capacity  factory productivity  contract penalties and disputes  product warranties and other contingent factors 
the cumulative impact of periodic revisions to the future cost to complete a contract will be reflected in the period in which these changes become known  including  to the extent required  the recognition of losses at the time such losses are known and estimable on contracts in progress 
due to the various estimates inherent in the poc method  actual results could differ from those estimates 
most of our products do not require installation assistance or sophisticated instruction 
we offer a standard product warranty  which obligates us to repair or replace equipment with manufacturing defects 
we maintain a reserve for future warranty costs based on historical experience or  in the absence of historical experience  management estimates 
forward looking statements and assumptions this annual report on form k and the documents incorporated by reference herein  if any  contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these forward looking statements can be identified by terminology such as may  will  should  intend  expect  plan  budget  forecast  anticipate  believe  estimate  predict  potential  continue  evaluating or similar words 
statements that contain these words should be read carefully because they discuss our future expectations  contain projections of our future results of operations or of our financial position or state other forward looking information 
examples of forward looking statements include  among others  statements that we make regarding our expected operating results  the adoption and sale of our products in various geographic regions  anticipated levels of capital expenditures and the sources of funding therefore  and our strategy for growth  product development  market position  financial results and reserves 
these forward looking statements reflect our best judgment about future events and trends based on the information currently available to us 
however  there will likely be events in the future that we are not able to predict or control 
the factors listed under the caption risk factors  as well as cautionary language in this annual report on form k  provide examples of risks  uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward looking statements 
you should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial position  and actual events and results of operations may vary materially from our current expectations 
management s current outlook and assumptions our estimates as to future results and industry trends  to the extent described in this document  are primarily based on assumptions regarding the future level of seismic exploration activity and seismic reservoir monitoring projects  and in turn  their effect on the demand and pricing of our products and services 
our analysis of the market and its impact on us is based upon the following assumptions while crude oil prices have stabilized over the last three years  we believe the impact of the sovereign debt and austerity issues in europe  slower economic growth in the us and china and the resulting recessionary fears  combined with potentially volatile and unsteady energy commodity prices may constrain oil and gas exploration activities in north america and also in certain international markets 
the uncertainty of these global economic matters and their ultimate impact on energy commodity prices and on exploration activities may cause demand for our seismic exploration products to decrease 
we believe the impact of political conditions and hostilities around the world  including those in north africa and the middle east  which may impact oil and gas commodity prices  will not cause a significant increase or decrease in demand for our seismic products for the foreseeable future 
during fiscal year  we recognized revenues of million related to our permanent reservoir monitoring systems  with such revenues representing of our consolidated revenues during fiscal year we expect to complete manufacturing of the statoil order in mid fiscal year and  therefore  we expect to recognize the remaining statoil order revenues of million during fiscal year if we do not receive new large orders for our permanent reservoir monitoring systems prior to our expected completion of the statoil order in mid fiscal year  we expect revenues and profits from our reservoir products to decline significantly during fiscal year as a result of distribution infrastructure bottlenecks in key crude oil producing areas in north america combined with declining demand for crude oil in the united states  we expect demand for new seismic data and  consequently  demand for many of our traditional seismic products in north america could be challenged in fiscal year despite these market conditions  based on orders we have already received in the first quarter of fiscal year  we expect fiscal year sales and rentals of our land and marine wireless products to increase significantly over fiscal year levels 
we believe this growth will come from i the continued transition from cabled systems to wireless systems by our existing customers  ii the addition of new international customers and iii acceptance by the industry of our new obx marine wireless system 
some of our traditional seismic products are characterized as low margin commodity products with intense international competition 
sales levels for these products have been relatively flat or declining since fiscal year and we do not expect sales levels for these lower margin products to grow during fiscal year as we focus our product development and production activities toward higher margin specialty products and new technologies  especially our wireless and reservoir products  we expect sales of these lower margin traditional seismic products to decline in the future 
seismic equipment rentals were less than of our fiscal year consolidated revenues 
rental revenues are primarily derived from short term lease of our land and marine wireless products and  to a lesser extent  from our traditional and reservoir products 
we expect strong customer demand for rental equipment in fiscal year and  therefore  we plan to significantly expand our rental equipment fleet 
as a result  we expect rental revenues from our seismic products to increase significantly over fiscal year levels 
we expect sales of our non seismic products  including our industrial products  offshore cables and thermal printing equipment and film to increase marginally over fiscal year levels 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have market risk relative to sensitive instruments entered into for trading purposes and have only very limited risk as to arrangements entered into other than for trading purposes 
we do not engage in commodity or commodity derivative instrument purchase or sales transactions 
because of the inherent unpredictability of foreign currency rates and interest rates  as well as other factors  actual results could differ materially from those projected in this item a 
foreign currency and operations risk one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  geospace technologies eurasia  is located in the russian federation 
in addition  another of our wholly owned subsidiaries  geospace technologies sucursal sudamericana  is located in colombia 
our financial results for these entities may be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  weak economic conditions  or changes in the political climate 
our consolidated balance sheet at september  reflected approximately million and million of net working capital related to our russian and colombian operations  respectively 
both of these entities receive a portion of their revenues and pay a majority of their expenses primarily in their local currency 
to the extent that transactions of these entities are settled in their local currency  a devaluation of these currencies versus the us dollar could reduce any contribution from these entities to our consolidated results of operations and total comprehensive income as reported in us dollars 
we do not hedge the market risk with respect to our operations in these countries  therefore  such risk is a general and unpredictable risk of future disruptions in the valuation of such currencies versus us dollars to the extent such disruptions result in any reduced valuation of these foreign entities net working capital or future contributions to our consolidated results of operations 
at september   the foreign exchange rate for one us dollar was equal to russian rubles and  colombian pesos  respectively 
if the value of the us dollar were to decline by ten percent against these foreign currencies  our working capital in the russian federation and colombia could decline by million and  respectively 
foreign currency intercompany accounts and notes receivable from time to time  we provide access to capital to our foreign subsidiaries through us dollar denominated interest bearing promissory notes 
such funds are generally used by our foreign subsidiaries to purchase capital assets and for general working capital needs 
in addition  we sell products to our foreign subsidiaries on trade credit terms in both us dollars and in the subsidiary s local currency 
because we have intercompany debts denominated in foreign currencies  any appreciation or devaluation of such foreign currencies against the us dollar will result in a gain or loss  respectively  to our consolidated statement of operations 
at september   we had outstanding intercompany accounts receivable of million from our canadian subsidiary which are denominated in canadian dollars 
we entered into an agreement with a united states bank to hedge million of this foreign exchange exposure  resulting in a net canadian dollar denominated intercompany accounts payable exposure to the us dollar of million at september  at september   the foreign exchange rate for one us dollar was equal to canadian dollars 
if the us dollar exchange rate were to strengthen by ten percent against the canadian dollar  we would recognize a foreign exchange loss of million in our consolidated financial statements 
floating interest rate risk the credit agreement contains a floating interest rate  which subjects us to the risk of increased interest costs associated with any upward movements in bank market interest rates 
under the credit agreement our borrowing interest rate is a libor based rate plus basis points 
the interest rate at september  was 
as of september  and  we had million and zero  respectively  borrowed under the credit agreement 
at september  based on our current level of borrowings  a increase in interest rates would increase interest expense annually by approximately
