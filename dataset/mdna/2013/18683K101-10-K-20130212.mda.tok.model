item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and other factors that may affect our future results 
overview cliffs natural resources inc traces its corporate history back to today  we are an international mining and natural resources company 
a member of the s p index  we are a major global iron ore producer and a significant producer of high and low volatile metallurgical coal 
our company s operations are organized according to product category and geographic location us iron ore  eastern canadian iron ore  asia pacific iron ore  north american coal  latin american iron ore  ferroalloys and our global exploration group 

table of contents we have been executing a strategy designed to achieve scale in the mining industry and focused on serving the world s largest and fastest growing steel markets 
in the us  we operate five iron ore mines in michigan and minnesota  five metallurgical coal mines located in west virginia and alabama  and one thermal coal mine located in west virginia 
we also operate two iron ore mines in eastern canada 
our asia pacific operations consist solely of our koolyanobbing iron ore mining complex in western australia as of december  our percent equity interest in cockatoo island  an iron ore mine  and our percent economic interest in sonoma  a coking and thermal coal mine  also were included in these operations through their sale dates in the third and fourth quarters  respectively 
in latin america  we have a percent interest in amap  a brazilian iron ore operation  the sale of which our board approved in december  and  in ontario  canada  we have a major chromite project that advanced to the feasibility study stage of development in may of in addition  our global exploration group is focused on early involvement in exploration activities to identify new world class projects for future development or projects that add significant value to existing operations 
our capital allocation strategy is designed to prioritize all potential uses of future cash flows in a manner that is most meaningful for shareholders 
while we plan on using future cash flows to reduce debt over time  we also intend to deploy capital to finance organic growth 
maintaining financial flexibility as commodity pricing changes throughout the business cycle is imperative to our ability to execute our strategic initiatives 
the key driver of our business is global demand for steelmaking raw materials in both developed and emerging economies  with china and the us representing the two largest markets for our company 
in  china produced approximately million metric tons of crude steel  or approximately percent of total global crude steel production  whereas the us produced approximately million metric tons of crude steel  or about percent of total crude steel production 
these figures represent an approximate percent and percent increase in crude steel production over  respectively 
global crude steel production continued to grow in  despite facing challenging economic headwinds  including a decreased year over year pace of economic growth and political uncertainty in china  as well as the widely reported fiscal issues in both the us and the european union 
as a result  these challenges resulted in a volatile pricing environment for steelmaking raw materials  which directly impacted our performance 
during  we expect year over year steel production to rise in both the us and in china 
china growth will be predicated on continued urbanization and the consequent demand for housing and durable goods 
in the us  steel demand is expected to increase due to a steadily recovering housing market and improving demand for automotive products 
in addition  domestic steel demand should benefit from increased investment in the oil and gas industry 
we continue to expect that chinese steel production will outpace the growth in chinese iron ore production  which will face increasing production costs due primarily to diminishing iron ore grades and rising wages 
chinese iron ore  while abundant  is a lower grade containing less than half of the equivalent iron ore content than ore supplied by australia and brazil 
the global price of iron ore is influenced heavily by chinese demand  and the decrease in of spot market prices reflected economic growth in china  weakened demand from europe  global political uncertainty and supply of new iron ore 
iron ore spot prices stabilized in the fourth quarter at a level well above historical averages  indicating that global iron ore demand continues to outpace global iron ore supply 
the world market benchmark that is most commonly utilized in our sales contracts is the platts percent fe fines pricing  which has reflected this trend 
the platts percent fe fines spot price decreased percent to an average price of per ton in the spot price volatility impacts our realized revenue rates  particularly in our eastern canadian iron ore and asia pacific iron ore business segments as the related contracts are correlated heavily to world benchmark spot pricing 
however  the impact of this volatility on our us iron ore revenues is muted slightly because the pricing in our long term contracts is mostly structured to be based on month averages ending august  with some including contracts that established annual price collars 
additionally  contracts often are priced partially or completely on other indices instead of world benchmark prices 

table of contents during  capacity utilization among north american steelmaking facilities improved to an average annual rate of about percent when compared to the average annual rate of percent in  despite diminishing capacity in the latter half of the year 
both the automotive industry and the growth of the shale gas industry supported us steel demand in  providing sources of healthy demand for our products 
metallurgical coal prices are influenced heavily by european  japanese and chinese demand  which all declined from levels reached in the decline in demand resulted in decreased low volatile hard coking coal spot prices from an average of per ton in to an average of per ton in the spot price volatility impacts our realized revenue rates for our north american coal business segment 
our consolidated revenues for the year ended december  decreased to billion  with net loss from continuing operations per diluted share of 
this compares with revenues of billion  with net income from continuing operations per diluted share of  for the comparable period in revenues during the year ended december  were impacted primarily by the decrease in market pricing throughout in comparison to the historically high prices of earnings were adversely impacted by impairment charges  establishment of valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets and higher spending  which were partially offset by total increased iron ore and coal sales volumes at most of our operations around the world 
growth strategy through a number of strategic acquisitions executed over recent years  we have increased significantly our portfolio of assets  enhancing our production profile and growth project pipeline 
our capital allocation strategy is designed to prioritize among all potential uses of future cash flows in a manner that is most meaningful for shareholders 
we plan on using future cash flows to develop organic growth projects and to reduce debt over time 
maintaining financial flexibility as commodity pricing changes throughout the business cycle is imperative to our ability to execute our strategic initiatives 
as we continue to expand our operating scale and geographic presence as an international mining and natural resources company  we have shifted our strategy from a merger and acquisition based strategy to one that primarily focuses on organic growth and expansion initiatives 
our focus is investing in the expansion of our seaborne iron ore production capabilities driven by our belief in the constructive long term outlook for the seaborne iron ore market 
throughout  we continued to make investments in bloom lake  our large scale seaborne iron ore growth project in eastern canada 
maximizing bloom lake production capabilities represents an opportunity to create significant shareholder value 
we expect the phase ii expansion at bloom lake to meaningfully enhance our future earnings and cash flow generation by increasing sales volume and reducing unit operating costs 
our production ramp up has made meaningful progress  despite some of the operational challenges experienced during the year 
in  we also made significant progress in the construction of bloom lake phase ii concentrator mill 
despite this progress  the year volatile pricing environment drove us to delay components of phase ii construction activities and planned startup date 
we also own additional development properties  known as labrador trough south located in quebec  that potentially could allow us to leverage parts of our existing infrastructure in eastern canada to supply additional iron ore into the seaborne market in future years if developed 
our chromite project  located in northern ontario  represents an attractive diversification opportunity for us 
we advanced the project to the feasibility study stage of development in may of we expect to build further on the technical and economic evaluations developed in the prefeasibility study stage and improve the accuracy of cost estimates to assess the economic viability of the project  which work is necessary before we can advance to the execution stage of the project 
in addition to this large greenfield project  our global exploration group expects to achieve additional growth through early involvement in exploration and development activities by partnering with junior mining companies in various parts of the world 
this potentially provides us with low cost entry points to increase significantly our reserve base and growth production profile 

table of contents recent developments maintaining financial flexibility and preserving our investment grade credit profile are important elements of our strategy to resume the phase ii expansion at bloom lake 
our strategic emphasis on financial flexibility and our investment grade credit ratings is driven by recent volatility in iron ore prices and the capital intensive nature of the phase ii expansion combined with the increased mining development costs we expect during construction 
we believe that by reducing debt  lowering our dividend to enable investing the majority of our future cash flows in the phase ii expansion  solidifying access to our primary source of liquidity  disposing of non core assets and refinancing near term debt maturities  we will be in a strong position to resume the phase ii expansion and accelerate the realization of bloom lake significant earnings potential 
our board of directors recently approved a reduction to our quarterly cash dividend rate by percent to per share 
our board of directors took this step in order to improve the future cash flows available for investment in the phase ii expansion at bloom lake  as well as to preserve our investment grade credit ratings 
on february   we received unanimous support from our lenders to suspend the total funded debt to ebitda leverage ratio for all quarterly reporting periods in within the amendment we will add temporarily a total capitalization and minimum tangible net worth covenant during these periods 
we believe this proactive measure provides financial flexibility as we invest in the phase ii expansion at bloom lake and reinforces our commitment to maintaining an investment grade credit rating 
it also demonstrates the favorable relationships and transparency we have with our lenders 
on december   our board of directors authorized the sale of our percent interest in the amap joint venture located in brazil 
during this process  we made a determination that the value of our amap interest needed to be adjusted to reflect the fair value of our investment 
subsequently  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million in our december  financial statements 
by disposing of our interest in amap  we eliminated the potential for incurring further losses there and enabled us to focus the investment of future cash flows on the phase ii expansion at bloom lake 
on december   we successfully raised million dollars in public senior notes with an annual interest rate of percent and a maturity date in we used the net proceeds to pay off million in private placement notes  which were higher cost and maturing in and we used the remainder of the net proceeds to pay down a portion of our revolving credit facility and term loan 
on november   we announced that we finalized the sale of our percent economic interest in the sonoma coal mine located in queensland  australia to our joint venture partners 
we divested our interests in the sonoma mine along with our ownership of the affiliated wash plant 
we received approximately aud million in net cash proceeds upon the close of the transaction

sales margin for us iron ore was million for the year ended december   compared with a sales margin of  million for the year ended december  the decline compared to the prior year is attributable to a decrease in revenue of million  offset by a slight decrease in cost of goods sold and operating expenses of million 
a decrease in revenue of million for the year ended december  was a result of a decreased sales price due to changes in the market  as previously discussed  compared to the prior year period 
the decrease in revenue also was impacted by the arcelormittal usa price re opener settlement  which caused revenue to increase million in additionally  the algoma nomination sales price true up arbitration agreement resulted in an additional million of revenue in our realized sales price during the year ended december  was an average decrease per ton of percent over the same period in  or an average decrease per ton of percent  excluding the impact of the arbitration settlements 
sales volumes decreased by million in over the same period in primarily due to lower year over year domestic demand  the majority of the decline resulting from specific customer financial difficulties 
we have not delivered this tonnage in the export market  due to reductions in market pricing 
cost of goods sold and operating expenses in decreased million  excluding the increase of million of freight and reimbursements from the prior year  predominantly as a result of lower sales volumes that resulted in decreased costs of million compared to the comparable prior year period 
partially offset by increased costs of million in our pellet operation primarily caused by increased production costs which was mainly triggered by higher labor costs of million driven by pension  opeb and profit sharing rate increases and an increase of million related to mine development at our michigan operations 
the increased costs were offset partially by the sale of fines at our michigan operations 
production four of the five us iron ore mines primarily operated at full capacity during the year ended december  to ensure that we were positioned to meet customer demand 
as previously announced  we curtailed production at the empire mine near the end of the second quarter of as a result of decreased demand by one of our customers that resulted in a decrease in empire production of percent during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  production at empire resumed late in the third quarter of 
table of contents during the year ended december   our northshore mine production was impacted negatively by unforeseen power outages as well as infrastructure failures due to storms that resulted in a decrease in northshore s production of percent during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  as previously announced  two of the four production lines at northshore were idled beginning january  we will additionally temporarily idle production at the empire mine beginning in the second quarter of in the form of an extended summer shutdown

we reported sales margin loss for eastern canadian iron ore of million for the year ended december   compared with a sales margin of million for the year ended december  the reduction  compared with the same period last year  is attributable to lower realized sales price while experiencing increased costs 
eastern canadian iron ore sold million metric tons during the year ended december  compared with million metric tons last year 
this increase in sales volume is attributable directly to million metric tons of incremental sales in due to the acquisition of consolidated thompson in may  resulting in million of additional sales volume revenue for the year ended december  the increased sales volumes provided through the acquisition were offset partially by lower sales volumes at wabush due to reduced customer nominations and production shortfalls associated with equipment failure downtime during the year ended december  this resulted in a reduction of revenue of million compared to the year ended december  in addition  sales price decreased by million when compared to the eastern canadian iron ore realized sales price was  on average  a percent decrease per metric ton  primarily due to a decrease in the platts benchmark pricing  as previously discussed  compared to the same period in although sales price has had the most significant impact on our revenues  we also sold a higher mix of concentrate product  which generally realizes a lower sales price than iron ore pellets 
higher cost of goods sold and operating expenses during the year ended december  increased from the same period last year by million primarily due to significant increase in sales volume as a result of the acquisition of consolidated thompson in may  resulting in million of additional cost for the year ended december   partially offset by lower wabush pellet sales volumes  which resulted in lower costs of million compared to the same period in increased costs of million in our concentrate operation primarily caused by increased production costs  which were mainly triggered by higher spending of million on 
table of contents contractors and repairs and maintenance  an increase of million caused by higher mine development and million of increased rail transportation charges 
increased costs of million in our pellet operation primarily caused by increased production costs  which were mainly triggered by higher spending of million on contractors and repairs and maintenance  an increase of million caused by lower concentrator throughput and million of increased energy costs 
the year over year cost increase was offset partially by the non recurring adjustment recorded in in which we amortized an additional million of stepped up value of inventory that resulted from the purchase accounting for the acquisition of consolidated thompson 
production the increase in production levels over the comparable prior year period is the result of the incremental tonnage available from the bloom lake operations from our acquisition of consolidated thompson in may offset by decreased production at wabush 
bloom lake produced million metric tons of iron ore concentrate during the year ended december  compared to million metric tons in our ownership period in production at wabush declined to million metric tons of iron ore pellets in compared to million metric tons during the prior year as a result of lower throughput due to challenging ore characterization and operational issues that have resulted in downtime for maintenance and repairs during the year ended december   as compared to the prior year 
as a component of the long term commercial marketing strategy for bloom lake mine  we have determined that producing a premium  higher grade iron ore concentrate is expected to position the mine to achieve greater profitability for the longer term based on current market demands 
the process of producing a premium  higher grade product impacts the overall iron ore recovery rate  requiring a lower actual production rate for the mine  but is expected to increase operational stability 
our previously stated annual production expectation for bloom lake phase i was million tons per year 
based on the operating adjustments required to achieve the premium  higher grade product  we now expect the annual production capacity for phase i of bloom lake mine to be approximately million tons 
as previously announced  at the bloom lake mine we are delaying certain components of the phase ii expansion  including the completion of the concentrator and load out facility 
several other projects designed to support both phase i and phase ii are continuing as planned 
these projects include pre stripping mine development  an overland conveyor system  an in pit crusher and tailing and water management infrastructure 
depending on market conditions  we expect to complete phase ii construction in

cockatoo island production and sales reflects our percent share 
sales margin for asia pacific iron ore decreased to million during the year ended december  compared with million for revenue decreased in primarily as a result of a decrease in the platts market benchmark pricing for iron ore in comparison to and was offset partially by higher sales volume 
the change in our realized price for the year ended december  compared to was on average a percent and percent decrease per metric ton for our standard lump and fines  respectively 
additionally  due to limited standard grade ore product availability during  we processed and shipped low grade iron ore product 
during the year ended december   we shipped approximately million metric tons of low grade iron ore 
the average realized price for the low grade iron ore was approximately percent lower than the sales price of our standard iron ore sold during the year ended december  sales volume during the year ended december  increased to million metric tons compared with million metric tons in  resulting in an increase in revenue of million 
increased port and rail capacity made available through the completion of our koolyanobbing expansion project allowed more tonnage to be shipped 
these shipments included an additional million metric tons of standard lump and fines and million metric tons of low grade iron ore product in over the prior year 
cost of goods sold and operating expenses in increased million compared to primarily as a result of higher sales volumes resulting in higher costs of million compared to prior year 
higher mining costs of million mainly attributable to increased volume and stripping costs and higher logistic costs of million due to higher haulage and railed tons compared to the prior year period 
higher depreciation costs of million mainly attributable to increased fixed assets related to the koolyanobbing expansion project 
partially offset by lower royalties of million and lower cockatoo island mining costs in of million due to the winding down of stage mining 

table of contents production production at asia pacific iron ore increased by percent in when compared to the completion of the koolyanobbing expansion project provided additional ore processing and rail and port capabilities that drove this performance increase 
koolyanobbing production increased percent which included approximately million metric tons of low grade iron ore during the year ended december  we completed the mining of stage iii and sold our interest in cockatoo island at the end of the third quarter of which resulted in a decrease of percent in total production during compared to north american coal following is a summary of north american coal results for the years ended december  and in millions change due to year ended december  sales price and rate sales volume idle cost production volume variance freight and reimbursement total change revenues from product sales and services cost of goods sold and operating expenses sales margin sales tons production tons tons are short tons  pounds 
sales margin for north american coal increased to a loss of million during the year ended december   compared to the loss of million in revenue during the year ended december  increased percent over the prior year period to million primarily due to higher sales volumes during north american coal sold million tons during the year ended december  compared with million tons last year resulting in an increase in revenue of million 
increased inventory availability and sales volume in was a result of the operational issues at pinnacle mine and tornado damage at oak grove mine  plus strong production performance in compared to the prior year

cost of goods sold and operating expenses in increased million  excluding the increase of million of freight and reimbursements from the prior year  predominantly as a result of higher sales volume attributable to additional low volatile metallurgical coal sales  as discussed above  resulting in a cost increase of million 
increase in costs due to a million lcm inventory write down primarily driven by a softening market in both low and high volatility metallurgical coal 
during the year ended december   fixed costs of million being recorded as idle costs as there were operational issues caused by carbon monoxide at the pinnacle mine and the effects of the april tornado at oak grove mine  which both resulted in temporary production curtailments 
these fixed costs would be included in the rate during as we did not experience similar temporary production curtailments 

table of contents production increased low volatile metallurgical coal production levels in were achieved at the pinnacle and oak grove mines 
pinnacle mine s increased production of percent compared to the prior year is a result of positive longwall production performance during the current year and depressed production in the prior year due to elevated carbon monoxide levels 
oak grove mine s production levels for the year ended december  increased by percent due mainly to the installation of a new longwall shearer during additionally  oak grove mine s preparation plant was impacted negatively by the effects of the april tornado 
the production levels at the oak grove preparation plant resumed operating at partial capacity in january and reached normal operating levels during april high volatile metallurgical coal production levels at clcc in remained consistent in comparison to during  we experienced a decline in the demand for thermal coal used in power generation 
accordingly  on june   we reduced production at our thermal mine to one shift to align production with customer requirements and existing supply agreements

sales margin for us iron ore was billion for  compared with a sales margin of million for the improvement over was attributable to an increase in revenue of billion  offset partially by an increase in cost of goods sold and operating expenses of million 
the increase in revenue was a result of improvements in sales prices and volumes  as well as the arcelormittal usa price re opener settlement  which caused revenue to increase million  million and million  respectively  over the increase in sales price was driven by higher market pricing during sales prices realized at us iron ore were positively impacted by the industry s shift toward shorter term pricing arrangements linked to the spot market and by sales tons to seaborne customers at market based rates 
historically  us iron ore has not provided sales tons to seaborne customers 
we provided million sales tons to seaborne customers in compared to million sales tons in in addition  revenue in included million related to supplemental contract payments compared with million in the overall increase between years relates to the estimated rise in average annual hot band steel pricing for one of our us iron ore customers 
as previously disclosed  we reached a negotiated settlement with arcelormittal usa in april with respect to our previously disclosed arbitrations and litigation regarding price re opener entitlements for and and pellet nominations for and the financial results for the first half of included million of the price re opener settlement  with an additional million recognized during the latter half of upon the shipment of additional tons under the pellet nomination

our realized sales price during was an average increase per ton of percent over  or an increase per ton of percent excluding the impact of the arbitration settlement with arcelormittal usa 
the increase in sales volume was partially due to thousand tons related to a subsidiary of arcelormittal usa s noncontrolling interest in the empire mining venture that has been prospectively recognized through product revenue 
in addition  sales volumes increased during due to increases in customer demand that were driven primarily by increased blast furnace utilization rates at several of our customer locations  and due to incremental sales volumes that also were recognized over due to sales tons to seaborne customers during the period  as discussed earlier 
we also recognized million of additional revenue on a customer shipment as the related payments were made in the fourth quarter of  compared to the fourth quarter of shipments for the same customer that were not recognized due to the timing of cash receipts 
these increases during were offset partially when comparing to by thousand carryover tons from that were recognized as sales in due to timing of shipments 
cost of goods sold and operating expenses in increased million from the prior year predominantly as a result of higher cost rates of million during primarily due to increased mining costs of million  higher spending for maintenance and repair projects of million  increased depreciation of million and  higher energy rates of million  offset partially by improved cost leverage driving down the cost rate by million at some of our mines as production volume increased and by the liquidation of million of previous lifo layers that were at lower rates

cockatoo island production and sales reflects our percent share 
sales margin for asia pacific iron ore increased to million during compared with million in revenue increased percent in primarily as a result of higher lump and fines iron ore prices 
in  the world s largest iron ore producers moved away from the annual international benchmark pricing mechanism referenced in our customer supply agreements  resulting in a shift in the industry toward shorter term pricing arrangements linked to the spot market 
as previously discussed  we renegotiated the terms of our supply agreements with our chinese and japanese asia pacific iron ore customers moving to shorter term pricing mechanisms of various durations based on the average daily spot prices  with certain pricing mechanisms that have a duration of up to a quarter 
this change was effective in the first quarter of for our chinese customers and the second quarter of for our japanese customers 
we finalized quarterly pricing arrangements with our asia pacific iron ore customers during the second quarter of the increase in our realized price for over was on average a percent and percent increase per wet metric ton for lump and fines  respectively 
pricing settlements in reflect the increase in steel demand and spot prices for iron ore 
in addition  sales prices increased during due to the sale of approximately thousand additional metric tons of premium fines produced at cockatoo island during the period 
sales volume during decreased to million metric tons compared with million metric tons for the prior year  resulting in decrease in revenue of million 
the lower sales volume was driven by a planned extended shutdown of the esperance port as part of the million metric ton per year expansion project and third party labor disputes at both port and rail facilities that were settled in july and november  respectively 
these events impacted shipments during and caused shipment timing delays from december into january the decrease in sales volume was offset partially by higher sales from our cockatoo island mine 
cockatoo island sales volumes were lower in the prior year as the mine production was resumed during the third quarter of cost of goods sold and operating expenses in increased million compared with primarily as a result of million of cost increases mainly related to cost increases of million during due to increases in fuel prices and increases in mining costs as a result of increases in waste mining volumes  mining costs for cockatoo island up million over the prior year given the resumed mine production during third quarter of  royalty costs also increased million during  as a result of increased revenue  processing costs were higher by million in primarily due to increases in fuel prices and maintenance costs compared to and  
table of contents offset partially by inventory movement of million during  due to a reduction in inventory in from the utilization of long term stock piles and an increase in inventory in million related to unfavorable foreign exchange rate variances 
these costs were offset partially by million due to lower sales volume during production production at asia pacific iron ore decreased slightly in when compared to due to a seven day shutdown of the ore handling plant in the fourth quarter of in order to replenish run of mine stocks  combined with poor weather conditions at koolyanobbing in january of  including severe wet weather and a tropical storm

the additional clcc sales tons resulted in million of additional revenue in when compared to this increase in volume was offset partially by lower availability of coal at our pinnacle and oak grove locations given carbon monoxide levels and significant tornado damage  respectively  that impacted production during  and market softening for clcc s high volatile metallurgical coal 
volume also was negatively affected by severe shipping congestion caused by demand for export metallurgical coal shipped from port facilities in virginia and the lack of rail car availability due to supply constraints related to increases in demand experienced during the first quarter of the sales volume decreases at these locations resulted in lower revenues of million over in addition  sales prices increased by million when compared to  reflecting increases in our contract prices as a result of high steel demand and the associated raw material prices 
these sale price increases were offset partially by a change in the sales mix from the clcc acquisition to higher percentages of lower priced high volatile  metallurgical grade coal and thermal coal 

table of contents cost of goods sold and operating expenses in increased million or percent from the prior year  primarily due to significant increase in sales volume attributable to the acquisition of clcc  which resulted in a cost increase of million

oak grove production levels in were negatively impacted by the significant tornado damage to the above ground operations in april and ventilation issues in september that resulted in reduced longwall run rates 
despite the significant tornado damage at oak grove  the mine s underground operations continued to run in anticipation of the preparation plant restart 
the preparation plant achieved partial operating capacity in january the underground operations during mined million tons of raw coal which has been stockpiled on site  or thousand tons of clean coal equivalent 
pinnacle s production during the year was also impacted by a longwall move during february and march  lower belt availability and electrical problems during april  and the suspension of operations at pinnacle due to elevated levels of carbon monoxide in may in june  we announced that regulatory agencies denied our plan designed to address the detected levels of carbon monoxide at pinnacle 
the continuous miners at pinnacle were permitted to resume operations in july and longwall operations were permitted to resume at the end of september pinnacle s production returned to conventional levels as evidenced by producing thousand tons of its million total production tons during the fourth quarter of production at the green ridge no 
mine recommenced in january from the idling and was once again idled in january liquidity  cash flows and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operating and financing activities 
cash flows from operating activities vary with prices realized from iron ore and coal sales  our sales volumes  production costs  inventory levels  income taxes  other working capital changes and other factors 
throughout  we implemented a new strategic capital allocation process that is focused on prioritizing all potential uses of future operating cash flows to maximize shareholder returns 
based on current mine plans and subject to future iron ore and coal prices and demand  we expect estimated operating cash flows and cash flows from investing that generate an inflow in to be less than our budgeted capital expenditures  expected debt payments  dividends and other cash requirements 
however  we maintain adequate liquidity via financing arrangements to fund our normal business operations and strategic initiatives 
we continue to evaluate funding options for our capital needs 
based on current 
table of contents market conditions  we expect to be able to fund these requirements through operations  the availability of credit or debt issuances under our existing financing arrangements  or the pursuit of other funding options  which may include new lines of credit or other financing arrangements that are dependent upon our ability to access credit or the capital markets 
refer to outlook for additional guidance regarding expected future results  including projections on pricing  sales volume and production for our various businesses 
the following discussion summarizes the significant activities impacting our cash flows during the year as well as those expected to impact our future cash flows over the next months 
refer to the statements of consolidated cash flows for additional information 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to  million for the same period in operating cash flows during primarily were impacted by significantly lower year over year iron ore pricing  higher year over year operating costs and by the timing of tax payments 
operating activities in were impacted positively due to the cash receipts of a million payment in april from arcelormittal to true up pricing for pellet volumes delivered to certain arcelormittal steelmaking facilities in north america during both and and a million payment from algoma to true up the portion of revenues from pellet sales that previously was disputed throughout such receipts did not occur during our long term outlook remains stable and we are focusing on our growth projects with sustained investment in our core businesses 
throughout  capacity utilization among steelmaking facilities in north america remained steady 
we expect modest growth from the us economy  sustaining a healthy business in the us crude steel production and iron ore imports in asia continue to generate demand for our products in the seaborne market 
we are continually monitoring the economic environment in which we operate in an effort to take advantage of opportunities presented by the markets for our commodity driven business 
based on current mine plans and subject to future iron ore and coal prices  we expect estimated operating cash flows in to be less than our budgeted investments and capital expenditures  expected debt payments  dividends and other cash requirements 
refer to outlook for additional guidance regarding expected future results  including projections on pricing  sales volume and production for our various businesses 
our us operations and our financing arrangements provide sufficient liquidity and  consequently  we do not need to repatriate earnings from our foreign operations  however  if we repatriated these earnings  we would be subject to income tax 
our us cash and cash equivalents balance at december  was million  or approximately percent of our consolidated total cash and cash equivalents balance of million 
historically  we have been able to raise additional capital through private financings and public debt and equity offerings  the bulk of which  to date  have been us based 
additionally  as of december  and december   we had available borrowing capacity of million and billion  respectively  under our billion us based revolving credit facility due to current covenant restrictions 
if the demand from the us and asian economies weakened and pricing deteriorated for a prolonged period  we have the financial and operational flexibility to reduce production  delay capital expenditures  sell assets and reduce overhead costs to provide liquidity in the absence of cash flow from operations 
we have implemented a global exploration program  which is integral to our growth strategy and is focused on identifying and capturing new projects for future development or projects that add significant value to existing operations 
our global exploration group is expected to provide us with opportunities for significant future potential reserve additions globally and we expect to spend approximately million in throughout  we have spent approximately million related to our involvement in exploration activities  which is comprised of both exploration expenditures and net investments 
in addition  our ferroalloys operations are in the feasibility stage of the development of our chromite project in northern ontario and we expect to spend approximately million in on engineering and feasibility studies  as well as on other

investing activities net cash used by investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared with  million for the comparable period in significant activity occurred in may as we completed our acquisition of consolidated thompson for a net acquisition price of  million 
in addition  we purchased the outstanding consolidated thompson senior secured notes directly from the note holders for million  including accrued and unpaid interest 
we also had capital expenditures of  million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
as we remain focused on organic growth and expansion  our main capital focus has been on the construction of the bloom lake phase ii operations 
on the ramp up and expansion projects at the bloom lake mine  we have spent approximately million and approximately million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
although dependent on market conditions which could impact timing of completion of phase ii  we expect total capital spend related to the ramp up and expansion projects at the bloom lake mine to be million during and in addition other major capital projects throughout and included expansion projects at our koolyanobbing  empire and tilden mines  the ramp up to bring our lower war eagle mine into production and repair and upgrades to our oak grove mine that incurred significant tornado damage during the second quarter of the completion of the expansion project at our koolyanobbing mine has increased production capacity to approximately million metric tons per year 
the expansion project required a capital investment of million  of which approximately million and million was spent in and through  respectively 
extending the existing production capacity at our empire mine and increasing production capacity at our tilden mine in michigan upper peninsula required an investment of million and million during the year ended december  and through december   respectively 
in order to bring lower war eagle mine  a high volatile metallurgical coal mine in west virginia into production during  we spent approximately million and million of capital for the year ended december  and through december   respectively 
as a result of the significant tornado damage to the above ground operations at our oak grove mine during the second quarter of  we completed a million capital project to repair the damage  of which million and million was spent in and  respectively 
we additionally spent approximately million and million globally on expenditures related to sustaining capital in and  respectively 
sustaining capital spend includes environmental  infrastructure  mobile equipment  safety  fixed equipment  quality and health 
in alignment with our strategy to focus on organic growth and expansion initiatives and  based upon our long term outlook  we anticipate total cash used for capital expenditures in to be approximately million 
this is comprised of sustaining capital expenditures for all of our operations and growth and productive capital expenditures related to bloom lake mine expansion to increase processing capabilities 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities during was million  compared to  million for the comparable period in cash flows provided by financing activities during included million in net proceeds from the issuance of the million senior notes  completed through a public offering in december a portion of the net proceeds from the senior notes offering was used on december  to repay the million and million outstanding private placement senior notes and also for the repayment of a portion of the borrowings outstanding under the term loan facility and the revolving credit facility

table of contents capital resources we expect to fund our business obligations from available cash  current and future operations and existing borrowing arrangements 
we also may pursue other funding strategies in the capital markets to strengthen our liquidity 
the following represents a summary of key liquidity measures as of december  and december  in millions december  december  cash and cash equivalents available revolving credit facility revolving loans drawn senior notes senior notes drawn term loan term loans drawn letter of credit obligations and other commitments borrowing capacity available the above liquidity as of december  reflects the availability of our revolving credit facility to the extent it would not result in a violation of our funded debt to ebitda maximum ratio of to as of february  and as a result of the execution of the amendments to the revolving credit facility and term loan in consideration of the temporary financial covenants in place  our availability under the billion revolving credit facility is no longer restricted  as discussed below 
refer to note debt and credit facilities of our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our debt and credit facilities 
our primary source of funding is a billion revolving credit facility  that on october   we amended to extend the maturity date from august  to october  no other significant changes were made to the terms of the revolving credit facility in the amendment 
this facility has available borrowing capacity of million as of december  due to current covenant restrictions 
effective august   we amended our multicurrency credit agreement by increasing the borrowing capacity to billion from million and providing more flexible financial covenants and debt restrictions through the amendment of certain customary covenants 
we also have cash generated by the business and cash on hand  which totaled million as of december  the combination of cash and the credit facility gave us million in liquidity entering the first quarter of  which is expected to be used to fund operations  capital expenditures and finance strategic initiatives 
we are subject to certain financial covenants contained in the amended revolving credit and term loan agreements 
as of december  and december   we were in compliance with each of our financial covenants 
the amended revolving credit agreement and term loan have two financial covenants based on debt to earnings ratio total funded debt to ebitda  as those terms are defined in the amended revolving credit agreement  as of the last day of each fiscal quarter cannot exceed i to and interest coverage ratio consolidated ebitda to interest expense  as those terms are defined in the amended revolving credit agreement  for the preceding four quarters must not be less than to on the last day of any fiscal quarter 
based on recent projections  and despite our compliance with our debt covenants under the credit agreement and term loan as of december   we have projected non compliance with the total funded debt to ebitda ratio described above 
this is driven primarily by lower than expected results in the second half of  as the ebitda used in determining our compliance is based on a trailing month ebitda 
table of contents amount 
as a result  on february   we amended both the revolving credit agreement and the term loan agreement to effect the following suspend the current funded debt to ebitda ratio requirement for all quarterly measurement periods in  after which point it will revert back to the debt to earnings ratio for the period ending march  until maturity 
require a minimum tangible net worth of approximately billion as of each of the three month periods ended march   june   september  and december  minimum tangible net worth  in accordance with the amended revolving credit agreement and term loan agreement  is defined as total shareholders equity less goodwill and intangible assets 
maintain a maximum total funded debt to capitalization of percent from the amendments effective date until the period ending december the amended agreements retain the minimum interest coverage ratio requirement of to  as defined above 
per the terms of the amended revolving credit and term loan agreements  we are subject to higher borrowing costs 
the applicable interest rate is determined by reference to the former funded debt to ebitda ratio  however  as discussed above  this is not a financial covenant of the amended agreements until march  based on the amended terms  borrowing costs could increase as much as percent relative to the outstanding borrowings  as well as percent on unborrowed amounts 
furthermore  the amended revolving credit agreement and term loan agreement place certain restrictions upon our declaration and payment of dividends  our ability to consummate acquisitions and the debt levels of our subsidiaries 
we believe that the amended revolving credit and term loan agreements provide us sufficient liquidity to support our operating and investing activities 
we continue to focus on achieving a capital structure that achieves the optimal mix of debt  equity and other off balance sheet financing arrangements 
several credit markets may provide additional capacity should that become necessary 
the bank market may provide funding through a term loan  bridge loan  revolving credit facility or through exercising the million accordion in our current revolving credit facility or the million accordion available through our term loan 
the risk associated with the bank market is significant increases in borrowing costs as a result of limited capacity 
as in all debt markets  capacity is a global issue that impacts the bond market 
our issuance of a million public offering of five year senior notes in december provides evidence that capacity in the bond markets has improved and remains stable for investment grade companies compared to conditions impacting such markets in previous years 
this transaction represents the successful execution of our strategy to increase liquidity and extend debt maturities to align with longer term capital structure needs 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any other significant off balance sheet arrangements except for those disclosed in the future cash commitments and contractual obligations table 
market risks we are subject to a variety of risks  including those caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
we have established policies and procedures to manage such risks  however  certain risks are beyond our control 

table of contents valuation of goodwill and other long lived assets we assign goodwill arising from acquired companies to the reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis as of october st and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology  which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an estimated weighted average cost of capital 
assessing the recoverability of our goodwill requires significant assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of a reporting unit including  among other things  estimates related to long term price expectations  expected results of anticipated exploration activities  foreign currency exchange rates  expected capital expenditures and working capital requirements  which are based upon our long range plan and life of mine estimates 
the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit may change from year to year based on operating results  current market conditions or changes to expectations of market trends and other factors 
changes in these assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
such indicators may include  among others a significant decline in expected future cash flows  a sustained  significant decline in market pricing  a significant adverse change in legal or environmental factors or in the business climate  changes in estimates of our recoverable reserves  unanticipated competition  and slower growth or production rates 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of our long lived assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations and statement of financial position 
a comparison of each asset group carrying value to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets  including cost of disposition  is used to determine if an asset is recoverable 
projected future cash flows reflect management best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period  including growth rates in revenues and costs  estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and capital expenditures 
if the carrying value of the asset group is higher than its undiscounted future cash flows  the asset group is measured at fair value and the difference is recorded as a reduction to the long lived assets 
we estimate fair value using a market approach  an income approach or a cost approach 
the assessments for goodwill and long lived asset impairment are sensitive to changes in key assumptions 
these key assumptions include  but are not limited to  forecasted long term pricing  production costs  capital expenditures and a variety of economic assumptions eg discount rate  inflation rates  exchange rates and tax rates 
for instance  for the year ended december   the average platts percent fe daily index was approximately per ton  and prices during that period ranged from approximately per ton to per ton 
continued volatility of these spot prices in isolation or combined with changes in other key assumptions  may impact adversely the cash flows of our reporting units 

table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk we are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as a result of our operations in australia and canada  which could impact our financial condition 
with respect to australia  foreign exchange risk arises from our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because our reporting currency is the us dollar  but the functional currency of our asia pacific operations is the australian dollar 
our asia pacific operations receive funds in us currency for their iron ore and coal sales and incur costs in australian currency 
for our canadian operations  the functional currency is the us dollar  however  the production costs for these operations primarily are incurred in the canadian dollar 
we began hedging our exposure to the canadian dollar in january the primary objective for the use of these instruments is to reduce exposure to changes in australian and us currency exchange rates and canadian and us currency exchange rates  respectively  and to protect against undue adverse movement in these exchange rates 
at december   we had outstanding australian and canadian foreign exchange rate contracts with notional amounts of million and million  respectively  with varying maturity dates ranging from january to december for which we elected hedge accounting 
to evaluate the effectiveness of our hedges  we conduct sensitivity analysis 
a percent increase in the value of the australian dollar from the month end rate would increase the fair value of these contracts to approximately million  and a percent decrease would reduce the fair value to approximately negative million 
a percent increase in the value of the canadian dollar from the month end rate would increase the fair value of these contracts to approximately million  and a percent decrease would decrease the fair value to approximately negative million 
we may enter into additional hedging instruments in the near future as needed in order to further hedge our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the following table represents our foreign currency exchange contract position for contracts held as cash flow hedges as of december  in millions contract maturity notional amount weighted average exchange rate spot rate fair value contract portfolio aud contracts expiring in the next months cad contracts expiring in the next months total hedge contract portfolio includes collar options and forward contracts 
refer to note derivative instruments and hedging activities for further information 
interest rate risk interest payable on our senior notes is at fixed rates 
interest payable under our revolving credit facility and term loan is at a floating rate based upon the base rate or the libor rate plus a margin depending on a leverage ratio 
as of december   we had million drawn on the revolving credit facility and million outstanding on the term loan 
a basis point change to the base rate or the libor rate under the term loan and revolving credit facility would result in a change of approximately million and million  respectively  to interest expense on an annual basis 
interest rate risk is managed using a portfolio of variable and fixed rate debt composed of short and long term instruments  such as us treasury lock agreements and interest rate swaps 
from time to time  these instruments  which are derivative instruments  are entered into to facilitate the maintenance of the desired ratio of variable and fixed rate debt 
these derivative instruments are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges 
these instruments did not have a material impact on our financial statements for the year ended december  
table of contents the interest rate payable on the million senior notes due in may be subject to adjustments from time to time if either moody or s p or  in either case  any substitute rating agency thereof downgrades or subsequently upgrades the debt rating assigned to the notes 
in no event shall the interest rate for the notes be reduced to below the interest rate payable on the notes on the date of the initial issuance of notes or the total increase in the interest rate on the notes exceed above the interest rate payable on the notes on the date of the initial issuance of notes 
the maximum rate increase of for the interest rate payable on the notes would result in an additional interest expense of million per annum 
pricing risks provisional pricing arrangements certain of our us iron ore  eastern canadian iron ore and asia pacific iron ore customer supply agreements specify provisional price calculations  where the pricing mechanisms generally are based on market pricing  with the final sales price to be based on market inputs at a specified point in time in the future  per the terms of the supply agreements 
the difference between the provisionally agreed upon price and the estimated final sales price is characterized as a derivative and is required to be accounted for separately once the revenue has been recognized 
the derivative instrument is adjusted to fair value through product revenues each reporting period based upon current market data and forward looking estimates provided by management until the final sales price is determined 
at december   we have recorded million as current derivative assets and million as derivative liabilities included in other current liabilities in the statements of consolidated financial position related to our estimate of final sales rate with our us iron ore  eastern canadian iron ore and asia pacific iron ore customers 
these amounts represent the difference between the provisional price agreed upon with our customers based on the supply agreement terms and our estimate of the final sales rate based on the price calculations established in the supply agreements 
as a result  we recognized a net million decrease in product revenues in the statements of consolidated operations for the year ended december  related to these arrangements 
customer supply agreements certain supply agreements with one us iron ore customer provide for supplemental revenue or refunds based on the customer s average annual steel pricing at the time the product is consumed in the customer s blast furnace 
the supplemental pricing is characterized as a freestanding derivative  which is finalized based on a future price  and is adjusted to fair value as a revenue adjustment each reporting period until the pellets are consumed and the amounts are settled 
the fair value of the instrument is determined using an income approach based on an estimate of the annual realized price of hot rolled steel at the steelmaker s facilities 
at december   we had a derivative asset of million  representing the fair value of the pricing factors  based upon the amount of unconsumed tons and an estimated average hot band steel price related to the period in which the tons are expected to be consumed in the customer s blast furnace at each respective steelmaking facility  subject to final pricing at a future date 
this compares with a derivative asset of million as of december  we estimate that a change in the average hot band steel price realized from the december  estimated price recorded would cause the fair value of the derivative instrument to increase or decrease by approximately million  thereby impacting our consolidated revenues by the same amount 
we have not entered into any hedging programs to mitigate the risk of adverse price fluctuations  nor do we intend to hedge our exposure to such risks in the future  however  certain of our term supply agreements contain price collars  which typically limit the percentage increase or decrease in prices for our products during any given year 

table of contents volatile energy and fuel costs the volatile cost of energy is an important issue affecting our production costs  primarily in relation to our iron ore operations 
our consolidated us iron ore mining ventures consumed approximately million mmbtu s of natural gas at an average delivered price of per mmbtu and million gallons of diesel fuel at an average delivered price of per gallon during our consolidated eastern canadian iron ore mining ventures consumed approximately million gallons of diesel fuel at an average delivered price of per gallon during our clcc operations consumed approximately million gallons of diesel fuel at an average delivered price of per gallon during consumption of diesel fuel by our asia pacific operations was approximately million gallons at an average delivered price of per gallon for the same period 
in the ordinary course of business  there also will be likely increases in prices relative to electrical costs at our us mine sites 
as the cost of producing electricity increases  energy companies regularly seek to reclaim those costs from the mine sites  which often results in tariff disputes 
our strategy to address increasing energy rates includes improving efficiency in energy usage and utilizing the lowest cost alternative fuels 
at the present time we have no specific plans to enter into hedging activity and do not plan to enter into any new forward contracts for natural gas or diesel fuel in the near term 
we will continue to monitor relevant energy markets for risk mitigation opportunities and may make additional forward purchases or employ other hedging instruments in the future as warranted and deemed appropriate by management 
assuming we do not enter into further hedging activity in the near term  a percent change in natural gas and diesel fuel prices would result in a change of approximately million in our annual fuel and energy cost based on expected consumption for supply concentration risks many of our mines are dependent on one source each of electric power and natural gas 
a significant interruption or change in service or rates from our energy suppliers could impact materially our production costs  margins and profitability 
outlook in  we anticipate the end markets for our products to remain healthy  primarily driven by china continued demand for steelmaking raw materials 
we expect our global iron ore sales to be relatively flat year over year at approximately million tons 
while the recent iron ore spot price reached per ton  a new month high  we expect pricing for the commodities we sell to remain volatile 
due to this expected volatility and for the purpose of providing a full year outlook  we will utilize the year to date average percent fe seaborne iron ore spot price as of january   which was per ton cfr china  as a base price assumption for providing our full year revenue per ton sensitivities for our iron ore business segments

table of contents recently issued accounting pronouncements refer to note business summary and significant accounting policies of the consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the respective dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition 
critical accounting estimates management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
preparation of financial statements requires management to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses  and the related disclosures of contingencies 
management bases its estimates on various assumptions and historical experience  which are believed to be reasonable  however  due to the inherent nature of estimates  actual results may differ significantly due to changed conditions or assumptions 
on a regular basis  management reviews the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are fairly presented in accordance with gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
management believes that the following critical accounting estimates and judgments have a significant impact on our financial statements 
revenue recognition us  eastern canadian and asia pacific iron ore provisional pricing arrangements most of our us iron ore long term supply agreements are comprised of a base price with annual price adjustment factors  some of which are subject to annual price collars in order to limit the percentage increase or decrease in prices for our iron ore pellets during any given year 
the base price is the primary component of the purchase price for each contract 
the inflation indexed price adjustment factors are integral to the iron ore supply contracts and vary based on the agreement  but typically include adjustments based upon changes in benchmark and international pellet prices and changes in specified producers price indices  including those for all commodities  industrial commodities  energy and steel 
the pricing adjustments generally operate in the same manner  with each factor typically comprising a portion of the price adjustment  although the weighting of each factor varies based upon the specific terms of each agreement 
in most cases  these adjustment factors have not been finalized at the time our product is sold 
in these cases  we historically have estimated the adjustment factors at each reporting period based upon the best third party information available 
the estimates are then adjusted to actual when the information has been finalized 
the producer price indices remain an estimated component of the sales price throughout the contract year and are estimated each quarter using publicly available forecasts of such indices 
the final indices referenced in certain of the us iron ore supply contracts are typically not published by the us department of labor until the second quarter of the subsequent year 
as a result  we record an adjustment for the difference between the fourth quarter estimate and the final price in the following year 
throughout the year  certain of our eastern canadian and asia pacific iron ore customers have contract arrangements in which pricing settlements are based upon an average benchmark pricing for future periods 
most of the future periods are settled within three months 
to the extent the particular pricing settlement period is subsequent to the reporting period  we estimate the final pricing settlement based upon information available 
similar to us iron ore  the estimates are then adjusted to actual when the price settlement period elapses 
historically  provisional pricing arrangement adjustments have not been material as they have represented less than half of one percent of us  eastern canadian and asia pacific iron ore respective revenues for each of the three preceding fiscal years ended december   and 
table of contents us iron ore customer supply agreements in addition  certain supply agreements with one us iron ore customer include provisions for supplemental revenue or refunds based on the customer average annual steel pricing for the year the product is consumed in the customer blast furnaces 
the supplemental pricing is characterized as a freestanding derivative and is required to be accounted for separately once the product is shipped 
the derivative instrument  which is finalized based on a future price  is marked to fair value as a revenue adjustment each reporting period until the pellets are consumed and the amounts are settled 
the fair value of the instrument is determined using a market approach based on an estimate of the annual realized price of hot rolled steel at the steelmaker facilities  and takes into consideration current market conditions and nonperformance risk 
at december   we had a derivative asset of million  representing the fair value of the pricing factors  based upon the amount of unconsumed tons and an estimated average hot band steel price related to the period in which the tons are expected to be consumed in the customer blast furnace at each respective steelmaking facility  subject to final pricing at a future date 
this compares with a derivative asset of million as of december   based upon the amount of unconsumed tons and the related estimated average hot band steel price 
the customer average annual price is not known at the time of sale and the actual price is received on a delayed basis at the end of the year  once the average annual price has been finalized 
as a result  we estimate the average price and adjust the estimate to actual in the fourth quarter when the information is provided by the customer at the end of each year 
information used in developing the estimate includes such factors as production and pricing information from the customer  current spot prices  third party analyst forecasts  publications and other industry information 
the accuracy of our estimates typically increases as the year progresses based on additional information in the market becoming available and the customer ability to more accurately determine the average price it will realize for the year 
the following represents the historical accuracy of our pricing estimates related to the derivative as well as the impact on revenue resulting from the difference between the estimated price and the actual price for each quarter during  and prior to receiving final information from the customer for tons consumed during each year final price estimated price impact on revenue in millions final price estimated price impact on revenue in millions final price estimated price impact on revenue in millions first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter we estimate that a change in the average hot band steel price realized from the december  estimated price recorded for the unconsumed tons remaining at year end would cause the fair value of the derivative instrument to increase or decrease by approximately million  thereby impacting our consolidated revenues by the same amount 
mineral reserves we regularly evaluate our economic mineral reserves and update them as required in accordance with sec industry guide the estimated mineral reserves could be affected by future industry conditions  geological conditions and ongoing mine planning 
maintenance of effective production capacity or the mineral reserve could require increases in capital and development expenditures 
generally  as mining operations progress  haul lengths and lifts increase 
alternatively  changes in economic conditions or the expected quality of mineral reserves could decrease capacity or mineral reserves 
technological progress could alleviate such factors or increase capacity of mineral reserves 
we use our mineral reserve estimates  combined with our estimated annual production levels  to determine the mine closure dates utilized in recording the fair value liability for asset retirement obligations 
refer to note environmental and mine closure obligations  for further information 
since 
table of contents the liability represents the present value of the expected future obligation  a significant change in mineral reserves or mine lives would have a substantial effect on the recorded obligation 
we also utilize economic mineral reserves for evaluating potential impairments of mine assets and in determining maximum useful lives utilized to calculate depreciation and amortization of long lived mine assets 
increases or decreases in mineral reserves or mine lives could significantly affect these items 
asset retirement obligations and environmental remediation costs the accrued mine closure obligations for our active mining operations provide for contractual and legal obligations associated with the eventual closure of the mining operations 
our obligations are determined based on detailed estimates adjusted for factors that a market participant would consider ie  inflation  overhead and profit  which are escalated at an assumed rate of inflation to the estimated closure dates  and then discounted using the current credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
the estimate also incorporates incremental increases in the closure cost estimates and changes in estimates of mine lives 
the closure date for each location is determined based on the exhaustion date of the remaining iron ore reserves  which is dependent on our estimate of the economically recoverable mineral reserves 
the estimated obligations are particularly sensitive to the impact of changes in mine lives given the difference between the inflation and discount rates 
changes in the base estimates of legal and contractual closure costs due to changes in legal or contractual requirements  available technology  inflation  overhead or profit rates also would have a significant impact on the recorded obligations 
we have a formal policy for environmental protection and restoration 
our obligations for known environmental matters at active and closed mining operations and other sites have been recognized based on estimates of the cost of investigation and remediation at each site 
if the obligation can only be estimated as a range of possible amounts  with no specific amount being more likely  the minimum of the range is accrued 
management reviews its environmental remediation sites quarterly to determine if additional cost adjustments or disclosures are required 
the characteristics of environmental remediation obligations  where information concerning the nature and extent of clean up activities is not immediately available and which are subject to changes in regulatory requirements  result in a significant risk of increase to the obligations as they mature 
expected future expenditures are not discounted to present value unless the amount and timing of the cash disbursements can be reasonably estimated 
potential insurance recoveries are not recognized until realized 
refer to note environmental and mine closure obligations  for further information 
income taxes our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in projecting future taxable income  we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and changes in accounting policies and incorporate assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and foreign pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide  we consider three years of cumulative operating income loss 
at december  and  we had a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively  against our deferred tax assets 
our losses in certain locations in recent periods represented 
table of contents sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets 
additionally  significant alternative minimum tax credits have been generated in recent years 
sufficient negative evidence suggests that the credits will not be realized in the foreseeable future  and a full valuation allowance has been recorded on the deferred tax asset 
we intend to maintain a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the realization of such assets 
changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on the company results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements requires that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on technical merits 
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with asc  and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 
valuation of goodwill goodwill represents the excess purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of acquired companies 
we assign goodwill arising from acquired companies to the reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition 
our reporting units are either at the operating segment level or a component one level below our operating segments that constitutes a business for which management generally reviews production and financial results of that component 
decisions are often made as to capital expenditures  investments and production plans at the component level as part of the ongoing management of the related operating segment 
we have determined that our asia pacific iron ore and ferroalloys operating segments constitute separate reporting units  that cqim and our wabush mine within our eastern canadian iron ore operating segment constitute reporting units  that clcc within our north american coal operating segment constitutes a reporting unit and that our northshore mine within our us iron ore operating segment constitutes a reporting unit 
goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of each year or as circumstances occur that potentially indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
we use a two step process to test goodwill for impairment 
in the first step  we generally use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit  which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an estimated weighted average cost of capital 
in assessing the valuation of our goodwill  significant assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of a reporting unit must be made  including among other things  estimates related to long term price expectations  foreign currency exchange rates  expected capital expenditures and working capital requirements  which are based upon our long range plan and life of mine estimates 
if the discounted cash flow analysis yields a fair value estimate less than the reporting unit carrying value  we would proceed to step two of the impairment test 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit fair value to the assets and liabilities other than goodwill in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
in performing this allocation of fair value to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  we typically utilize third party valuation firms to support the fair values allocated 
the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and  if the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
if these estimates were to change in the future as a 
table of contents result of changes in strategy or market conditions  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in the period such determination was made 
after performing our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of  we determined that million and million  respectively  of goodwill associated with our cqim and wabush reporting units  which are both included in the eastern canadian iron ore segment  was impaired as the carrying value of these reporting units exceeded their fair value 
additionally  during our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of  we determined that million of goodwill associated with our clcc reporting unit included in the north american coal segment was impaired as the carrying value with this reporting unit exceeded its fair value 
as of december   the remaining value of goodwill associated with our asia pacific iron ore  ferroalloys and us iron ore reporting units totaled million  million and million  respectively 
no goodwill remains within our eastern canadian iron ore or north american coal reporting units as of december  no impairment charges were identified in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test with respect to any of our other identified reporting units 
the fair values for our ferroalloys  asia pacific iron ore and northshore reporting units were substantially in excess of our carrying values

valuation of long lived assets in assessing the recoverability of our long lived assets  significant assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets must be made  as well as the related estimated useful lives 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy or market conditions  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in the period such determination was made 
we monitor conditions that indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may be impaired 
in order to determine if assets have been impaired  assets are grouped and tested at the lowest level for which identifiable  independent cash flows are available 
an impairment loss exists when projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets 
the measurement of the impairment loss to be recognized is based on the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the assets 
fair value can be determined using a market approach  income approach or cost approach 
the impairment analysis and fair value determination can result in substantially different outcomes based on critical assumptions and estimates including the quantity and quality of remaining economic ore reserves  future iron ore prices and production costs 
due to lower than previously expected profits as a result of decreased iron ore pricing expectations and higher than anticipated production costs  we determined that indicators of impairment with respect to certain of our long lived assets groups existed at december  our asset groups generally consist of the assets and liabilities of one or more mines  preparation plants and associated reserves for which the lowest level of identifiable cash flows are largely independent of cash flows of other mines  preparation plants and associated reserves 
as a result of this assessment  we determined that the cash flows associated with our eastern canadian pelletizing operations were not sufficient to support the recoverability of the carrying value of these productive assets 
accordingly  an asset impairment charge of million was recorded related to the wabush mine property  plant and equipment that were reported in our eastern canadian iron ore operating segment during the fourth quarter of no impairment charges were identified in connection with our other long lived asset groups as of december  refer to note business summary and significant accounting policies  for further information regarding our policy on asset impairment 

table of contents employee retirement benefit obligations we offer defined benefit pension plans  defined contribution pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans  primarily consisting of retiree healthcare benefits  to most employees in north america as part of a total compensation and benefits program 
this includes employees of clcc who became employees of the company through the july acquisition 
upon the acquisition of the remaining percent interest in wabush in february  we fully consolidated the canadian plans into our pension and opeb obligations 
we do not have employee retirement benefit obligations at our asia pacific iron ore operations 
the defined benefit pension plans largely are noncontributory and benefits generally are based on employees years of service and average earnings for a defined period prior to retirement or a minimum formula 
following is a summary of our defined benefit pension and opeb funding and expense for the years through pension opeb funding expense funding expense estimated assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and the value of plan assets for defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans primarily retiree healthcare benefits that we offer are evaluated periodically by management 
critical assumptions  such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the medical care cost trend  and the rate of compensation increase are reviewed annually 
as of december  and  we used the following assumptions pension and other benefits us plan discount rate canadian pension plan discount rate canadian opeb plan discount rate rate of compensation increase us expected return on plan assets canadian expected return on plan assets the decrease in the discount rates in was driven by the change in bond yields  which were down approximately basis points compared to the prior year 
additionally  on december   we adopted the irs prescribed mortality tables separate pre retirement and postretirement to determine the expected life of our plan participants  replacing the irs prescribed mortality tables for our us plans 
the assumed mortality remained the same as the previous year for our canadian plans  up with full projection
