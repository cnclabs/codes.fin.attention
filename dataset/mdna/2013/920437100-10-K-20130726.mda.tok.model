restructuring of asset management and mutual fund distribution businesses the company completed the restructuring of its asset management and mutual fund distribution businesses the restructuring transaction on december  the restructuring date and executed the eam declaration of trust the eam declaration of trust

business environment during the twelve months ended april   the nasdaq and the dow jones industrial average were up and  respectively 
the risk averse temperament of investors continues to restrain both the company s revenues from its research periodicals and publications and the company s cash flows from its non voting revenues and non voting profits interests in eam 
the us economy has been weaving an irregular recovery path over the past year  accelerating for a time  then just as quickly losing momentum 
during the third quarter of calendar  the nation s gross domestic product jumped forward by 
a drawdown in inventories and a marked retreat in defense related spending then combined to hold growth to a scant for the calendar year 
as we moved into  expectations were that the economy would rebound smartly early in the year  which it did  as gdp climbed by 
now  some sluggishness in several industrial and consumer categories  coupled with the ill effects of the government s mandated spending reductions  or sequestrations  seem likely to pare the current quarter s growth to just 
encouragingly  we think these dislocations will largely  though not completely  run their course over the next few months  so that during the second half of calendar  growth could well nudge back above 
unfortunately  notwithstanding the noteworthy recovery in the housing market  indications that employment will continue to track higher  and the seeming commitment of the federal reserve to furthering the business expansion via exceptionally accommodative monetary policies  there is every likelihood that this three steps forward  two steps back growth progression will remain in place for the balance of this year 
on the whole  however  we sense that growth will accelerate modestly and perhaps more consistently in  and that this upturn  underpinned by benign inflation and historically low interest rates  will remain in force for several years thereafter 
all told  this should be a solid investment backdrop in which to gradually accumulate equities 
results of operations for fiscal years  and the following table illustrates the company s key components of revenues and expenses

within investment periodicals and related publications  subscription sales orders are derived from print and digital products 
the following chart illustrates the changes in the sales orders associated with print and digital subscriptions

the company continued its efforts to attract new subscribers through various marketing channels  primarily direct mail and the internet for retail users  and by the efforts of our sales personnel in the institutional market 
total product line circulation at april  was above total product line circulation at april   reversing a long term trend 
continuing factors that have contributed to the decline in the investment periodicals and related publications revenues include competition in the form of free or low cost investment research on the internet and research provided by brokerage firms at no direct cost to their clients 
the company has been successful in growing revenues from digitally delivered investment periodicals within institutional sales 
institutional sales orders of  for the twelve months ended april   were  or above comparable sales orders of  for the twelve months ended april  this growth continues a positive trend for institutional sales  but is not sufficient to wholly offset the lost revenues from retail subscribers 
we have also benefited from converting some customers from retail to professional price services 
print publication revenues decreased  or  for the twelve months ended april  from fiscal for the reasons described earlier 
earned revenues from institutional print publications increased  or  for the twelve months ended april  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
print publications revenues from retail subscribers decreased  or  for the twelve months ended april   as compared to the prior fiscal year 
print products circulation declined as of april  as compared to print circulation at april  digital publications revenues increased  or  for the twelve months ended april  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
earned revenues from institutional digital publications increased  or  for the twelve months ended april   as compared to the prior fiscal year 
digital publications revenues from retail subscribers decreased  or  for the twelve months ended april   as compared to the prior fiscal year 
digital products circulation increased as of april  as compared to digital circulation at april  investment periodicals and related publications revenues were down  or  for the twelve months ended april   as compared to fiscal total product line circulation at april  was lower than total product line circulation at april  gross institutional sales orders of  for the twelve months ended april   were  or above comparable sales orders of  for the twelve months ended april  print publication revenues decreased  or  for the twelve months ended april  from fiscal for the twelve months ended april   earned revenues from institutional print publications increased  or as compared to fiscal for the twelve months ended april   print publications revenues from retail subscribers decreased  or  as compared to fiscal print circulation decreased as of april  as compared to print circulation at april  digital publications revenues decreased  or  for the twelve months ended april  from fiscal for the twelve months ended april   earned revenues from institutional digital publications increased  or as compared to fiscal for the twelve months ended april   digital publications revenues from retail subscribers decreased  or  as compared to fiscal the company has relied more on its institutional sales marketing efforts  and the increase in institutional combined print and digital revenues is a direct result of a focused effort to sell to colleges  libraries and corporate investment adviser accounts 
the decrease in digital and print retail publications revenues is primarily attributable to the decrease in circulation within the company s products 
the majority of the company s subscribers have traditionally been individual investors who generally receive printed publications via us mail on a weekly basis 
consistent with the experience of other print publishers in many fields  the company has found that its roster of customers has been declining as individuals migrate to various digital services 
a modest number of customers who do not qualify for retail prices have chosen to cancel their subscriptions  while the rest have converted to institutional services  at higher prices 
individual investors interested in digitally delivered investment information have access to free equity research from many sources 
for example  most retail broker dealers with computerized trading services offer their customers free or low cost research services that compete with the company s services 
revenues from the company s current retail online services have also declined because many competing products offer more extensive interactive features 
notably in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company has increased its efforts on renewing non institutional subscriptions by increasing the number of renewal notifications including increases in e mail and telemarketing efforts 
the company believes that the volatility of the equity market and the sluggish economic recovery have to some extent eroded retail investor interest in equities 
the company also believes that the negative trend in overall subscription revenue could continue until new products have been developed and marketed and the company has implemented and adapted customer contact methods better suited to their changing needs 
the company has established the goal of developing competitive digital products and marketing them effectively through traditional as well as internet and mobile channels 
towards that end  the company has been modernizing legacy information technology systems 
the company is not able to predict when these efforts will result in the launch of new products or whether they will be successful in reversing the trend of declining retail publishing revenues 
during the latter part of fiscal  there were a number of technology advances effected in advance of the planned launch of our new product offerings expected to begin in fiscal in december  the new fulfillment system was placed in service that gives the company the ability to perform real time order processing and grant immediate access to our digital products  as well as offering multi tiered entitlements which will come into play in fiscal with the company s new product offerings 
in december  a new e commerce platform and a single sign on module were launched which directly leverage the new fulfillment system s capabilities for new web order entry and customers access to their products via a single username and password 
both of these services are a substantial progression from the previous solutions 
in addition  the company launched a new institutional sales website valuelinepro 
com during march valuelinepro 
com provides a dedicated internet destination for investment advisers  portfolio managers  corporate professionals and library patrons who seek to learn how value line s proprietary research tools can help them research stocks  mutual funds  options  convertible securities and exchange traded funds etfs 
the site thoroughly describes each of the company s customized products available to institutions and investment professionals 
targeted digital advertising programs have been a part of the company s marketing efforts to institutions  generating additional sales leads for our team of experienced sales executives and support personnel 
copyright data fees the value line proprietary ranking system information the ranking system  a component of the company s flagship product  the value line investment survey  is also utilized in the company s copyright data business 
the ranking system is also required to be made available to eam for specific uses without charge or expense 
the ranking system is designed to be predictive over a six to twelve month period 
for the six and twelve months ended april   the combined ranking system timeliness rank stocks increased by and  respectively  allowing for weekly changes in ranks  outperforming an increase of and in the s p index during the comparable periods  respectively 
during the twelve months ended april   copyright data fees increased  or  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
as of april   total third party sponsored assets were attributable to four contracts for copyright data representing billion in various products  as compared to four contracts and billion in assets at april  the decrease in assets managed by third party sponsors resulted from a shift in assets in one of the underlying portfolios to a new subadvisor which was beyond value line s control 
the company believes the growth of this part of the business is dependent upon the desire of third parties to use the value line trademarks and proprietary research for their products 
this market has become significantly more competitive as a result of product diversification and increased use of indices by portfolio managers 
management is focusing on potential channels for the copyright data products  while maintaining good cooperation with current third party sponsors 
however  the company cannot predict if these efforts will be successful in reversing the trend of declining future revenues and assets managed by third party sponsors 
during the twelve months ended april   copyright data fees of  were above copyright data fees for fiscal as of april   total third party sponsored assets were attributable to four contracts for copyright data representing billion in various products  as compared to four contracts and billion in assets at april   representing a decrease in assets 
investment management fees and services unconsolidated as of the restructuring date  the company deconsolidated its asset management and mutual fund distribution businesses and its interest in these businesses was restructured as a non voting revenues and non voting profits interests in eam 
accordingly  the company no longer reports this operation as a separate business segment  although it still maintains a significant interest in the cash flows generated by this business and will receive ongoing payments in respect of its non voting revenues and non voting profits interests 
total assets in the value line funds managed and or distributed by eam at april   were billion  which is million or above total assets of billion in the value line funds managed by eam at april  total assets in the value line funds managed by eam at april   of billion were below total assets of billion in the value line funds managed by eam at april  although sales and inflows for the value line equity funds are up during fiscal and during fiscal  the value line funds continue to experience net redemptions for the last three fiscal years albeit at a much slower rate

however  while the value line funds are experiencing net redemptions  there are less net redemptions in the twelve months ended april  than in the prior year due to higher gross sales in the equity hybrid funds and better retention of existing fund assets 
the value line asset allocation fund is experiencing net inflows and was added to the schwab mutual fund onesource select list in august the fund is one of only seven asset allocation funds among the third party funds selected for the additional fund categories section

during fiscal  the administrator of the fair fund estimated that the remaining costs of administration would be less than originally determined due to a modification in the manner of administration and distribution of the fair fund

in fiscal  copyright data s revenues increased from fiscal and in fiscal they were slightly above fiscal costs for the company s copyright data products are relatively fixed costs for the company  so that expenses do not increase or decrease proportionately to changes in revenue 
the decline in the operating profit margin in the publishing segment in fiscal  as compared to fiscal was due to decreased revenues in addition to the reallocation of costs previously shared with the investment management segment to the publishing segment 
the company believes that competition in the form of free or low cost investment research on the internet and research provided by brokerage firms at no cost to their clients contributed to the decline in revenue in the publishing segment 
in fiscal  the recession and continued volatility in the markets also contributed to the decline in subscriptions to the company s products  as individuals reduced many forms of discretionary spending 
also  some investors may have shifted from equity investments to fixed income investments 
the company provides only limited research on fixed income investments  and this is not a core aspect of value line s business 
investment management negative operating margins for the investment management business conducted by the company during the period from may  through december  resulted primarily from the incurrence of expenses related to the restructuring transaction and declines in certain asset based revenues with no offsetting expense reductions 
lower management fees from the value line funds for this period resulted from lower average assets under management through december  and fee waivers 
the company waived management fees of  for the period from may  through december  in the usgmmf and  due to the low interest rate environment and new regulations restricting investments  that fund generated insufficient portfolio income to cover its normalized expenses  which were subsidized by the company

the fluctuation in the effective income tax rate during fiscal is attributable to a higher percentage of income subject to state and local taxes offset by the recognition of the domestic production tax credits and an increase in the dividends received deduction during the current fiscal year 
the change in the effective income tax rate in fiscal is attributable to the alternative minimum tax on the limitation to the company s net operating loss carryforward in fiscal years and  and a slight decrease in state and local tax rate for fiscal primarily from eam s geographical income allocation

seasonality our operations are minimally seasonal in nature

critical accounting estimates and policies the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accepted accounting principles as in effect in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent  and the company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition income taxes revenue recognition the majority of the company s revenues come from the sale of print and digital subscriptions and fees for copyright proprietary information  and  prior to december   investment management and b fees 
the company recognizes subscription revenue  net of discounts  in equal amounts over the term of the subscription  which generally ranges from three months to one year or longer  varying based on the product or service 
copyright data fees are calculated monthly based on market fluctuation and billed quarterly 
prior to the restructuring date  december   investment management fee and b fee revenues for the value line funds were recognized each month based upon the daily net asset value of each fund 
the company believes that the estimates related to revenue recognition are critical accounting estimates  and to the extent that there are material differences between its determination of revenues and actual results  its financial condition or results of operations may be affected 
income taxes the company s effective annual income tax expense rate is based on the us federal and state and local jurisdiction tax rates on income and losses that are part of its consolidated financial statements 
tax planning opportunities  non taxable income  expenses that are not deductible in the company s tax returns  and the blend of business income  including income derived from the company s non voting revenue and non voting profits interests in eam and income from securities transactions  will impact the effective tax rate in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates 
significant judgment is required in evaluating the company s tax positions 
tax law requires items to be included in the tax return at different times from when these items are reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
as a result  the effective tax rate reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements is different from the tax rate reported on the company s tax returns the company s cash tax rate 
these differences reverse over time  such as depreciation and amortization expenses 
these timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
as of april  and  the company had  and  respectively  of deferred tax assets 
in fiscal  deferred tax assets included  of short term deferred federal  state  and local taxes  related to the net operating loss carryforwards of  in assessing the company s deferred tax assets  the company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible or utilized in the company s tax filings 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  the company considers both positive and negative evidence  including tax planning strategies  projected future taxable income  and recent financial performance 
if after future assessments of the realizability of the deferred tax assets the company determines a lesser allowance is required  the company would record a reduction to the income tax expense and to the valuation allowance in the period this determination was made 
this would cause the company s income tax expense  effective tax rate  and net income to fluctuate 
in addition  the company establishes reserves at the time that it determines that it is more likely than not that it will need to pay additional taxes related to certain matters 
the company adjusts these reserves  including any impact of the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which the company has established a reserve is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
such liabilities are recorded as income taxes payable in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 
favorable resolutions of tax matters for which the company has previously established reserves are recognized as a reduction to the company s income tax expense when the amounts involved become known 
assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns requires judgment 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures the company s consolidated balance sheet includes a substantial amount of assets whose fair values are subject to market risks 
the company s market risks are primarily associated with interest rates and equity price risk 
the following sections address the significant market risks associated with the company s investment activities 
interest rate risk the company s strategy has historically been to acquire debt securities with low credit risk and low price risk 
despite this objective  management recognizes and accepts the possibility that losses may occur 
to limit the price fluctuation in these securities from interest rate changes  the company s management historically invested primarily in short term obligations maturing in less than one year 
at april  and april   the company did not have investments in securities with fixed maturities and therefore does not have any interest rate risk 
equity price risk the carrying values of investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet dates 
market prices are subject to fluctuation and  consequently  the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value 
fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the issuer  the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions 
furthermore  amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold 
the company s equity investment strategy has been to acquire equity securities across a diverse industry group 
the portfolio consists primarily of etfs and select common stock holdings of blue chip companies with a concentration on large capitalization companies with high relative dividend yields 
in order to maintain liquidity in these securities  the company s policy has been to invest in and hold in its portfolio  no more than of the approximate average daily trading volume in any one issue 
additionally  the company may purchase and hold non leveraged etfs whose performance inversely corresponds to the market value changes of investments in other etf securities held in the equity portfolio for dividend yield
