critical accounting policies and estimates in reviewing and understanding our financial information  it is important to read and understand the significant accounting policies used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
these policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and are essential in understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our accounting and financial reporting policies conform to us gaap and to general practices within the banking industry 
accordingly  the consolidated financial statements require 
table of contents certain estimates  judgments  and assumptions  which are believed to be reasonable  based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the years presented 
actual results could vary from those estimates  perhaps in material adverse ways  and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions 
the following accounting policies comprise those that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses and related provision expense are susceptible to change if the credit quality of our loan portfolio changes  which is evidenced by charge offs and non performing loan trends 
generally  one to four family residential real estate lending has a lower credit risk profile compared to consumer lending such as automobile or personal lines of credit loans 
while management intends to focus our efforts in diversifying the loan portfolio  in the past few years  our loan mix has changed as we focused our efforts on originating multi family residential loans  which in turn increased our income property multi family residential and commercial real estate loan portfolio over historical levels 
income property lending  however  has a higher credit risk profile than consumer and one to four family residential real estate loans due to these loans being larger in amount and non homogenous in structure and term 
changes in economic conditions  the mix and size of the loan portfolio and individual borrower conditions can dramatically impact our level of allowance for loan losses in relatively short periods of time 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that represents probably incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions 
in addition  our banking regulators and external auditor periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
these entities may require us to recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their review 
management evaluates current information and events regarding a borrower s ability to repay its obligations and considers a loan to be impaired when the ultimate collectability of amounts due  according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  is in doubt 
if an impaired loan is collateral dependent  the fair value of the collateral  less estimated costs to sell  is used to determine the amount of impairment  if any 
the amount of the impairment can be adjusted  based on current data  until such time as the actual basis is established by acquisition of the collateral 
impairment losses are reflected in the allowance for loan losses through a charge to the provision for loan losses 
subsequent recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses 
fair value of financial instruments 
the estimation of fair value is significant to certain of our assets  including investment securities available for sale  real estate owned  mortgage servicing assets  loans held for sale  derivatives  and the value of loan collateral for impaired loans 
these are all recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value 
fair values are determined based on third party sources  when available 
furthermore  gaap requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments as a part of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions  as more fully disclosed in note of our consolidated financial statements 
fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates  credit risk  prepayments  and other factors  especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items 
changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect the estimates

liquidity  capital resources and commitments liquidity may increase or decrease depending upon the availability of funds and comparative yields on investments in relation to the return on loans 
historically  we have maintained liquid assets at levels above the minimum requirements imposed by previous ots and now occ regulations and above levels believed to be adequate to meet the requirements of normal operations  including potential deposit outflows 
cash flow projections are regularly reviewed and updated to assure that adequate liquidity is maintained 
our liquidity  represented by cash and cash equivalents  interest earning accounts and mortgage backed and related securities  is a product of our operating  investing and financing activities

while scheduled payments from the amortization of loans  mortgage 
table of contents backed related securities and maturing investment securities and short term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
in addition  we invest excess funds in short term interest earning assets  which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements 
we also generate cash through borrowings 
we utilize federal home loan bank advances and previously used state of california time deposits  to leverage our capital base and provide funds for our lending and investment activities  and enhance our interest rate risk management 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
excess liquidity is generally invested in short term investments such as overnight deposits 
on a longer term basis  we maintain a strategy of investing in various lending products as described in greater detail under item business lending activities

these principles require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
our primary assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates  however  do not necessarily move in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the price of 
table of contents goods and services  since such prices are affected by inflation 
in a period of rapidly rising interest rates  the liquidity and maturity structure of our assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels 
the principal effect of inflation  as distinct from levels of interest rates  on earnings is in the area of non interest expense 
such expense items as employee compensation  employee benefits and occupancy and equipment costs may be subject to increases as a result of inflation

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset and liability management and market risk our risk when interest rates change 
the rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
market interest rates change over time 
our fixed rate loans generally have longer maturities than our fixed rate deposits 
accordingly  our results of operations  like those of other financial institutions  are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities 
the risk associated with changes in interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is our most significant market risk 
how we measure our risk of interest rate changes 
as part of our attempt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and comply with applicable regulations  we monitor our interest rate risk 
in monitoring interest rate risk  we continually analyze and manage assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates  the timing of their maturities  and their sensitivity to actual or potential changes in market interest rates 
in order to minimize the potential for adverse effects of material and prolonged increases in interest rates on our results of operations  we have adopted investment asset and liability management policies to better match the maturities and repricing terms of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the board of directors recommend and set the asset and liability policies of simplicity bank  which are implemented by the asset liability management committee 
the purpose of the asset liability management committee is to communicate  coordinate and direct asset liability management consistent with our business plan and board approved policies 
the committee establishes and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources taking into account relative costs and spreads  interest rate sensitivity and liquidity needs 
the objectives are to manage assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk and profitability goals 
the asset liability management committee generally meets at least monthly to review  among other things  economic conditions and interest rate outlook  current and projected liquidity needs and capital position  anticipated changes in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities and interest rate risk exposure limits versus current projections pursuant to net present value of portfolio equity analysis and income simulations 
the asset liability management committee recommends appropriate strategy 
table of contents changes based on this review 
the chairperson or his her designee is responsible for reviewing and reporting on the effects of the policy implementations and strategies to the board of directors at least monthly 
in order to manage our assets and liabilities and achieve the desired liquidity  credit quality  interest rate risk  profitability and capital targets  we have focused our strategies on maintaining an adequate level of adjustable rate loans  originating a reasonable volume of short and intermediate term loans  originating and selling a reasonable volume of fixed rate year and year one to four family residential mortgage loans in the secondary market  managing our deposits to establish stable deposit relationships  and using federal home loan bank advances and pricing on fixed term non core deposits to align maturities and repricing terms 
at times  depending on the level of general interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  the asset liability management committee may determine to increase our interest rate risk position somewhat in order to maintain our net interest margin 
the asset liability management committee regularly reviews interest rate risk by forecasting the impact of alternative interest rate environments on net interest income and market value of portfolio equity  which is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments  and evaluating such impacts against the maximum potential changes in net interest income and market value of portfolio equity that are authorized by the board of directors of simplicity bank 
an independent third party provided simplicity bank with the information presented in the following tables  which are based on information provided by simplicity bank 
the tables present the sensitivity of net interest income for the month period subsequent to the years ended june  and and the immediate  permanent and parallel movements in interest rates of  and basis points  as well as the change in simplicity bank s net portfolio value at june  that would occur upon an immediate change in interest rates without giving effect to any steps that management might take to counteract that change

table of contents change in interest rates basis points estimated npv estimated increase decrease in npv npv as a percentage of present value of assets npv ratio increase decrease basis points amount percent dollars in thousands assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities 
npv is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest earning assets 
npv ratio represents npv divided by the present value of assets 
the analysis uses certain assumptions in assessing the interest rate risk 
these assumptions relate to interest rates  loan prepayment rates  deposit decay rates  and the fair values of certain assets under differing interest rate scenarios  among others 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing tables 
for example  although assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in the market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features  that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  if interest rates change  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates of deposit could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table
