we have also developed two hepatitis c virus  or hcv  genotyping tests  a a a genotyping test and a c genotyping test  versions of which are available for research use only ruo 
we are also developing our next generation instrument system  or nexgen system 
we are designing the nexgen system to integrate automated nucleic acid extraction and amplification with our esensor detection technology to enable technicians using the nexgen system to be able to place a raw or a minimally prepared patient sample directly into our test cartridge and obtain results without any additional steps 
this sample to answer capability is enabled by the robust nature of our esensor detection technology  which is not impaired by sample impurities that we believe hinder competing technologies 
we are designing our nexgen system to further simplify workflow and provide powerful  cost effective molecular diagnostics solutions to a significantly expanded group of hospitals and reference laboratories 

table of contents since inception  we have incurred net losses from continuing operations each year  and we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
our losses attributable to continuing operations for the fiscal year ended december  and were approximately million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our operations to date have been funded principally through sales of capital stock  borrowings and cash from operations 
we expect to incur increasing expenses over the next several years  principally to develop our nexgen system and additional diagnostic tests  as well as to further increase our spending to manufacture  sell and market our products 
our strategy our goal is to become the market leading provider of automated  multiplex molecular diagnostic testing systems 
we intend to expand the use of our xt system and diagnostic tests targeting especially those reference laboratories and hospitals in the united states which perform a high volume of molecular diagnostic tests

laboratories using our xt system can expect to obtain test results within approximately minutes of receipt of the amplified dna sample  generally resulting in a total turnaround time of under four hours 
multiplex capability 
our xt system can detect up to separate biomarkers in a single test cartridge 
this allows laboratories to run multiple tests or panels on an individual patient sample in a one step detection process 
this capability reduces the time required for a laboratory to perform a diagnostic analysis that involves multiple genetic markers or infectious disease pathogens  which otherwise would require the laboratory to run multiple  separate molecular diagnostic tests 

table of contents prior to performing a test  a laboratory technician takes isolated dna from the patient sample and performs an automated nucleic acid extraction and amplification step with materials supplied with our test cartridge 
in some cases  the technician also performs a routine enzymatic treatment before adding our proprietary signal probes and transferring the solution into the sample compartment in our test cartridge 
the technician enters sample identification and reagent information into our xt system using the supplied bar code wand or on screen keyboard and inserts the test cartridge into an open slot on the analyzer 
the on board computer automatically assimilates input information and test cartridge information from the memory chip on the test cartridge and initiates the specified test protocol 
the testing process generally takes under four hours to complete  and in most cases the test results can be viewed on the built in touch screen monitor approximately minutes after the insertion of test cartridges into the instrument 
test results can also be printed out or reported through the laboratory s computer information system 
the key features of our xt system include key features characteristics fast turnaround approximately minutes to result from amplified dna sample with minimal technician time needed accurate results our cystic fibrosis genotyping test  our warfarin sensitivity test and our thrombophilia risk test demonstrated accuracy in clinical studies compared to dna sequencing and other standards ease of use intuitive touch screen interface and clear reports small footprint approximately inches in width and depth in its standard configuration random access each of up to test cartridge slots can be accessed independently minimal maintenance no routine maintenance or calibration required multiplex capability detects up to distinct biomarkers in a single sample our test menu we have developed eight diagnostic tests for use with our xt system  four of which have received clearance from the fda 
the majority of our revenues are derived from the sale of consumables reagents and test cartridges based on our proprietary esensor technology 
for the fiscal years ended december   and  consumables sales represented   and of our total revenues  respectively 
cystic fibrosis genotyping test 
our cystic fibrosis genotyping test is a multiplex genotyping test that detects a panel of mutations associated with cystic fibrosis based on guidelines published by the american college of medical genetics and the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists for screening of adult couples contemplating pregnancy 
our cystic fibrosis genotyping test demonstrated accuracy in clinical studies as compared to dna sequencing and other standards and delivers results within minutes of receipt of the amplified dna sample 
test results are summarized in an easy to interpret report that includes a summary carrier or non carrier determination as well as individual carrier status for each of the recommended markers 
our cystic fibrosis genotyping test received fda clearance in july our cystic fibrosis genotyping test addresses a market that was estimated in at over million in the united states alone 
more than million americans are carriers of one mutation of the cystic fibrosis gene 
the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists suggests that all couples who are considering having a child  or those who are expecting a child  should have genetic carrier testing for cystic fibrosis 
much of current cystic fibrosis testing is performed by national reference laboratories 
with the availability of highly accurate  easy to use cystic fibrosis tests  we expect that the market will continue to decentralize through regional reference laboratories and hospitals now capable of offering this test 
warfarin sensitivity test 
our warfarin sensitivity test is a multiplex pharmacogenetic test for the detection of three genetic markers that are known to play a critical role in the metabolism of  and sensitivity to  warfarin 
warfarin  offered under the brand name coumadin  is the most widely prescribed oral anticoagulant in north america and europe and is used to prevent heart attacks  strokes and blood clots in veins  arteries and lungs 
through detection of an individual s sensitivity to warfarin  doctors are better able to accurately and 
table of contents efficiently determine the appropriate warfarin dosage level on an individual patient basis 
our warfarin sensitivity test demonstrated accuracy in clinical studies compared to dna sequencing and other standards and delivers results within minutes of receipt of the amplified dna sample 
our warfarin sensitivity test received fda clearance in july thrombophilia risk test 
our thrombophilia risk test is a multiplex test for the detection of four common inherited genetic risk factors of thrombophilia factor v leiden  factor ii prothrombin and two genetic markers in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase mthfr gene 
thrombophilia is a condition where a person s blood clots easily or excessively placing them at risk of developing clots 
thrombophilia is a particular concern for high risk patients  including patients who are pregnant or undergoing certain surgeries 
our thrombophilia risk test demonstrated accuracy in clinical studies compared to dna sequencing and other standards and delivers results within minutes of receipt of the amplified dna sample 
our thrombophilia risk test received fda clearance in april thrombophilia is one of the most common types of blood coagulation disorders affecting in  individuals 
we believe the us market is approximately million based on statistics provided by kalorama information  a market research firm 
respiratory viral panel rvp test 
our respiratory viral panel test is a multiplex test for the detection of viruses  including influenza a hn and seasonal  influenza b  respiratory syncytial virus rsv and numerous other upper respiratory viruses 
our respiratory viral panel test received fda clearance in september respiratory pathogens are a major source of illness and can lead to hospitalizations and death 
according to the centers for disease control  each year in the united states  on average  to of the population gets the flu and more than  people are hospitalized from flu related complications 
in addition  over a period of years  estimates of flu associated deaths in the united states ranged from a low of approximately  to a high of approximately  rsv is the most common cause of bronchitis and pneumonia in infants and young children  with up to  children hospitalized annually in the united states 
one of the challenges faced by the physician assessing a patient with a respiratory illness is determining the underlying cause so that an effective treatment plan can be determined 
hepatitis c virus genotyping hcvg tests 
our hcv genotyping test and our hcvg direct test  each of which is currently labeled for research use only  are multiplex tests for the detection and typing subtyping of hcv a  b  a c  b    and according to the centers for disease control  hcv infection is the most common chronic blood borne infection in the united states with over million people considered chronically infected 
according to the world health organization  it is estimated that approximately million people are chronically infected with hcv globally and at risk of developing liver cirrhosis and or liver cancer  and more than  people die from hcv related liver diseases each year 
an article published in the annals of internal medicine found that  in the united states  hcv is cited as the cause of death more than hiv 
based on the current treatment guidelines for hcv  a patient s genotype is a component of selecting the proper treatment strategy as well as a predictor of the likelihood of treatment success 
a a genotyping test a a 
our a a genotyping test  currently labeled for research use only  is a multiplex test designed for the detection and genotyping of the b     and alleles of the cyp a gene locus  and the d    b     and alleles of the cyp a gene locus 
c genotyping test c 
our c genotyping test  currently labeled for research use only  is a multiplex test for the detection and genotyping of the          and alleles of the cytochrome p cyp c gene locus 

table of contents our tests in development and design once our nexgen system is introduced  we intend to launch two to four new tests annually 
we select these tests based upon what we believe are clinically relevant targets which address unmet market needs 
we are currently developing or designing the following diagnostic tests infectious disease test panels 
we are currently designing other infectious disease test panels that would align strategically with our existing respiratory viral panel test offering by leveraging our current and future system placements in the acute care setting 
the test panels we are designing fit into two categories genotyping tests for viruses such as hcv or detection tests for panels of viruses  bacteria or fungi such as lower respiratory tract infections 
genotyping tests are run throughout the year whereas many detection tests have a seasonal component 
in order to maximize the value of systems installed for infectious disease tests like our respiratory viral panel test  we may seek to develop a broad range of detection assays which have distinctly different seasonal peaks in prevalence to allow our customers to utilize our system for infectious disease testing throughout the year 
currently  several infectious disease panels and genotyping tests are in the design concept stage 
oncology and personalized medicine tests 
given the trend in oncology towards tailoring treatment to an individual s tumor type and the emerging interest in personalized medicine  we are currently researching and evaluating the development of test panels in these areas 
expanding our product offering into these two areas would align strategically with our existing products as well as development stage products by leveraging our current and future system placements in these laboratories 
our nexgen system we are highly focused on developing our nexgen system to provide a complete sample to answer solution for our customers 
the nexgen system is being designed to retain all the customer benefits of our xt system  while also integrating automated nucleic acid extraction and amplification processes 
these features will eliminate the need for time consuming and complex sample preparation steps and allow technicians to place a patient sample directly into our test cartridge 
we have already demonstrated feasibility of direct sample to answer on a nexgen prototype system 
we believe this advancement will make our esensor technology attractive to the broad range of institutions that currently lack the technical or economic resources to perform molecular diagnostic testing 
we believe the nexgen system will expand our target user base from approximately  to approximately  or more potential laboratories and hospitals in the united states 
we believe our approach to a sample to answer system will achieve benefits over many other competitive multiplex systems  including an ability to perform complex multiplex tests in a high throughput  random access  efficient and cost effective manner 
our technology our esensor technology our proprietary esensor technology is based on the principles of competitive dna hybridization and electrochemical detection 
dna naturally forms a double stranded structure  with each strand binding with high affinity  or hybridizing  only to a complementary strand 
our technology takes advantage of this highly specific binding by first creating two types of single stranded dna  the capture probe and the signal probe 
the capture probe and signal probe are each complementary to a different segment of the target dna  or biomarker  that is a focus of the diagnostic test 
using our proprietary technology and processes  we attach our capture probes to a proprietary monolayer on the surface of a gold electrode within our proprietary test cartridge 
we separately attach ferrocene  an electrochemically active label  to our signal probes 
before placing the sample into our test cartridge  the technician mixes the amplified dna sample with our signal probe 
if the target biomarker is present in the prepared patient sample  a segment of the biomarker dna 
table of contents will hybridize with a solution containing our signal probe 
this solution is then run past an electrode  against which our capture probes have been immobilized 
the as yet unbound segment of the target biomarker binds to our capture probe  creating a target dna  signal probe  capture probe complex at the surface of the electrode 
this complex produces an electrochemical signal analyzed and interpreted by our system 
our test cartridges currently have distinct electrodes  each of which can be configured to detect a different target biomarker  enabling multiplex testing 
our esensor technology is highly specific for the target biomarker  and is not based on optical or fluorescent detection 
as a result  our diagnostic tests are less prone to sample contamination risk and do not require many of the time consuming washing and preparation steps required by competing technologies 
the only sample preparation step required before using our xt test cartridges is a polymerase chain reaction  or pcr  amplification  which involves amplifying  or generating billions of copies of  the target dna molecules  followed by transfer of the sample to our test cartridge and insertion of the test cartridge into any open slot in our xt system 
in some tests  amplified dna is subject to an additional enzymatic treatment to produce a single stranded dna 
our xt test cartridges 
our xt test cartridges are self contained devices specifically programmed and configured for a given diagnostic test 
each test cartridge includes a sample compartment and a plastic cover that forms a hybridization chamber 
the test cartridge is fitted with a diaphragm pump and valves that circulate the hybridization solution  including the signal probe and prepared patient sample  when inserted into the xt system 
the test cartridge also includes a printed circuit board chip consisting of an array of gold plated working electrodes  a silver silver chloride reference electrode  and two gold plated auxiliary electrodes 
each electrode is customized with a proprietary monolayer that immobilizes the dna capture probes specific for each target of a test panel 
the test cartridge also contains an electrically erasable  programmable read only memory component that stores information related to the cartridge such as an assay identifier  cartridge lot number and expiration date 
our xt workstation 
our xt system is a multiplex workstation that has a modular design consisting of an integrated touch screen workstation and up to three analyzers 
each analyzer contains eight modules into which individual test cartridges are placed 
the test cartridge slots operate independently of each other allowing up to independent test cartridges to be loaded at one time  with the remaining slots available for use at any future time while the system is running 
each slot contains a test cartridge connector  a precision controlled heater  an air pump and electronics 
the air pumps drive the diaphragm pump and valve system in the test cartridge  eliminating fluid contact between the system and the cartridge 
the pneumatic pumping enables recirculation of the hybridization solution allowing the target dna and the signal probes to efficiently hybridize with the complementary capture probes on the electrodes 
the diaphragm pump in the test cartridge is connected to a pneumatic source from the xt system and provides unidirectional pumping of the hybridization mixture through the cartridge during hybridization 
the touch screen workstation controls each analyzer  provides power and analyzes and stores data 
technicians can load patient identification numbers and reagent lot codes by the included bar code scanner  the touch screen or uploading a text file from a usb memory stick 
advantages of our esensor electrochemical signal detection we believe our proprietary electrochemical signal detection technology has several advantages over other signal detection platforms  including robust signal 
our capture probes are highly target specific  reducing the binding of non target dna and  thereby  largely eliminating interference from other components in a patient s sample  such as blood  saliva or urine 
similarly  constituents of blood that would normally interfere with fluorescence detection  such as hemoglobin or bilirubin  have no effect on the processed electronic signals produced 
table of contents by our esensor technology 
we believe this robust functionality will facilitate the development of integrated amplification and sample to answer systems for blood and other sample types 
high sensitivity and accuracy 
our esensor technology is highly sensitive in the detection of nucleic acids 
each electrode can routinely detect approximately one nanomolar of target dna  and a sensitivity of picomolar of target dna has been achieved 
such concentrations are readily produced from patient samples using several commercially validated amplification technologies such as pcr 
our esensor technology has demonstrated accuracy in our cystic fibrosis genotyping test  our warfarin sensitivity test and our thrombophilia risk test in clinical studies compared to dna sequencing and other standards 
streamlined sample preparation 
our technology directly detects the target dna sequence with highly specific signal probes and electrode bound capture probes 
as a result  our test samples do not require many of the washing steps typically required to remove unbound target dna and labels 
we believe that our esensor technology can minimize sample preparation requirements 
we have already demonstrated direct pcr based genotyping from diluted whole blood without the need for dna sample preparation or washing out of interfering substances 
efficient multiplexing 
each of the electrodes in our test cartridge configuration acts independently of the others and produces a comprehensive and informative signal 
for example  a single esensor electrode can measure the presence or absence of control dna  which we use for quality control  and simultaneously indicate whether a patient sample contains zero  one or two copies of a particular sequence  corresponding to mutant  heterozygous or wild type genotypes 
as a result  our esensor technology eliminates the need for redundancy and the averaging of multiple measurements commonly required by competing technologies 
small footprint with low maintenance 
our esensor technology enables users to perform hybridization and detection in a low cost system with relatively few moving parts 
in contrast  conventional microarray systems require robotic instrumentation to automate multistage fluidic handling processes 
as a result  these systems are often bulky  complicated and expensive and require frequent calibration and maintenance 
our xt system  for example  requires no calibration and virtually no maintenance and is self contained in a small footprint of approximately by inches in its standard configuration 
cost effective development 
the use of electrochemical technology allows our xt system to leverage third party advances in microelectronics such as miniaturization and manufacturing efficiencies 
many electronic components associated with our core processes are produced in large volumes at low cost and size for use in numerous fields including automotive  aerospace  information technology and medical devices 
by avoiding the use of optical or fluorescent detection  we believe our esensor technology can be applied at low cost to numerous testing environments in addition to our current target markets  including field testing and point of care applications 
straightforward development of new tests 
our esensor technology is highly flexible  and we believe the main design consideration in developing new diagnostic tests for our instrument systems is our ability to access and synthesize the appropriate capture and signal probes 
our versatile platform allows us to add new diagnostic tests to our menu or to add new content to existing diagnostic tests without modifying the system platform 
this ease of assay development and our versatile platforms will allow us to focus our research and development resources on developing new commercial test products 
functionality outside of molecular diagnostics 
our esensor technology has broad applicability to detect a range of biomolecules 
independently  and through collaborative research with university and industry partners  we have demonstrated esensor detection of proteins and small molecule drugs 
this versatility opens the possibility of developing mixed analyte sensors  such as tests that can detect antibodies to a certain pathogen plus the pathogen itself  or genetic variations in drug metabolism plus monitoring of the drug level itself

under the terms of the agreement  we established a collaborative program with all to develop in vitro diagnostic products incorporating all s proprietary electro wetting technology in conjunction with our electrochemical detection 
we paid all an upfront license payment of  and agreed to pay up to  in potential additional milestone payments 
pursuant to the agreement  the parties agreed to enter into a supply agreement relating to the manufacture and supply of certain all components 
the agreement also provides that we would  upon the occurrence of certain events  be obligated to pay to all a royalty consisting of a low to mid single digit percent of net sales of designated licensed products containing all components which we manufacture or are otherwise not manufactured and supplied by all 
market opportunity we believe the global market for molecular diagnostics is currently approximately billion and will experience a growth rate of approximately per year over the course of the next several years based on research published by leading market research firms 
although we believe the global market for molecular diagnostics is approximately billion  our existing technology is suited to address a subset of this market that approximated billion in our xt instrument and related reagents are currently only sold in the us market 
we anticipate that our nexgen system currently under development would  when completed  expand the market opportunity for our technology so that we could address up to half of the total global market for molecular diagnostics 
we anticipate that the market for the molecular diagnostic tests on which our nexgen system will focus to increase by more than per year over the next several years 
many factors are driving growth of this market  including the expansion of genetic testing for disease predisposition  advances in 
table of contents personalized medicine  such as the tailoring of therapies to those individuals most likely to respond  and increased demand for infectious disease diagnostics panels 
the markets for pharmacogenetic testing  cancer diagnostics and infectious disease diagnostic panels are anticipated to grow at approximately  and per annum  respectively  over the next several years 
research and development as of december   we had employees focused on research and development 
our research and development expenditures were approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to expenses incurred in connection with our nexgen system development program  and to improve our product reliability and enhance our product effectiveness in software development and product technical support 
in addition to developing our nexgen system and expanding our diagnostic test menus  our research and development team is focused on the following initiatives improving the clinical and practical utility of our tests 
an important role of our research and development team is to help establish the clinical utility and value of our molecular diagnostic tests 
we have and intend to continue to partner with academic and reference laboratories to perform validation and clinical studies on our tests 
key aspects of our efforts are aimed at improving workflow in the laboratory setting  positively comparing our tests to historical or gold standard tests and demonstrating that our tests can help improve patient care and lower diagnostic and medical treatment costs 
we intend to publish the results from these clinical studies in peer reviewed or trade journals  submit them to regulatory bodies and present them at industry conferences in support of our commercialization strategy 
developing new test capabilities 
we are developing capabilities for utilizing our esensor technology in protein and small molecule detection  both independently and through research collaborations 
these capabilities may enhance our future menu offerings or provide us with out licensing opportunities 
we may also explore direct gene expression analysis opportunities through collaboration with oncology specialists in industry and academia 
these opportunities may allow us to develop quantitative tests that are competitive with the gold standard real time pcr tests but that are simple to perform in a multiplex manner 
manufacturing we manufacture our proprietary test cartridges and ancillary reagents at our headquarters in carlsbad  california 
we perform reagent formulation  test cartridge manufacturing and packaging of final components and test cartridges in accordance with applicable guidelines for medical device manufacturing 
we recently signed a lease amendment to increase our office and manufacturing facilities to approximately  square feet and believe these facilities will be adequate to meet our manufacturing needs for the foreseeable future 
we outsource manufacturing of our xt system to leica biosystems melbourne pty ltd  or leica 
we also rely on third party suppliers  including in certain instances sole source suppliers  for oligonucleotide and other raw materials used in our products and much of the disposable component molding and sub component assembly for our test cartridges 
we have implemented a quality management system designed to comply with fda regulations and iso standards governing diagnostic medical device products 
these regulations carefully control the design  manufacture  testing and release of diagnostics products  as well as raw material receipt and control 
in  our carlsbad  ca facility obtained iso certification 
we also have controlled methods for the consistent manufacturing of our proprietary test cartridges and reagents at our facilities 
our key outsourcing partners are generally iso certified to help assure a continual supply of high quality components 

table of contents we plan to continue to manufacture components that we determine are highly proprietary or highly customized  while outsourcing more commodity like components 
we are likely to establish additional outsourcing partnerships as we manufacture additional products 
sales and marketing our current sales and marketing strategy is to expand the installed base and utilization of our xt system and consumables 
our products are sold in the united states through a geographically dispersed direct sales and technical specialist service organization  which is supported by a centralized team of product managers and marketing  customer support  and technical support personnel 
our sales representatives typically have experience in molecular diagnostics and a network of laboratory contacts within their respective territories 
we utilize our representatives knowledge along with market research databases to target and qualify our customers 
we execute a variety of sales campaigns and strategies to meet the buying criteria of the different customer segments we serve 
to support our expanding molecular test menu  growth in our customer base and launch plans of our nexgen system  we continue to make investments in these customer facing organizations 
we believe the xt system competes largely on the basis of improved performance and reliability  ease of use and streamlined laboratory workflow  a high value test menu with multiplexing capabilities  and a superior return on investment 
these and other advantages conferred by our technology are enabling us to provide clinicians and researchers with superior molecular solutions 
our sales cycle typically includes customer evaluations and validations of our products 
upon successful validation  a customer can acquire our xt system and consumables in the following ways reagent rental the reagent rental agreement requires a customer commitment to purchase a minimum number of test cartridges over the term of the agreement  and a portion of the charge for each cartridge is a usage fee for the equipment 
our reagent rental agreements do not typically provide for any cancellation rights by the customer 
capital purchase the xt system is paid for upfront and in its entirety by the customer 
customers are also eligible to receive structured pricing incentives if they enter into an optional annual minimum cartridge commitment 
in  we intend to begin implementing our initial international commercialization strategy for our nexgen system  which we expect will involve a select network of partners and distributors 
we may seek to augment this effort with a team of our specialists to support our partners sales forces and provide technical support 
we also intend to explore opportunities to leverage our intellectual property position in molecular diagnostics through licensing or the establishment of partnerships 
customers in  only two customers  natural molecular testing corporation  or nmtc  and companion diagnostics  represented more than of our total revenue 
together  these customers represented approximately of our total revenues for the year ended december  in november  we entered into a four year agreement with nmtc for the purchase of our products 
in  one customer  nmtc  accounted for of our total revenue 
in  one customer  bioreference laboratories  accounted for of our total revenue 
placements are defined in terms of the number of analyzers sold to or placed with a customer  reflecting a direct correlation between the reagent test revenue opportunity and the number of test cartridges that can be analyzed at any one time 
as of december   we had placed analyzers at unique customer sites  or approximately analyzers per customer 
this compares with analyzer placements at unique customer sites  or approximately analyzers per customer  as of december  
table of contents the increase in analyzers placed and related revenue generated in over the prior year is due to an increase in the number of new customers buying our products and growth in the sale of consumables to existing customers 
we expect our clinical molecular diagnostic revenues to continue to increase in competition we primarily face competition in the molecular diagnostic testing markets with testing products and systems developed by public and private companies such as cepheid  siemens  hologic  inc  luminex corporation  nanosphere  inc  qiagen nv  roche diagnostics  a division of f 
hoffmann la roche ltd  biofire diagnostics  inc and abbott molecular diagnostics  a division of abbott laboratories 
our diagnostic tests also face competition with laboratory developed tests  or ldts  developed by national and regional reference laboratories and hospitals 
we believe that our xt system competes largely on the basis of accuracy and reliability  enhanced laboratory workflow  multiplex capability  ease of use and return on investment for customers 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  research and other resources and larger  more established marketing  sales and distribution organizations than we do 
many of our competitors also offer broader product lines and have greater brand recognition than we do 
moreover  our existing and new competitors may make rapid technological developments that may result in our technologies and products becoming obsolete before we recover the expenses incurred to develop them or before they generate significant revenue 
intellectual property to establish and protect our proprietary technologies and products  we rely on a combination of our patents  copyrights  trademarks  and trade secrets  as well as other intellectual property rights in our technology and business information 
our intellectual property portfolio for our core electrochemical technology was initially built through the combination of our acquisition of the clinical micro sensors business from motorola and licensing patents from third parties  including the california institute of technology and harvard university 
we believe that our patent portfolio  including approximately issued us and foreign patents and numerous pending applications  provides us with robust protection of our electrochemical detection techniques  chemical insulators and attachment points on electrode surfaces and other technology that  collectively  form the staple of our esensor platform 
we continue to pursue the issuance of new patents to protect our ongoing research  development and commercial activities  including with respect to our nexgen system 
in general  patents have a term of years from the application filing date or earlier claimed priority date 
a majority of our issued and exclusively licensed patents will expire between and  with approximately one half of the patents expiring by several of our pending applications have the potential to mature into patents that may expire between and our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to police infringement  derive licensing revenues and continue to develop proprietary products and technologies without infringing the intellectual property rights of others 
we also rely in part on trade secret protection of our intellectual property 
we attempt to protect our trade secrets by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties  employees and consultants 
our employees and consultants also sign agreements requiring that they assign to us their interests in intellectual property  such as patents and copyrights arising from their work for us 
all employees sign an agreement not to compete unfairly with us during their employment and upon termination of their employment through the misuse of confidential information 
we also have filed for registration  or obtained registration  in the us and other countries for marks used with our products and technology 
our trademarks registered in the us include esensor and genmark 

table of contents trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and  in other countries  for as long as it is registered 
registrations generally are for fixed but renewable terms 
government regulation the design  development  manufacture  testing and sale of our diagnostic products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities  principally the fda  and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies 
regulation by the fda in the united states  the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  or fdca  fda regulations and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern  among other things  medical device design and development  preclinical and clinical testing  premarket clearance or approval  registration and listing  manufacturing  labeling  storage  advertising and promotion  sales and distribution  export and import  and post market surveillance 
the fda regulates the design  manufacturing  servicing  sale and distribution of medical devices  including molecular diagnostic test kits and instrumentation systems 
failure to comply with applicable us requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions  such as fda refusal to approve pending applications  warning letters  product recalls  product seizures  total or partial suspension of production or distribution  injunctions  fines  civil penalties and criminal prosecution 
unless an exemption applies  each medical device we wish to distribute commercially in the united states will require marketing authorization from the fda prior to distribution 
the two primary types of fda marketing authorization applicable to a device are premarket notification  also called k clearance  and premarket approval  also called pma approval 
the type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device 
the fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes class i  ii or iii based on the degree of risk the fda determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the device s safety and effectiveness 
devices requiring fewer controls because they are deemed to pose lower risk are placed in class i or ii 
class i devices are deemed to pose the least risk and are subject only to general controls applicable to all devices  such as requirements for device labeling  premarket notification and adherence to the fda s current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp  and quality system requirements  as reflected in its qsr 
class ii devices are intermediate risk devices that are subject to general controls and may also be subject to special controls such as performance standards  product specific guidance documents  special labeling requirements  patient registries or postmarket surveillance 
class iii devices are those for which insufficient information exists to assure safety and effectiveness solely through general or special controls and include life sustaining  life supporting or implantable devices  devices of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health  or which present a potential  unreasonable risk of illness or injury 
most class i devices and some class ii devices are exempted by regulation from the k clearance requirement and can be marketed without prior authorization from the fda 
some class i devices that have not been so exempted and class ii devices are eligible for marketing through the k clearance pathway 
by contrast  devices placed in class iii generally require pma approval or k de novo clearance prior to commercial marketing 
the pma approval process is more stringent  time consuming and expensive than the k clearance process  however  the k clearance process has also become increasingly stringent and expensive 
the fda has cleared our xt system with our esensor warfarin sensitivity test  cystic fibrosis genotyping test  thrombophilia risk test and respiratory viral panel test as class ii devices via the k clearance process 
k clearance 
to obtain k clearance for a medical device  an applicant must submit a premarket notification to the fda demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a device legally marketed in the united states that is not subject to pma approval  commonly known as the predicate device 
a device is substantially equivalent if  with respect to the predicate device  it has the same intended use and has either i the 
table of contents same technological characteristics or ii different technological characteristics and the information submitted demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness 
a showing of substantial equivalence sometimes  but not always  requires clinical data 
generally  the k clearance process can exceed days and may extend to a year or more 
after a device has received k clearance for a specific intended use  any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness  such as a significant change in the design  materials  method of manufacture or intended use  may require a new k clearance or pma approval and payment of an fda user fee 
the determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available fda guidance  however  the fda may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until k clearance or pma approval is obtained 
the manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties 
before we can submit a medical device for k clearance  we may have to perform a series of generally short studies over a period of months  including method comparison  reproducibility  interference and stability studies to ensure that users can perform the test successfully 
some of these studies may take place in clinical environments  but are not usually considered clinical trials 
for pma submissions  we would generally be required to conduct a longer clinical trial over a period of years that supports the clinical utility of the device and how the device will be used 
although clinical investigations of most devices are subject to the investigational device exemption  or ide  requirements  clinical investigations of molecular diagnostic tests  including our products and products under development  are generally exempt from the ide requirements 
thus  clinical investigations by intended users for intended uses of our products generally do not require the fda s prior approval  provided the clinical evaluation testing is non invasive  does not require an invasive sampling procedure that presents a significant risk  does not intentionally introduce energy into the subject and is not used as a diagnostic procedure without confirmation by another medically established test or procedure 
in addition  certain of our products must be labeled per fda regulations for research use only ruo or for investigational use only iuo  and distribution controls must be established to assure that our products distributed for research  method comparisons or clinical evaluation studies are used only for those purposes 
pma approval 
a pma application requires the payment of significant user fees 
pma applications must be supported by valid scientific evidence  which typically requires extensive data  including technical  preclinical  clinical and manufacturing data  to demonstrate to the fda s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device 
a pma application must also include  among other things  a complete description of the device and its components  a detailed description of the methods  facilities and controls used to manufacture the device  and proposed labeling 
the fda has days from its receipt of a pma to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review 
once the submission is accepted for filing  the fda begins an in depth review 
during this review period  the fda may request additional information or clarification of information already provided 
in addition  the fda will conduct a pre approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the qsr  which requires manufacturers to follow design  testing  control  documentation and other quality assurance procedures 
fda review of an initial pma application is required by statute to take between six to ten months  although the process typically takes significantly longer  and may require several years to complete 
the fda can delay  limit or deny approval of a pma application for many reasons  including it is not demonstrated that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe or effective under the conditions of use prescribed  recommended or suggested in the proposed labeling  
table of contents the data from preclinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support approval  and the manufacturing process  methods  controls or facilities used for the manufacture  processing  packing or installation of the device do not meet applicable requirements 
if the fda evaluations of both the pma application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable  the fda will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter  which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the pma application 
if the fda s evaluation of the pma application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable  the fda will deny approval of the application or issue a not approvable letter 
a not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and  where practical  will identify what is necessary to make the application approvable 
the fda may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary  in which case the pma approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the pma application 
once granted  pma approval may be withdrawn by the fda if compliance with post approval requirements  conditions of approval or other regulatory standards are not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing 
approval by the fda of new pma applications or pma supplements may be required for modifications to the manufacturing process  labeling  device specifications  materials or design of a device that is approved through the pma process 
pma supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial pma application  except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original pma application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel 
regulation after fda clearance or approval 
any devices we manufacture or distribute pursuant to clearance or approval by the fda are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the fda and certain state agencies 
we are required to adhere to applicable regulations setting forth detailed cgmp requirements  as set forth in the qsr  which include  among other things  testing  control and documentation requirements 
non compliance with these standards can result in  among other things  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recalls or seizures of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the government to grant k clearance or pma approval of devices  withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecutions 
we have designed and implemented our manufacturing facilities under the fda s cgmp requirements 
because we are a manufacturer of medical devices  we must also comply with medical device reporting requirements by reviewing and reporting to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that one of our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury 
we must also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur 
labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and  in certain circumstances  by the federal trade commission 
medical devices approved or cleared by the fda may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses  otherwise known as off label promotion 
the fda and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses  and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability  including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution 
environmental regulations 
we are also subject to numerous federal  state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions  manufacturing practices  environmental protection  fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances 
some of these laws require us to obtain licenses or permits to conduct our operations 
we have numerous policies and procedures in place to ensure compliance with these laws and to minimize the risk of occupational exposure to hazardous materials 
we do not expect the operations of our products to produce significant quantities of hazardous or toxic waste or radiation that would require the use of extraordinary disposal practices 
although the costs to comply with these applicable laws and regulations have not been material  we cannot predict the impact on our business of new or amended laws or regulations or any changes in the way existing and future laws and regulations are interpreted or enforced  nor can we ensure we will be able to obtain or maintain any required licenses or permits 

table of contents export of our products 
export of products subject to the k notification requirements  but not yet cleared to market  is permitted with fda authorization provided certain requirements are met 
unapproved products subject to the pma approval requirements may be exported if the exporting company and the device meet certain criteria  including  among other things  that the device complies with the laws of the receiving country and the company submits a simple notification to the fda when the company begins to export 
if the company or device does not comply with such criteria  fda approval must be obtained for export 
to obtain fda export approval  if required  we must meet certain requirements  which may include documentation demonstrating that the product is approved for import into the country to which it is to be exported and  in some instances  safety data to demonstrate that export of the device will not be contrary to public health or safety 
clinical laboratory improvement amendments of the use of our products is also affected by the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of  or clia  and related federal and state regulations  which provide for regulation of laboratory testing 
any customers using our products for clinical use in the united states will be regulated under clia  which is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of laboratory testing in the united states 
in particular  these regulations mandate that clinical laboratories must be certified by the federal government or a federally approved accreditation agency  or must be located in a state that has been deemed exempt from clia requirements because the state has in effect laws that provide for requirements equal to or more stringent than clia requirements 
moreover  these laboratories must meet quality assurance  quality control and personnel standards  and they must undergo proficiency testing and inspections 
the clia standards applicable to clinical laboratories are based on the complexity of the method of testing performed by the laboratory  which range from waived to moderate complexity to high complexity 
we expect that most of our products will be categorized as high complexity  since most molecular diagnostic tests are currently fda cleared as clia high complexity devices 
foreign government regulation 
we intend to market our products in european and other selected international markets 
before doing so  we or our partners and distributors will need to receive regulatory approval 
the regulatory review process for medical devices varies from country to country  and many countries also impose product standards  packaging requirements  labeling requirements and import restrictions on devices 
each country has its own tariff regulations  duties and tax requirements 
failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements may subject a company to fines  suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals  product recalls  seizure of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecution 
third party payor reimbursements obtaining reimbursement approval for a health care product or service from a government or other third party payor is a time consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific  clinical and health economic data for the use of our products to the payor 
we may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to reimbursement 
even when a payor determines that a product or service is eligible for reimbursement  the payor may impose coverage limitations that preclude payment for some uses that are approved by the fda or comparable authorities 
in addition  there is a risk that full reimbursement may not be available for high priced products 
moreover  eligibility for coverage does not imply that any product or service will be reimbursed in all cases or at a rate that allows our customers to make a profit or cover their costs 
initial or interim reimbursements for products and services  if available  may also be insufficient to cover costs and may not be made permanent 
successful sales of our products in the united states and other countries will likely depend on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors such as private insurance plans  managed care organizations  and medicare and medicaid 
our customers have obtained reimbursement for our cystic fibrosis genotyping test  our thrombophilia risk test and our respiratory viral panel test for the xt system 
however  medicare and medicaid generally do not reimburse providers who use our warfarin sensitivity test 
outside of the united states  health care reimbursement systems vary from country to country  and to the extent we begin to sell our products outside the united states  we may not be able to obtain adequate reimbursement coverage  if any  for our products 

table of contents in addition  we may develop tests in the future that do not relate to previously established current procedural terminology  or cpt  codes and we may need to obtain new cpt codes in order to obtain reimbursement 
in january  the centers for medicare medicaid services  or cms  implemented new molecular diagnostic cpt codes and retired the prior procedural codes used to bill for molecular testing 
in february  two major medicare carriers issued new molecular pathology pricing codes 
certain tests to identify specific genes or analytes which have been regularly used by the medical community for a number of years and  in certain cases  established as a standard of care in making therapy decisions  including certain of the products we currently sell  were previously available for reimbursement under the prior coding system 
however  under the new coding system  some of these tests may now be denied reimbursement as investigational or experimental  or may be subject to significantly reduced reimbursement rates 
reimbursement by a third party payor depends on a number of factors  including applicable coverage policies and limitations  the level of demand by health care providers and the payor s determination that the use of a new product is medically necessary and represents a clinical advance 
in addition  both government and non government third party payors routinely limit reimbursement coverage and reimbursement amounts for diagnostic tests 
if our customers cannot receive sufficient levels of reimbursement when using our products  our ability to sell them could be significantly constrained 
fraud and abuse regulations we are subject to numerous federal and state health care anti fraud laws  including the federal anti kickback statute and false claims act that are intended to reduce waste  fraud and abuse in the health care industry 
these laws are broad and subject to evolving interpretations 
they prohibit many arrangements and practices that are lawful in industries other than health care  including certain payments for consulting and other personal services  some discounting arrangements  the provision of gifts and business courtesies  the furnishing of free supplies and services  and waivers of payments 
in addition  many states have enacted or are considering laws that limit arrangements between medical device manufacturers and physicians and other health care providers and require significant public disclosure concerning permitted arrangements 
these laws are vigorously enforced against medical device manufacturers and have resulted in manufacturers paying significant fines and penalties and being subject to stringent corrective action plans and reporting obligations 
we must operate our business within the requirements of these laws and  if we were accused of violating them  we could be forced to expend significant resources on investigation  remediation and monetary penalties 
patient protection and affordable care act our operations are affected by the federal patient protection and affordable care act of  as modified by the health care and education reconciliation act of  which we refer to as the health care act 
the health care act imposes a excise tax on sales of medical devices by manufacturers 
taxable devices include any medical device defined in section h of the fdca and intended for use by humans  with limited exclusions for devices purchased by the general public at retail for individual use 
there is no exemption for small companies  and we began paying the tax in january the health care act also requires manufacturers to report to the department of health and human services detailed information about financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals 
these reporting provisions preempt state laws that require reporting of the same information  but not those that require reports of different or additional information 
failure to comply subjects the manufacturer to significant civil monetary penalties 
employees as of december   we had employees 
approximately are involved in research and development  in operations  manufacturing and quality assurance  in sales and marketing  and in general and administrative functions 
our success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain employees 
we face competition in this regard from other companies  research and academic institutions  government entities and other organizations 
none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement

item a 
risk factors you should consider each of the following factors as well as the other information in this annual report in evaluating our business and our prospects 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business and financial results could be harmed 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
you should also refer to the other information set forth in this annual report  including our financial statements and the related notes 
we may not be successful in developing our nexgen system and its related test menu 
achieving profitability and our medium to long term growth projections will require the successful development and commercialization of our nexgen system and its related test menu 
we are designing this system to integrate automated nucleic acid extraction and amplification with our esensor technology to allow technicians to be able to place patient samples directly into our test cartridges and obtain results with significantly reduced or no technician hands on processing time 
the development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends  as well as precise technological execution 
in addition  the development of the nexgen system involves multiple technologies and third party collaboration partners  and we may not be successful in completing the development of all the currently intended features and benefits of the system or effectively managing the complexities of the development program 
although we have significant experience with our proprietary esensor electrochemical detection technology  we have not thus far developed a complete sample to answer diagnostic instrument system 
doing so will require the successful convergence of our esensor technology with a number of additional technologies with which we have limited knowledge and experience and for which we must rely on a number of collaboration partners 
for example  in july  we entered into a development collaboration and license agreement with advanced liquid logic  inc  or all  which established a collaborative program to develop in vitro diagnostic products incorporating all s proprietary electro wetting technology in conjunction with electrochemical detection 
we also rely upon our collaboration partners to assist us with other technical aspects of our nexgen development program 
while we have signed agreements with each of our collaboration partners  we cannot completely control the resources our collaboration partners dedicate to our nexgen development program 
if any of our corporate collaborators were to breach or terminate its agreement with us or otherwise fail to conduct its collaborative activities successfully  in a timely manner or on budget  or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in effectively managing the complexities of our nexgen development program  the development or commercialization of our nexgen system could be delayed or terminated  or could cost significantly more than our current estimates 

table of contents our financial results will depend on the acceptance and increased demand among reference laboratories  hospitals and the medical community of our molecular diagnostic technology and products 
our future success depends on the acceptance by our target customers and the medical community that our molecular diagnostic products are a reliable  medically relevant  accurate and cost effective replacement for other molecular diagnostic testing methods 
medical offices and many hospitals outsource their molecular diagnostic testing needs to national or regional reference laboratories 
our business success depends on our ability to convince these target laboratories and hospitals to perform these tests internally with our products if they have historically outsourced their testing needs  or to replace their current testing platforms with our system and its related test offerings 
many other factors may affect the market acceptance and commercial success of our molecular diagnostic technology and products  including the relative convenience and ease of use of our diagnostic systems over competing products  the introduction of new technologies and competing products that may make our technologies and products a less attractive solution for our target customers  the breadth of our menu of available diagnostic tests relative to our competitors  our success in training reference and hospital based laboratories in the proper use of our products  the acceptance in the medical community and key opinion leaders of our molecular diagnostic technology and products  the extent and success of our marketing and sales efforts  and general economic conditions 
professional societies  government agencies  practice management groups  private health science foundations and organizations involved in healthcare issues may publish guidelines  recommendations or studies to the healthcare and patient communities 
recommendations of government agencies or these other organizations may relate to such matters as usage  cost effectiveness and use of related products 
organizations like these have in the past made recommendations about our competitors products  such as the need for less frequent screening tests  which could result in reduced product sales 
moreover  the perception by the investment community or stockholders that recommendations  guidelines or studies will result in decreased use of our products could adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock 
if third party payors do not reimburse our customers for the use of our products or if reimbursement levels are set too low for us to sell our products at a profit  our ability to sell our products and our results of operations will be harmed 
we sell our products to hospital based and reference laboratories  substantially all of which receive reimbursement for the health care services they provide to their patients from third party payors  such as medicare  medicaid  other domestic and foreign government programs  private insurance plans and managed care programs 
reimbursement decisions by particular third party payors depend upon a number of factors  including each third party payor s determination that use of a product is a covered benefit under its health plan  appropriate and medically necessary for the specific indication  cost effective  and neither experimental nor investigational 

table of contents third party payors may deny reimbursement for covered products if they determine that a medical product was not used in accordance with cost effective diagnosis methods  as determined by the third party payor  or was used for an unapproved indication 
third party payors also may refuse to reimburse for procedures and devices deemed to be experimental or investigational 
obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product from each government or third party payor is a time consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific  clinical and cost effectiveness data for the use of our product to each government or third party payor 
we may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement 
for example  medicare and medicaid generally do not reimburse providers who use our warfarin sensitivity test 
in addition  eligibility for coverage does not imply that any product will be covered and reimbursed in all cases or reimbursed at a rate that allows our potential customers to make a profit or even cover their costs 
further  third party payors may choose to reimburse our customers per test based on individual biomarker detection  rather than on the basis of the number of results given by the test 
this may result in reference laboratories  public health institutions and hospitals electing to use separate tests to screen for each disease so that they can receive reimbursement for each test they conduct 
in that event  these entities may purchase separate tests for each disease  rather than products  such as ours  that can be used to return multiple test results 
in the united states  the american medical association  or ama  generally assigns specific billing codes for laboratory tests under a coding system known as current procedure terminology  or cpt  codes  which are necessary for our customers to bill and receive reimbursement for our diagnostic tests 
once the cpt code is established  cms  which is responsible for implementing the medicare program  establishes payment levels and coverage rules under medicare 
private payors establish rates and coverage rules independently 
we cannot guarantee that any of our tests are or will be covered by the cpt codes that we believe may be applied to them or that any of our tests or other products will be approved for coverage or reimbursement by medicare  medicaid or any third party payor 
third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services 
increasingly  medicare  medicaid and other third party payors are challenging the prices charged for medical services  including clinical diagnostic tests 
in addition  payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation 
in february  president obama signed the middle class tax relief and job creation act of  which mandated an additional change in reimbursement for clinical laboratory services payments 
this legislation requires cms to reduce the medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule by in  which in turn will serve as a base for and subsequent years 
levels of reimbursement may continue to decrease in the future  and future legislation  regulation or reimbursement policies of third party payors may harm the demand and reimbursement available for our products  which in turn  could harm our pricing and sales 
if our customers are not adequately reimbursed for our products  they may reduce or discontinue purchases of our products  which would cause our revenues to decline 
in january  cms implemented new molecular diagnostic cpt codes and retired the prior procedural codes used to bill for molecular testing 
in february  two major medicare carriers issued new molecular pathology pricing codes 
certain tests to identify specific genes or analytes which have been regularly used by the medical community for a number of years and  in certain cases  established as a standard of care in making therapy decisions  including certain of the products we currently sell  were previously available for reimbursement under the prior coding system 
however  under the new coding system  some of these tests may now be denied reimbursement as investigational or experimental  or may be subject to significantly reduced reimbursement rates 
if the clinical validity and utility of these tests cannot be established to the satisfaction of insurance carriers and third party payors  or the level of reimbursement for these tests is significantly reduced  some of our customers would be negatively affected  which  in turn  would adversely affect our revenues 

table of contents our revenue  results of operations and cash flows would suffer upon the loss of a significant customer 
we have a few large customers that generate a significant amount of our revenue 
our two largest customers  nmtc and companion diagnostics  accounted for approximately of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended december  while we have signed contracts with our significant customers  we may lose a significant customer if any existing contract with such customer expires without being extended  renewed  renegotiated or replaced or is terminated by the customer prior to expiration  to the extent such early termination is permitted by the applicable contract  or if the customer is unable to perform its obligations due to bankruptcy or other financial distress 
the loss of any significant customer or a significant reduction in the amount of product ordered by any of our significant customers would adversely affect our revenue  results of operations and cash flows 
we have a history of net losses  and we may never achieve or maintain profitability 
we have a history of significant net losses and a limited history commercializing our molecular diagnostic products 
we obtained fda clearance for our first generation molecular diagnostic system in  and commenced a limited marketing effort for this system 
we initially offered our xt system and our warfarin sensitivity test in july  our cystic fibrosis genotyping test in july  our thrombophilia risk test in april  and our respiratory viral panel test in september our net losses were approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue to incur significant expenses for the foreseeable future in connection with our ongoing operations  primarily related to our commercial organization sales and marketing  research and development and regulatory activities  maintaining our existing intellectual property portfolio  obtaining additional intellectual property rights and investing in corporate infrastructure 
although we believe that we will become cash flow positive over the next few years  we cannot provide any assurance that we will achieve profitability and  even if we achieve profitability  that we will be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
further  because of our limited commercialization history and the rapidly evolving nature of our target market  we have limited insight into the trends that may emerge and affect our business 
we may make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends  which could harm our business and financial condition 
although we have recently remediated a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting  if we are unable to maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls  our financial results may not be accurately reported 
management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december  reported a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the supervision and review of our financial closing and reporting process  as described in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  during  we devoted significant time and resources to the remediation of the material weakness that included  but was not limited to evaluating our finance department s management and staff qualifications  which resulted in us making certain personnel changes  including the replacement of our chief financial officer  controller and certain accounting staff  redesigning and implementing structured and formalized internal control procedures  implementing new control procedures over the utilization of external resources  and developing and initiating a plan for the deployment of additional software systems to assist in automating and controlling certain financial processes 
although further and ongoing efforts will continue in and beyond to enhance our internal control over financial reporting  we believe that our remediation efforts now provide the foundation for compliance with the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso framework 
as a result  our 
table of contents assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december  no longer reports this material weakness or any other material weakness over financial reporting  and the audit report of our independent registered public accounting firm no longer expresses an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december  internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
because the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting cannot guarantee the prevention or detection of a material weakness  we can never guarantee a material weakness over financial reporting will not occur  including with respect to any previously reported material weaknesses 
any future material weakness could result in material misstatements in our financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
in addition  if we or our auditors are unable to certify that our internal control over financial reporting is effective  we may be subject to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities such as the sec or the nasdaq global market  and we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which would materially harm our business  the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets 
disruptions in the supply of raw materials  consumable goods or other key product components  or issues associated with their quality from our single source suppliers  could result in a significant disruption in sales and profitability 
we must manufacture  or engage third parties to manufacture  components of our products in sufficient quantities and on a timely basis  while maintaining product quality  acceptable manufacturing costs and complying with regulatory requirements 
our components are custom made by only a few outside suppliers 
in certain instances  we have a sole source supply for certain key product components 
if we are unable to satisfy our forecasted demand from existing suppliers for our kits and are unable to find alternative suppliers at reasonably comparable prices  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  we have entered into supply agreements with most of our suppliers of strategic reagents and parts to help ensure component availability and flexible purchasing terms with respect to the purchase of such components 
if our suppliers discontinue production of a key component for one or more of our products  we may be unable to identify or secure a viable alternative on reasonable terms  or at all  which could limit our ability to manufacture our products 
in determining the required quantities of our products and the manufacturing schedule  we must make significant judgments and estimates based on inventory levels  current market trends and other related factors 
because of the inherent nature of estimates and our limited experience in marketing our products  there could be significant differences between our estimates and the actual amounts of products we require 
this can result in shortages if we fail to anticipate demand  or excess inventory and write offs if we order more than we need 
reliance on third party manufacturers entails risk to which we would not be subject if we manufactured these components ourselves  including reliance on third parties for regulatory compliance and quality assurance  possible breaches of manufacturing agreements by the third parties because of factors beyond our control  possible regulatory violations or manufacturing problems experienced by our suppliers  possible termination or non renewal of agreements by third parties  based on their own business priorities  at times that are costly or inconvenient for us  the potential obsolescence and or inability of our suppliers to obtain required components  the potential delays and expenses of seeking alternate sources of supply or manufacturing services  
table of contents the inability to qualify alternate sources without impacting performance claims of our products  reduced control over pricing  quality and timely delivery due to the difficulties in switching to alternate suppliers or assemblers  and increases in prices of raw materials and key components 
the manufacturing operations for our test cartridges use highly technical processes involving unique  proprietary techniques 
in addition  the manufacturing equipment we use would be costly to repair or replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace 
any interruption in our operations or decrease in the production capacity of our manufacturing facility or the facilities of any of our suppliers because of equipment failure  natural disasters such as earthquakes  tornadoes and fires  or otherwise  would limit our ability to meet customer demand for the xt system and tests and would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the event of a disruption  we may lose customers and we may be unable to regain those customers thereafter 
our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
we have limited sales and marketing experience and are currently reliant on the commercial success of our xt system and its related test menu to fund our current operations and development programs 
we currently market our xt instrument system and four fda cleared diagnostic tests 
in addition  we have several diagnostic tests in the research  development or design stage 
we have primarily placed our xt systems with customers at no initial charge through reagent rental agreements  under which customers commit to purchase minimum quantities of test cartridges and reagents consumables over a period of generally one to three years  with a component of the cartridge and reagent price allocated to recover the instrument price 
we also offer our xt systems for sale 
we expect sales of consumables associated with our xt system will account for the vast majority of our revenues for at least the next several years 
we intend to continue to dedicate a significant portion of our resources to the commercialization of our xt system and its related test menu  while also dedicating significant resources to the development of our nexgen system and its related test menu 
as a result  to the extent that our xt system and our existing and future diagnostic and research products are not commercially successful or are withdrawn from the market for any reason  our operating results  financial condition and critical development programs would be harmed and we may be required to seek additional funding to support our ongoing operations 
in addition  we have limited marketing  sales and distribution experience and capabilities 
our ability to achieve profitability depends on attracting customers for the xt system and its related test menu and building brand loyalty 
to successfully perform sales  marketing  distribution and customer support functions ourselves  we face a number of risks  including our ability to attract and retain the skilled support team  marketing staff and sales force necessary to commercialize and gain market acceptance for our technology and our products  the ability of our sales and marketing team to identify and penetrate the potential customer base  including hospitals and national and regional reference laboratories  and the difficulty of establishing brand recognition and loyalty for our products 
some hospital based and reference laboratories may not consider adopting our xt system unless we offer a broader menu of diagnostic tests or may choose not to convert from competitive products unless and until we are able to offer a sample to answer instrument solution  such as our nexgen instrument 
in addition  in order to commercialize our products  we are required to undertake time consuming and costly development activities  including clinical studies for which the outcome is uncertain 
products that appear promising during early development and preclinical studies may  nonetheless  fail to demonstrate the results needed to support regulatory approval or  if approved  may not generate the demand we expect 
if we are unable to effectively 
table of contents compete with our xt system and its related test menu  our revenues and our ability to achieve profitability will be significantly impaired 
we face intense competition from established and new companies in the molecular diagnostics field and expect to face increased competition in the future 
the markets for our technologies and products are highly competitive and we expect the intensity of competition to increase 
we compete with many companies in the united states engaged in the development  commercialization and distribution of similar products intended for clinical molecular diagnostic applications 
categories of our competitors include companies developing and marketing multiplex molecular diagnostics systems  including luminex corporation  nanosphere  inc  biofire diagnostics  qiagen nv  abbott molecular diagnostics  a division of abbott laboratories  and hologic  inc  large hospital based laboratories and reference laboratories who provide large scale testing using their own proprietary testing methods  including quest diagnostics incorporated and laboratory corporation of america  and companies that manufacture laboratory based tests and analyzers  including cepheid  siemens  hologic  inc  qiagen nv  biofire diagnostics  roche diagnostics  a division of f 
hoffmann la roche ltd  and abbott molecular diagnostics 
our diagnostic tests also face competition from ldts developed by national and regional reference laboratories and hospitals 
such ldts may not be subject to the same regulatory requirements  including those requiring clinical trials and fda review and clearance or approval that may apply to our diagnostic products 
we anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter the market with new technologies and our competitors improve their current products and expand their menu of diagnostic tests 
many of our current competitors  as well as many of our potential competitors  have greater name recognition  more substantial intellectual property portfolios  longer operating histories  significantly greater resources to invest in new technologies  more substantial experience in new product development  greater regulatory expertise  and more extensive manufacturing and distribution capabilities 
it is critical to our success that we anticipate changes in technology and customer requirements and successfully introduce enhanced and competitive technology to meet our customers and prospective customers needs on a timely basis 
if we fail to effectively compete and keep pace with emerging technologies  our systems and related tests will become uncompetitive and our market share will decline  which would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the regulatory clearance or approval process for certain products is expensive  time consuming and uncertain  and the failure to obtain and maintain required clearances or approvals could prevent us from commercializing our products 
we are investing in the research and development of our nexgen instrument and related diagnostic tests to expand our future product offerings 
our diagnostic products are subject to k clearance or pre market approval by the fda prior to their marketing for commercial use in the united states  and to any approvals required by foreign governmental regulations  directives and or entities prior to their marketing outside the united states 
in addition  any changes or modifications to a device that has received regulatory clearance or approval that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness  or would constitute a major change in its intended use  may require the submission of a new application for k clearance  pre market approval or foreign regulatory approvals 
our products are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal  state and foreign governmental authorities 
the process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals and to affix the ce mark 
table of contents to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming 
in particular  the fda permits commercial distribution of a new medical device only after the device has received clearance under section k of the fdca  or is the subject of an approved pma  unless the device is specifically exempt from those requirements 
it generally takes from four to twelve months from submission to obtain k clearance  and from one to three years from submission to obtain premarket approval  however  it may take longer  and k clearance or premarket approval may never be obtained 
similarly  we may not be able to obtain ce certificates of conformity necessary to affix the ce mark on our medical devices on a timely basis  if at all 
the fda will clear marketing of a lower risk medical device through the k process if the manufacturer demonstrates that the new product is substantially equivalent to other k cleared products 
high risk devices deemed to pose the greatest risk  such as life sustaining  life supporting  or implantable devices  or devices not deemed substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device  require the approval of a pma 
the pma process is more costly  lengthy and uncertain than the k clearance process 
a pma must be supported by extensive data  including  but not limited to  technical  preclinical  clinical trial  manufacturing and labeling data  to demonstrate to the fda s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device for its intended use 
the fda also recently initiated a review of the pre market clearance process in response to internal and external concerns regarding the k program 
in january  the fda announced action items designed to make the process more rigorous and transparent 
some of these proposals  if enacted  could impose additional regulatory requirements upon us which could delay our ability to obtain new k clearances  increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain our current clearances 
in addition  an important part of the european union  or eu  conformity assessment process prior to ce marking of medical devices is a review of related clinical data 
while a prospective clinical study may not be required in the eu  all medical devices must have accompanying clinical data 
the extent of this data is dictated by the classification of the device 
implantable devices and certain devices classified as class iii devices require clinical investigations to be performed unless it is duly justified to rely on existing clinical data 
delays in receipt of  or failure to obtain  clearances or approvals for future products  including our nexgen system and products that are currently in design or development  would result in delayed  or no  realization of revenues from such products and in substantial additional costs  which could decrease our profitability 
we have limited experience in filing fda applications for k clearance and pre market approval and in securing foreign governmental authorizations 
in addition  we are required to continue to comply with applicable fda and other regulatory requirements once we have obtained clearance or approval for a product 
there can be no assurance that we will obtain or maintain any required clearance or approval on a timely basis  or at all 
any failure to obtain or any material delay in obtaining clearance or approval of our products by the fda or relevant foreign regulatory bodies  or any failure to maintain compliance with fda or foreign regulatory requirements  could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from the sale of ruo tests 
under the terms of recent fda guidance  the marketing of our ruo tests to certain clinical laboratory customers for use as ldts may be limited if the fda were to change its existing policy of exercising enforcement discretion with respect to ldts 
accordingly  if the fda imposes significant changes to the regulation or enforcement of ldts  including our ruo tests that are used as ldts  it may be more challenging for us to market some of our ruo products and we may be required to terminate those ruo product sales  conduct clinical studies and make submissions of our ruo products to the fda for clearance or approval  which could reduce our revenues or increase our costs and adversely affect our operations or financial condition 
legislative or regulatory healthcare reforms may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
federal and state governments in the united states are also undertaking efforts to control growing health care costs through legislation  regulation and voluntary agreements with medical care providers and third party payors 
in march  congress enacted the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the 
table of contents health care and education reconciliation act  or the ppaca 
while the ppaca involves expanding coverage to more individuals  it includes new regulatory mandates and other measures designed to constrain medical costs 
among other requirements  the ppaca also imposes a excise tax on sales of medical devices by manufacturers that is expected to cost the medical device industry up to billion over the next decade 
taxable devices include any medical device defined in section h of the fdca and intended for use by humans  with limited exclusions for devices purchased by the general public at retail for individual use 
there is no exemption for small companies  and we began paying the tax in complying with ppaca could significantly increase our tax liabilities and costs  which could adversely affect our business and financial condition 
in august  the president signed into law the budget control act of  which may result in such changes as aggregate reductions to medicare payments to providers of up to per fiscal year  starting in the full impact on our business of the ppaca and the budget control act is uncertain 
we cannot predict whether other legislative changes will be adopted  if any  or how such changes would affect the medical device industry generally 
our products could infringe patent rights of others  which may require costly litigation and  if we are not successful  could cause us to pay substantial damages or limit our ability to commercialize our products 
our commercial success depends on our ability to develop  manufacture and market our systems and tests and use our proprietary technology without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties 
as the molecular diagnostic industry expands and more patents are issued  the risk increases that there may be patents issued to third parties that relate to our products and technology of which we are not aware or that we must challenge to continue our operations as currently contemplated 
our products may infringe or may be alleged to infringe these patents 
in addition  patent applications in the united states and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until eighteen months after filing 
for this reason  and because publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries  we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our issued patents or our pending applications or that we were the first to invent the technology 
another party may have filed or may in the future file patent applications covering our products or technology similar to ours 
under the first to invent rules applicable to patents filed before march  any such patent application may have priority over our patent applications or patents  which could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies 
if another party has filed a us patent application on inventions similar to ours  we may have to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the us patent and trademark office  or pto  to determine priority of invention in the united states 
the costs of these proceedings could be substantial  and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful if the other party had independently arrived at the same or similar invention prior to our own invention  resulting in a loss of our us patent position with respect to such inventions 
there is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device  biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries generally 
from time to time we may become engaged in litigation with third parties having patent or other intellectual property rights alleging that our products or proprietary technologies infringe their intellectual property rights 
if a third party claims that we or any collaborator infringes its intellectual property rights  we may face a number of issues  including  but not limited to infringement and other intellectual property claims which  regardless of merit  may be expensive and time consuming to litigate and may divert our management s attention from our core business  substantial damages for infringement  which we may have to pay if a court decides that the product at issue infringes on or violates the third party s rights  and if the court finds that the infringement was willful  we could be ordered to pay treble damages and the patent owner s attorneys fees  
table of contents a court prohibiting us from selling or licensing our product unless the third party licenses its product rights to us  which it is not required to do  if a license is available from a third party  we may have to pay substantial royalties  upfront fees or grant cross licenses to intellectual property rights for our products  and redesigning our products or processes so they do not infringe  which may not be possible or may require substantial monetary expenditures and time 
some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources 
in addition  any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations 
if we are unable to obtain  maintain and enforce intellectual property protection covering our products  others may be able to make  use or sell products substantially the same as ours  which could adversely affect our ability to compete in the market 
our commercial success is dependent in part on obtaining  maintaining and enforcing intellectual property rights  including patents 
if we are unable to obtain  maintain and enforce intellectual property protection covering our products  others may be able to make  use or sell products that are substantially the same as ours without incurring the sizeable development and licensing costs that we have incurred  which would adversely affect our ability to compete in the market 
we seek to obtain and maintain patents and other intellectual property rights to restrict the ability of others to market products that compete with our products 
currently  our patent portfolio is comprised  on a worldwide basis  of over issued us and foreign patents and numerous pending applications 
in general  patents have a term of years from the application filing date or earlier claimed priority date 
a majority of our issued and exclusively licensed patents will expire between and  with approximately one half of the patents expiring by several of our pending applications have the potential to mature into patents that might expire between and however  patents may not be issued based on any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us and  moreover  issued patents owned or licensed to us now or in the future may be found by a court to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable 
also  even if our patents are determined by a court to be valid and enforceable  they may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from marketing products similar to ours or designing around our patents  despite our patent rights  nor provide us with freedom to operate unimpeded by the patent rights of others 
we have also licensed certain intellectual property from third parties related to our products  and we rely on them to file and prosecute patent applications and maintain patents and otherwise protect the licensed intellectual property 
we have not had and do not have primary control over these activities for certain of our patents or patent applications and other intellectual property rights 
we cannot be certain that such activities by third parties have been or will be conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations or will result in valid and enforceable patents and other intellectual property rights 
pursuant to the terms of the license agreements with some of our licensors  the licensors may have the right to control enforcement of our licensed patents or defense of any claims asserting the invalidity of these patents and even if we are permitted to pursue such enforcement or defense  we will require the cooperation of our licensors 
we cannot be certain that our licensors will allocate sufficient resources or prioritize their or our enforcement of such patents or defense of such claims to protect our interests in the licensed patents 
if we fail to comply with our material obligations under any of our patent license agreements  the licenses may be terminated and we could lose license rights that are important to our business 
furthermore  additional licenses we may need may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  which could adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects 
the patent positions of medical device companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved 
no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in patents in these fields has emerged to date in the united states or in many foreign 
table of contents jurisdictions 
both the us supreme court and the court of appeals for the federal circuit have made  and will likely continue to make  changes in how the patent laws of the us are interpreted 
in addition  there are numerous recent changes to the patent laws and proposed changes to the rules of the pto  which may have a significant impact on our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual property rights 
for example  in september the united states enacted sweeping changes to the us patent system under the leahy smith america invents act  including changes that would transition the united states from a first to invent system to a first to file system and alter the processes for challenging issued patents 
these changes may materially affect the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents and patents of our collaborators and licensors 
the patent situation in the medical device and diagnostic fields outside the united states is even more uncertain 
we have a number of foreign patents and applications 
however  the laws of some foreign jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the united states  and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in obtaining  protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions 
if we encounter such difficulties or we are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions  our business prospects could be substantially harmed 
we also rely on trade secret protection to protect our interests in proprietary know how and for processes for which patents are difficult to obtain or enforce 
we may not be able to protect our trade secrets adequately 
we have limited control over the protection of trade secrets used by our licensors  collaborators and suppliers 
although we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets  our employees  consultants  contractors  outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors 
enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using any of our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming  and the outcome is unpredictable 
in addition  courts outside the united states are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets 
we rely  in part  on non disclosure and confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and other parties to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary technology 
these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
moreover  others may independently develop equivalent proprietary information  and third parties may otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge 
any disclosure of confidential data into the public domain or to third parties could allow our competitors to learn our trade secrets and use the information in competition against us 
we may need to raise additional funds in the future  and such funds may not be available on a timely basis  or at all 
until such time  if ever  as we can generate positive cash flows from operations  we will be required to finance our operations with our cash resources 
we may need to raise additional funds in the future to support our operations 
we cannot be certain that additional capital will be available as needed  on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we require additional capital at a time when investment in our company  in molecular diagnostics companies or the marketplace in general is limited  we may not be able to raise such funds at the time that we desire  or at all 
if we do raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible securities  the percentage ownership of holders of our common stock could be significantly diluted 
in addition  newly issued securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock 
if we obtain debt financing  a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness  and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations and place encumbrances on our assets 
if we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements  we could be required to relinquish significant rights to our technologies and products  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 

table of contents if we are unable to retain key members of our senior management and scientists or hire additional skilled employees  we may be unable to achieve our goals 
our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our senior management 
competition for top management personnel is intense and we may not be able to recruit and retain the personnel we need 
our senior managers can terminate their relationship with us at any time 
the loss of services of any of these key personnel could significantly reduce our operational effectiveness and investor confidence and our stock price could decline 
we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our employees 
in addition  our product development and marketing efforts could be delayed or curtailed if we are unable to attract  train and retain highly skilled technical employees and scientific advisors 
to expand our research  product development and sales efforts  we will need to retain additional people skilled in areas such as electrochemical and molecular science  information technology  manufacturing  sales  marketing and technical support 
because of the complex and technical nature of our systems and the dynamic market in which we compete  any failure to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially harm our ability to develop and commercialize our technology 
we may not be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel  and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to manage our anticipated growth  and we may experience constraints or inefficiencies caused by unanticipated acceleration and deceleration of customer demand 
demand for our respiratory viral panel test can be seasonal based upon influenza outbreaks 
also  unanticipated changes in customer demand for our products may result in constraints or inefficiencies related to our manufacturing  sales force  implementation resources and administrative infrastructure 
these constraints or inefficiencies may adversely affect us as a result of delays  lost potential product sales or loss of current or potential customers due to their dissatisfaction 
similarly  over expansion or investments in anticipation of growth that does not materialize  or develops more slowly than we expect  could harm our financial results and result in overcapacity 
to manage our anticipated future growth effectively  we must enhance our manufacturing capabilities and operations  information technology infrastructure  and financial and accounting systems and controls 
organizational growth and scale up of operations could strain our existing managerial  operational  financial and other resources 
our growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects  such as the development of new products or enhancements of existing products 
if our management is unable to effectively manage our growth  our expenses may increase more than expected  our revenue could grow more slowly than expected and we may not be able to achieve our research and development and commercialization goals 
our failure to manage our anticipated growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
we may have difficulties scaling our manufacturing operations and may experience manufacturing delays or component shortages that could limit the growth of our revenue 
to date  we have produced our products in limited quantities relative to the quantities necessary to achieve our desired revenue growth 
we recently completed a facility expansion project designed to increase our future manufacturing capabilities 
nevertheless  we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of our products or maintain consistency between differing lots of consumables 
if we encounter difficulties in scaling our manufacturing operations as a result of  among other things  quality control and quality assurance issues and availability of components and raw material supplies  we will likely experience reduced sales of our products  increased repair or re engineering costs due to product returns  and defects and increased expenses due to switching to alternate suppliers  any of which would reduce our revenues and gross margins 

table of contents although we attempt to match our parts inventory and production capabilities to estimates of marketplace demand  to the extent system orders materially vary from our estimates  we may experience continued constraints in our systems production and delivery capacity  which could adversely impact revenue in a given fiscal period 
should our need for raw materials and components used in production continue to fluctuate  we could incur additional costs associated with either expediting or postponing delivery of those materials 
we and our suppliers  contract manufacturers and customers are subject to various governmental regulations  and we may incur significant expenses to comply with  and experience delays in our product commercialization as a result of  these regulations 
our manufacturing processes and facilities  and those of some of our contract manufacturers  must comply with the federal quality system regulation  or qsr  which covers the procedures and documentation of the design  testing  production  control  quality assurance  labeling  packaging  sterilization  storage and shipping of our devices 
the fda enforces the qsr through periodic announced and or unannounced inspections of manufacturing facilities 
we and our contract manufacturers have been  and anticipate in the future being  subject to such inspections  as well as to inspections by other federal and state regulatory agencies 
we must also file reports of device corrections and removals and adhere to the fda s rules on labeling and promotion 
the fda and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses  and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability  including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution 
failure to comply with applicable fda requirements  or later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products or manufacturing processes  including our failure or the failure of one of our contract manufacturers to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse qsr inspection  can result in  among other things administrative or judicially imposed sanctions  injunctions or the imposition of civil penalties  recall or seizure of our products  total or partial suspension of production or distribution  withdrawal or suspension of marketing clearances or approvals  clinical holds  warning letters  refusal to permit the import or export of our products  and criminal prosecution 
any of these actions  in combination or alone  could prevent us from marketing  distributing or selling our products and would likely harm our business 
in addition  a product defect or regulatory violation could lead to a government mandated or voluntary recall by us 
we believe that the fda would request that we initiate a voluntary recall if a product was defective or presented a risk of injury or gross deception 
regulatory agencies in other countries have similar authority to recall devices because of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture that could endanger health 
any recall would divert management attention and financial resources  could cause the price of our shares of common stock to decline and expose us to product liability or other claims  including contractual claims from parties to whom we sold products  and harm our reputation with customers 
a recall involving our xt system or our diagnostic tests would be particularly harmful to our business and financial results 

table of contents the use of our diagnostic products by our customers is also affected by clia and related federal and state regulations that provide for regulation of laboratory testing 
clia is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the united states by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications  administration  participation in proficiency testing  patient test management  quality assurance  quality control and inspections 
current or future clia requirements or the promulgation of additional regulations affecting laboratory testing may prevent some laboratories from using some or all of our diagnostic products 
if our products do not perform as expected or the reliability of the technology on which our products are based is questioned  our operating results and business would suffer 
our success depends on the market s confidence that we can provide reliable  high quality diagnostic products 
we believe that customers in our target markets are likely to be particularly sensitive to product defects and errors 
as a result  our reputation and the public image of our products or technologies will be significantly impaired if our products fail to perform as expected 
although our diagnostic systems are designed to be user friendly  the functions they perform are complex and our products may develop or contain undetected defects or errors 
we currently manufacture our proprietary test cartridges at our carlsbad  california manufacturing facility 
we outsource manufacturing of our xt system and much of the disposable component molding for our test cartridges 
in the third quarter of  we formalized our relationship with leica  the contract manufacturer of our xt instrument system 
leica specializes in manufacturing of electronic and electromechanical devices for medical use 
while we work closely with leica to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability  we cannot guarantee that these efforts will be successful 
if we experience a material defect or error in our products  this could result in loss or delay of revenues  increased costs  delayed or reduced market acceptance  damaged reputation  diversion of development and management resources  legal claims  increased insurance costs or increased service and warranty costs  any of which could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we also face the risk of product liability exposure related to the sale of our products 
we currently carry product liability insurance that covers us against specific product liability claims 
we also carry a separate general liability and umbrella policy that covers us against certain claims but excludes coverage for product liability 
any claim in excess of our insurance coverage  or for which we do not have insurance coverage  would need to be paid out of our cash reserves  which would harm our financial condition 
we cannot assure you that we have obtained sufficient insurance or broad enough coverage to cover potential claims 
also  we cannot assure you that we can or will maintain our insurance policies on commercially acceptable terms  or at all 
a product liability claim could significantly harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to correctly estimate or control our future operating expenses  which could lead to cash shortfalls 
our operating expenses may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
these factors include the time and resources required to develop  and conduct clinical studies and obtain regulatory clearances for  additional diagnostic tests  the expenses we incur for research and development required to maintain and improve our technology  including developing our nexgen system  the costs of preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs  including litigation costs and the results of such litigation  
table of contents the expenses we incur in connection with commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution expenses  the expenses we incur in licensing biomarkers from third parties to expand the menu of diagnostics tests we plan to offer  our sales strategy and whether the revenues from sales of our test cartridges or xt system will be sufficient to offset our expenses  the costs to attract and retain personnel with the skills required for effective operations  and the costs associated with being a public company 
our budgeted expense levels are based in part on our expectations concerning future revenues from sales of our xt system and its related test menu 
we may be unable to reduce our expenditures in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in revenue 
accordingly  a shortfall in demand for our products could have an immediate and material impact on our business and financial condition 
we incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies in the united states  and failure to comply with these laws could harm our business and the price of our common stock 
as a public company listed in the united states  we incur significant legal  accounting and other expenses 
in addition  changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including regulations implemented by the sec and the nasdaq global market  may increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming 
these laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations and  as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies 
we intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards  and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management s time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
if we nevertheless fail to comply with new laws  regulations and standards  regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed 
current economic conditions and the uncertain economic outlook may adversely impact our business  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
global economic conditions may remain challenging and uncertain for the foreseeable future 
these conditions not only limit our access to capital but also make it extremely difficult for our customers  our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities  and they could cause us and foreign businesses and consumers to slow spending on our products and services  which would delay and lengthen sales cycles 
some of our customers rely on government research grants to fund technology purchases 
if negative trends in the economy affect the government s allocation of funds to research  there may be less grant funding available for certain of our customers to purchase technologies from us 
certain of our customers may face challenges gaining timely access to sufficient credit or may otherwise be faced with budget constraints  which could result in decreased purchases of our products or in an impairment of their ability to make timely payments to us 
if our customers do not make timely payments to us  we may be required to assume greater credit risk relating to those customers  increase our allowance for doubtful accounts and our days sales outstanding would be negatively impacted 
although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and such losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we may not continue to experience the same loss rates that we have in the past  especially given the current turmoil of the worldwide economy 
additionally  these economic conditions and market turbulence may also impact our suppliers causing them to be unable to supply in a timely manner sufficient quantities of customized components  thereby impairing our ability to manufacture on schedule and at commercially reasonable costs 

table of contents providing xt systems to our customers through reagent rental agreements may harm our liquidity 
the majority of our xt systems are provided to customers via reagent rental agreements  under which customers are afforded the right to use the xt system in return for a commitment to purchase minimum quantities of reagents and test cartridges over a period of time 
accordingly  we must either incur the expense of manufacturing xt systems well in advance of receiving sufficient revenues from test cartridges to recover our expenses or obtain third party financing sources for the purchase of our xt systems 
the amount of capital required to provide these systems to customers depends on the number of systems placed 
our ability to generate capital to cover these costs depends on the amount of our revenues from sales of reagents and test cartridges sold through our reagent rental agreements 
we do not currently sell enough reagents and test cartridges to recover all of our fixed expenses  and therefore we currently have a net loss 
if we continue not to sell a sufficient number of reagents and test cartridges to offset our fixed expenses  our liquidity will continue to be adversely affected 
we use hazardous chemicals  biological materials and infectious agents in our business 
any claims relating to improper handling  storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly 
our research  product development and manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  including chemicals  biological materials and infectious disease agents 
our operations produce hazardous waste products 
we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resulting injury from these materials 
we may be sued for any injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties of these materials  and our liability may exceed our insurance coverage and our total assets 
federal  state and local laws and regulations govern the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these hazardous materials and specified waste products  as well as the discharge of pollutants into the environment and human health and safety matters 
our operations are regulated and may require that environmental permits and approvals be issued by applicable government agencies 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive and may impair our research  development and production efforts 
if we fail to comply with these requirements  we could incur substantial costs  including civil or criminal fines and penalties  clean up costs or capital expenditures for control equipment or operational changes necessary to achieve and maintain compliance 
in addition  we cannot predict the impact on our business of new or amended environmental laws or regulations or any changes in the way existing and future laws and regulations are interpreted and enforced 
our corporate structure may create tax inefficiencies 
as a result of our reorganization in and prior to the reorganization steps that took place in june as described below  osmetech was a wholly owned subsidiary of genmark and a controlled foreign corporation for us federal investments of osmetech that otherwise would not be currently taxable under general tax rules may have become taxable 
in addition  conveyance of intellectual property rights from one subsidiary to another could create taxable income 
distributions from genmark to its operating subsidiaries or amongst the us operating subsidiaries of genmark could have been subject to additional us and foreign income tax withholding and result in lower profits 
during the quarter ended june   the company underwent a corporate reorganization intended to simplify its us entity structure 
as part of the reorganization  osmetech technologies  inc merged into clinical micro sensors  inc  with clinical micro systems  inc surviving 
additionally  osmetech plc converted to a uk limited company for uk legal and tax purposes and made an entity classification election to be treated as an entity disregarded from genmark diagnostics  inc for us federal income tax purposes 
the reorganization did not trigger any material us federal or us income tax expense 
in september  as one of the final steps in the reorganization  we filed to liquidate osmetech plc 
it is anticipated that the post reorganization structure will allow genmark diagnostics  inc to elect to file a consolidated us federal income tax return with its remaining us subsidiaries  clinical micro systems  inc and osmetech  inc as a result of these steps  all operations will be included in a us federal consolidated tax return and many of the inefficiencies described above will be eliminated on a going forward basis  however  the reorganization may result in additional tax liabilities to us 

table of contents our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited 
as of december   we had net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately million for us federal income tax purposes 
these loss carryforwards will expire in varying amounts through section of the us internal revenue code  as amended  or the code  generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of nol carryforwards that might be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in stock ownership 
we have determined that we have experienced multiple ownership changes under section of the code 
as of december   we estimated that approximately million of us federal net operating losses may be utilized in the future based on limitations that we have calculated under section of the code 
our ability to use the current nol carryforwards may also be limited by the issuance of common stock in the future 
to the extent our use of nol carryforwards is limited  our income may be subject to corporate income tax earlier than it would if we were able to use nol carryforwards 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred net assets 
we also had non us nol carryforwards of approximately million as of december  as a result of osmetech plc entering into liquidation  our expectation is that the million of non us nol carryforwards will not be utilized and  therefore  we have not accounted for them as a deferred tax asset 
we are exposed to risks associated with long lived and intangible assets that may become impaired and result in an impairment charge 
the carrying amounts of long lived and intangible assets are affected whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any asset may not be recoverable 
these events or changes might include an inability to successfully deliver an instrument to the marketplace and attain customer acceptance  a change in the rights or use of licensed intellectual property or other matters 
adverse events or changes in circumstances may affect the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be derived from long lived and intangible assets 
if at any time we determine that an impairment has occurred  we will be required to reflect the impaired value as a charge  resulting in a reduction in earnings in the quarter such impairment is identified and a corresponding reduction in our net asset value 
in the past we have incurred  and in the future we may incur  impairment charges 
a material reduction in earnings resulting from such a charge could cause us to fail meet the expectations of investors and securities analysts  which could cause the price of our stock to decline 
information technology systems implementation issues or security threats could disrupt our internal operations and adversely affect our financial results 
portions of our information technology infrastructure may experience interruptions  delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with ongoing systems implementation work 
in particular  we have implemented an enterprise resource planning software system 
to more fully realize the potential of this system  we are continually reassessing and upgrading processes and this may be more expensive  time consuming and resource intensive than planned 
any disruptions that may occur in the operation of this system or any future systems or any unauthorized access to our information systems could increase our expenses and adversely affect our ability to report in an accurate and timely manner the results of our consolidated operations  our financial position and cash flows and to otherwise operate our business in a secure environment  all of which could adversely affect our financial results  stock price and reputation 
we are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse  including anti kickback  self referral  false claims and fraud laws  and any violations by us of such laws could result in fines or other penalties 
our commercial  research and other financial relationships with healthcare providers and institutions are subject to various federal and state laws intended to prevent health care fraud and abuse 
the federal anti 
table of contents kickback statute prohibits the knowing offer  receipt or payment of remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of patients or the use of products or services that would be paid for in whole or part by medicare  medicaid or other federal health care programs 
remuneration has been broadly defined to include anything of value  including cash  improper discounts  and free or reduced price items and services 
many states have similar laws that apply to their state health care programs as well as private payors 
violations of the anti kickback laws can result in exclusion from federal health care programs and substantial civil and criminal penalties 
the federal false claims act  or the fca  imposes liability on persons who  among other things  present or cause to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal health care program 
the fca has been used to prosecute persons submitting claims for payment that are inaccurate or fraudulent  that are for services not provided as claimed  or for services that are not medically necessary 
if our marketing  sales or other arrangements  including our reagent rental arrangements  were determined to violate anti kickback or related laws  including the fca  then our revenues could be adversely affected  which could likely harm on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
beginning in  the ppaca also imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for payments to healthcare providers and ownership of their stock by healthcare providers 
failure to submit required information may result in significant civil monetary penalties 
we expect compliance with the ppaca to impose significant administrative and financial burdens on us 
in addition  there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians for marketing 
some states  such as california  massachusetts and vermont  mandate implementation of corporate compliance programs  along with the tracking and reporting of gifts  compensation and other remuneration to physicians 
the shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance and or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements 
state and federal authorities have aggressively targeted medical device companies for alleged violations of these anti fraud statutes  based on improper research or consulting contracts with doctors  certain marketing arrangements that rely on volume based pricing  off label marketing schemes and other improper promotional practices 
companies targeted in such prosecutions have paid substantial fines in the hundreds of millions of dollars or more  have been forced to implement extensive corrective action plans  and have often become subject to consent decrees severely restricting the manner in which they conduct their business 
if we become the target of such an investigation or prosecution based on our contractual relationships with providers or institutions  or our marketing and promotional practices  we could face similar sanctions which would materially harm our business 
to the extent we commence commercial operations overseas  we will be subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act  or the fcpa  and other countries anti corruption anti bribery regimes  such as the uk bribery act 
the fcpa prohibits improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
safeguards we implement to discourage improper payments or offers of payments by our employees  consultants  sales agents or distributors may be ineffective  and violations of the fcpa and similar laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions  or other liabilities or proceedings against us  any of which would likely harm our reputation  business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be unsuccessful in our long term goal of expanding sales of our product offerings outside the united states 
assuming we receive the applicable regulatory approvals  we intend to market our diagnostic products outside the united states through third party distributors 
these distributors may not commit the necessary resources to market and sell our products to meet our expectations 
if distributors do not perform adequately or in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in particular geographic areas  or if we are unable to locate 
table of contents distributors in particular geographic areas  our ability to realize revenue growth based on sales outside the united states would be harmed 
in order to market our products in the european union and many other foreign jurisdictions  we  or our distributors or partners  must obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements regarding safety and efficacy and governing  among other things  clinical studies and commercial sales and distribution of our products 
the approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing 
the regulatory approval process outside the united states may include all of the risks associated with obtaining fda approval  as well as additional risks 
in addition  in many countries outside the united states  a product must be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country 
we may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the united states on a timely basis  if at all  which could harm our ability to expand into markets outside the united states 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law could make an acquisition of our company  which may be beneficial to our stockholders  more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove the current members of our board and management 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage  delay or prevent a merger  acquisition or other change of control that stockholders may consider favorable  including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares 
furthermore  these provisions could prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove members of our board of directors 
these provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock  thereby depressing the market price of our common stock 
stockholders who wish to participate in these transactions may not have the opportunity to do so 
these provisions allow the authorized number of directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors  provide that our stockholders may remove our directors only for cause  establish a classified board of directors  such that not all members of the board of directors may be elected at one time  authorize our board of directors to issue without stockholder approval up to  shares of common stock  that  if issued  would dilute our stock ownership and could operate as a poison pill to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer to prevent an acquisition that is not approved by our board of directors  authorize our board of directors to issue without stockholder approval up to  shares of preferred stock  the rights of which will be determined at the discretion of the board of directors that  if issued  could operate as a poison pill to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer to prevent an acquisition that is not approved by our board of directors  require that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting or by unanimous written consent  establish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations to our board of directors or for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings  limit who may call stockholder meetings  and require the approval of the holders of of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote in order to amend certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws 
in addition  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which may  unless certain criteria are met  prohibit large stockholders  in particular those owning or more of the voting rights on our common stock  from merging or combining with us for a prescribed period of time

overview genmark diagnostics  inc  or genmark  plc  was formed by osmetech plc or osmetech as a delaware corporation in february genmark had no operations prior to its initial public offering  which was completed in june immediately prior to the closing of the initial public offering  genmark acquired all of the outstanding ordinary shares of osmetech in a reorganization under the applicable laws of the united kingdom 
as a result of the reorganization  all of the issued ordinary shares in osmetech were cancelled in consideration of i the issuance of common stock of genmark to the former shareholders of osmetech  and ii the issuance of new shares in osmetech to genmark 
following the reorganization  osmetech became a wholly owned subsidiary controlled by genmark  and the former shareholders of osmetech received shares of genmark 
once the reorganization became effective  all stock options granted under the osmetech plc us equity compensation plan  long term incentive awards and all warrants issued were exchanged for options and warrants exercisable for the common stock of the genmark 
any historical discussion of genmark relates to osmetech and its consolidated subsidiaries prior to the reorganization 
in september  genmark placed osmetech into liquidation to simplify its corporate structure 
we are a molecular diagnostics company focused on developing and commercializing our proprietary esensor detection technology 
our proprietary electrochemical technology enables fast  accurate and highly sensitive detection of up to distinct biomarkers in a single sample 
our xt system received k clearance from the fda and is designed to support a broad range of molecular diagnostic tests with a compact and easy to use workstation and self contained  disposable test cartridges 
within approximately minutes of receipt of an extracted and amplified nucleic acid sample  our xt system produces clear and accurate results 
our xt system supports up to independent test cartridges  each of which can be run independently  resulting in a highly convenient and flexible workflow for our target customers  which are hospitals and reference laboratories 
as of december   we had an installed base of analyzers  or placements  with our customers 
since inception  we have incurred net losses from continuing operations each year  and we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
our losses attributable to continuing operations for the years ended december   and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our operations to date have been funded principally through sales of capital stock  borrowings and cash from operations 
we expect to incur increasing expenses over the next several years  principally to develop our nexgen system and additional diagnostic tests  as well as to further increase our spending to manufacture  sell and market our products 
our products and technology we have developed eight tests for use with our xt system and may expand this test menu 
four of our diagnostic tests have received fda clearance  including our cystic fibrosis genotyping test  which detects genetic changes associated with cystic fibrosis  our warfarin sensitivity test  which determines an individual s 
table of contents ability to metabolize the oral anticoagulant warfarin  our thrombophilia risk test  which detects an individual s increased risk of blood clots  and our respiratory viral panel test  which simultaneously detects and differentiate clinically relevant viruses from patients with influenza like illnesses 
our respiratory viral panel test received k clearance from the fda in september our esensor technology has demonstrated accuracy in clinical studies compared to dna sequencing and other standards in our cystic fibrosis genotyping test  our warfarin sensitivity test and our thrombophilia risk test 
we also have developed two hcv genotyping tests  a a a genotyping test and a c genotyping test  versions of which are available for research use only ruo 
we are also developing our nexgen system 
we are designing the nexgen system to integrate automated nucleic acid extraction and amplification with our esensor detection technology to enable technicians using the nexgen system to be able to place a raw or a minimally prepared patient sample directly into our test cartridge and obtain results without any additional steps 
this sample to answer capability is enabled by the robust nature of our esensor detection technology  which is not impaired by sample impurities that we believe hinder competing technologies 
we are designing our nexgen system to further simplify workflow and provide powerful  cost effective molecular diagnostics solutions to a significantly expanded group of hospitals and reference laboratories 
revenue revenue from continuing operations includes product sales  principally of our diagnostic tests for use with our xt system 
we primarily place our xt system with customers through a reagent rental agreement  under which customers commit to purchasing minimum quantities of reagents and test cartridges over a period of one to three years 
we also offer our xt system for sale 
revenue also includes licensing revenue from the out licensing of our electrochemical detection technology 
in addition  revenue generated from service agreements recognized using the proportional performance method of accounting is included in this category 
we may enter into additional sub licenses of our technology generating additional revenue  but do not anticipate that this will provide a significant portion of our future revenue 
our growth plans focus primarily on reagent rental agreements with some sales of our current xt system and eventual sales of our nexgen system that is currently under development 
we do not anticipate any sales of our nexgen system in we plan to expand our base of customers and systems as well as add more tests for use with our existing and placed systems 
we believe these developments will drive accelerated use of our test cartridges  which we expect to be our primary source of revenue 
cost of sales cost of sales includes the cost of materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead costs used in the manufacture of our consumable test kits for our xt system  including royalties on product sales 
cost of sales also includes depreciation on revenue generating systems that have been placed with our customers under a reagent rental agreement  amortization of licenses related to our products and other costs such as warranty  royalty and customer technical support 
we manufacture our test cartridges in our facility and have recently invested in significant capacity for expansion 
this potential underutilized capacity may result in a high cost of sales relative to revenue  if manufacturing volumes are not able to fully absorb operating costs 
our xt systems are procured from a contract manufacturer and generally capitalized as fixed assets and depreciated on a straight line basis over their useful life as a charge to cost of sales 
we expect our cost of sales to increase as we place additional xt systems and manufacture and sell an increasing menu of accompanying diagnostic tests  however  we expect our gross margins to increase as manufacturing efficiencies  improved procurement practices  instrument reliability increases and other improvements decrease costs as a percentage of sales 

table of contents sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses include those costs associated with our direct sales force  sales management  marketing  technical support and business development activities 
these expenses primarily consist of salaries  commissions  benefits  share based compensation  travel  advertising  promotions  samples and trade shows 
we expect sales and marketing costs to increase as we scale up our commercial efforts to drive an increased customer base 
research and development expenses research and development expenses primarily include expenses related to the development of our nexgen system  including expanding the menu of our instrument test cartridges 
these expenses also include certain clinical study expenses incurred in the process of preparing for fda clearance for these products  intellectual property costs and quality assurance expenses 
the expenses primarily consisted of salaries  benefits  share based compensation costs  outside design and consulting services  laboratory supplies  contract research organization expenses  clinical study supplies and facility costs 
we expense all research and development costs in the periods in which they are incurred 
we expect research and development costs to increase as we develop our nexgen system and increase the development of new tests for our instrument systems 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses include expenses related to our executive  accounting and finance  compliance  information technology  legal  facilities  human resource  administrative and investor relations activities 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits  share based compensation costs  independent auditor costs  legal fees  consultants  travel  insurance  and public company expenses  such as stock transfer agent fees and listing fees for nasdaq 
foreign exchange gains and losses transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the prevailing rates on the dates of the transaction 
foreign exchange gains and losses arise from differences in exchange rates during the period between the date a transaction denominated in a foreign currency is consummated and the date on which it is settled or translated 
prior to our initial public offering in  exchange gains and losses included those arising on cash balances held by osmetech denominated in currencies other than its functional currency  the british pound 
since the initial public offering  the functional currency of genmark has been the us dollar 
since the initial public offering  foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily related to amounts due under a single license agreement  which are denominated in euros 
interest income and interest expense interest income includes interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and investments 
interest expense represents interest incurred on our loan payable and on other liabilities 
provision for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with asc accounting standards codification topic  income taxes 
under asc topic  deferred taxes are provided on an asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss carryforwards 
deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the tax bases 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 

table of contents critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates revenue we recognize revenue from product sales and contract arrangements  net of discounts and sales related taxes 
we recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
where applicable  all revenue is stated net of sales taxes and trade discounts 
we offer customers the choice to either purchase a system outright or to receive a system free of charge in exchange for an annual minimum purchase commitment for diagnostic test cartridges 
when a system is sold  revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of the unit consistent with contract terms 
when a system is placed free of charge under a reagent rental agreement  we retain title to the equipment and the system remains capitalized on the balance sheet under property and equipment 
under our reagent rental agreements  our customers pay a system usage fee  which is included in each test cartridge purchased 
our reagents and diagnostic test cartridges are priced to include the system usage and maintenance of the system and are included in product revenue in our consolidated financial statements 
we sell our durable systems and disposable test cartridges primarily through a direct sales force in the united states 
the system price is not dependent upon the purchase of any amount of disposable test cartridges 
revenue on system and test cartridge sales is generally recognized upon shipment consistent with contract terms  which is when title and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer and there are no other post shipment obligations 
revenue related to royalties received from licenses is generally recognized evenly over the contractual period to which the license relates 
revenue from service agreements is recognized using the proportional performance method of accounting 
in those cases where we bill shipping and handling costs to customers  the amounts billed are classified as other revenue 
property and equipment net property  equipment and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight line method over the assets estimated useful lives  which are noted below 
we generally capitalize our xt systems  and provide these to customers for no charge 
each category of property and equipment is analyzed to determine its useful life 
we look at the manufacturers estimates of useful life and adjust these for actual experience in our operating environment 
useful lives are reviewed periodically and occasionally changed as circumstances dictate 
machinery and laboratory equipment years instruments years office equipment years leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining life of the lease or the useful economic life of the asset repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
long term investment in july  we purchased  in preferred stock of a collaborative development and licensing partner and reported the amount in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as an other long term asset 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets we assess the recoverability of long lived assets  including intangible assets and systems at customer locations by periodically evaluating the carrying value of such assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
if impairment is indicated  we write down the carrying value of the asset to the estimated fair value 
in the years ended december  and  no impairment charges were recorded 
share based compensation we grant stock options with an exercise price equal to the closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq global market on each grant date 
we use the black scholes option pricing model as the method for determining the estimated fair value of stock options 
the black scholes model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions which determine the fair value of share based awards  including the option s expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
these assumptions include expected term 
our expected term represents the period that our share based awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined by evaluating past experience and using other estimating tools 
expected volatility 
expected volatility represents the volatility in our stock price expected over the expected term of the option 
expected dividend 
the black scholes option pricing model calls for a single expected dividend yield as an input 
we assumed no dividends as we have never paid dividends and have no current plans to do so 
risk free interest rate 
the risk free interest rate used in the black scholes option pricing model is based on published government rates in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of the option 
the compensation expense related to the grant of restricted stock is calculated as the difference between the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant  less the cost to acquire the shares  which is per share 
income taxes our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
we are currently subject to income taxes only in the united states but have been subject to income taxes in both the united states and the united kingdom in previous years 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our consolidated income tax expense 
we believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in recognition of this risk  we have provided a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets relating to our net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
if our assumptions change and we determine that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets  the tax benefits relating to any reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets at december  will be accounted for as a reduction of income tax expense 
changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with asc topic and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the 
table of contents complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 
recent accounting pronouncements from time to time  new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board  or the fasb  or other standard setting bodies that we adopt as of the specified effective date 
we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations upon adoption 
in may  the fasb issued asu no 
 amendment to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss  or asu  updating asc topic  fair value measurement 
this guidance clarifies existing fair value guidance and expands disclosure requirements on  among other things  fair value measurements using level unobservable inputs 
level unobservable inputs refer to prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable ie supported by little or no market activity 
this guidance requires disclosures of quantitative information about the inputs used in level valuations  the valuation process used  and the sensitivity of the fair value measurements to changes in unobservable inputs 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements  fair value of financial instruments for more description on fair value measurements using level unobservable inputs 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   and is to be applied prospectively 
our adoption of this guidance effective january  resulted in additional disclosures in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  but did not have a material quantitative effect 
in june  the fasb issued asu  presentation of comprehensive income  updating asc topic  comprehensive income 
under the amended asc topic  an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the guidance eliminates the option to present other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of stockholders equity 
this guidance does not change the components that are recognized in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
in december  the fasb issued asu  deferral of the effective date for the amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
 updating asc topic  comprehensive income 
this guidance defers changes in asu that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments 
the guidance in asu and asu is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   and is to be applied retrospectively 
the company conformed its presentation which did not have a material impact on the presentation of the consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued asu  reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the amendment of this update requires an entity to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in net income if the amount being reclassified is required under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap to be reclassified in its entirety to net income 
for other amounts that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting period  an entity is required to cross reference other disclosures required under us gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts 
the amendments do not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements 
the adoption of the guidance is not expected to have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements and is not expected to have an impact on the company s future operating results 

table of contents results of operations compared to december  change change revenue the increase in revenue for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily related to the increase in consumable reagent and test cartridge revenues 
consumable revenue increased approximately  or  to approximately  for the year ended december  from approximately  in this increase in reagent revenue was primarily driven by an increase in the test offerings available on our xt instrument and a increase in the number of our installed base of analyzers to at december   from analyzer placements as of december  also  our average annuity per analyzer increased from approximately  per analyzer per year at december  to approximately  per analyzer per year at december  pricing changes were not a material cause of our significant increase in revenue 
the increase was not attributable to any one assay  however  our pharmacogenetics and infectious disease assay revenue increased significantly more than our other assay panels 
in addition to the increase in reagent consumables revenue  higher instrument sales during the year ended december  resulted in an additional  of revenue over we anticipate that our xt consumable and instrument revenues will continue to grow  however  we expect to experience increased revenue growth rates after we introduce our nexgen system and its related tests 
december  change change cost of sales gross profit loss the increase in cost of sales for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily related to the increase in consumable reagent and test cartridge revenues 
the improvement to gross profit of  was primarily due to increased sales volumes and manufacturing efficiencies 
the increase in volume  particularly in the fourth quarter of with the addition of our respiratory viral panel and a a tests  allowed us to increase absorption of our fixed manufacturing costs of approximately  of our carlsbad facility  supporting the higher volumes by increasing shift lengths and more efficient usage of existing manufacturing facilities and equipment 
we also continue to realize improved manufacturing efficiencies by driving process improvements related to larger batch sizes  which has resulted in substantially improved manufacturing yields 
december  change change sales and marketing the increase of  in sales and marketing expense for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   was primarily driven by an increase in salary expense of  associated with our commitment to increase and improve our domestic commercial organization 
the increase reflected the addition of approximately headcount four in marketing and six in sales force

clinical trial costs tend to fluctuate depending on the timing of assay approvals through the fda and requirements by the fda for additional information related to a specific assay 
december  change change other expense other expense represents non operating revenue and expenses  earnings on cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash and interest expense related to debt  capital leases and foreign exchange gain 
the change in other expense income for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   was due primarily to an increase in interest expense related to our equipment term loan and capital leases

results of operations compared to december  change change revenue product sales increased  or  to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   which was primarily driven by increased reagent revenues as well as system sales as our installed base of systems placed with customers expanded from license and other revenue increased  to  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the effects of inflation and price increases were not significant contributors to revenues for the years ended december  and december  change change cost of sales gross loss 
table of contents the increase in cost of sales for the twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  was due to higher cost of goods sold expense of  directly related to the increase in reagent sales  an inventory write down of  recorded during the year  and higher labor costs of  related to relocating our manufacturing facilities from pasadena to our carlsbad location in the inventory charge reflected the write off of several assay production lots that did not meet our quality standards and other one time expenses related to relocating our manufacturing facility from pasadena  california to the current carlsbad  california location  which was completed in june the decrease in our gross loss resulted primarily from higher sales volumes directly related to our increase in revenues and the effect of the one time charges to cost of sales 
our gross loss improved as manufacturing efficiencies were realized due to increased production volumes in compared to december  change change sales and marketing the increase in sales and marketing expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily caused by higher commission payment of  december  change change general and administrative general and administrative expense increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  due to increases in consulting  outside services and professional services  including fees of  for corporate restructuring  testing required under the sarbanes oxley act and consulting services related to business and process improvements 
these increases were partially offset by the reduction of expenses in relocation  and reorganization  at our united kingdom and pasadena  california operations to carlsbad  california 
december  change change research and development the increase in research and development expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was due to additional costs incurred in for clinical trials for our respiratory viral panel test  higher payroll costs as we continued to develop additional test menu product offerings  and patent related legal costs 
december  change change other expense income other expense income represents non operating revenue and expenses  earnings on cash  cash equivalents and investments  interest expense related to a loan payable and foreign currency gains or losses 
the decrease in other expense income for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was due primarily to recognizing the therapeutic discovery credit in there was no similar benefit for the year ended december  december  change change provision for income taxes

liquidity and capital resources to date we have funded our operations primarily from the sale of our common stock  borrowings and cash from operations 
we have incurred net losses from continuing operations each year and have not yet achieved profitability 
at december   we had  of working capital  including  in cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash 
net cash used in operations decreased  to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities decreased  to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  due to the maturity of  in short term investments 
net cash provided by financing activities increased  to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   due primarily to the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock in june from which we derived  in net proceeds

we used  to secure our term loan and letter of credit with first pactrust bankcorp and  to purchase preferred securities of our strategic partner  advanced liquid logic  inc 
table of contents cash flows provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was  for the twelve months ended december   compared to net cash provided by financing activities of  for the twelve months ended december  during the second quarter of  we issued approximately million shares of our common stock netting  after offering costs 
during the second quarter of  we issued  shares of our common stock netting  after offering costs 
during the first quarter of  we also drew down a  term loan on our then existing credit facility with square bank discussed in greater detail below 
in  we have not drawn down any loans and have repaid a substantial portion of our outstanding indebtedness 
the entire remaining balance of our outstanding indebtedness is recorded as the current portion of long term debt 
we have prepared cash flow forecasts which indicate  based on our current cash resources available  that we will have sufficient resources to fund our business for at least the next months 
we expect capital outlays and operating expenditures to increase over the next several years as we grow our customer base and revenues  and expand our research and development  commercialization and manufacturing activities 
although we believe  based on our current business plan  that we have sufficient capital to reach a positive cash flow position  the amount of additional capital we may need to raise in the future depends on many factors  including the level of revenues and the rate of our revenue growth  the level of expenses required to expand our commercial sales and marketing activities  the level of research and development investment required to maintain our xt system and develop our nexgen system and related test menu  our need to acquire or license complementary technologies  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  and  changes in regulatory policies or laws that affect our operations 
we cannot be certain that additional capital will be available when needed or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than anticipated 
if we require additional capital at a time when investment in diagnostics companies or in the marketplace in general is limited due to then prevailing market or other conditions  we may not be able to raise such funds at the time that we desire  on acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted  and these newly issued securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders 
if we obtain additional debt financing  a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness  and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations 
if we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements  we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our technologies or products  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
in march  we entered into a loan and security agreement with square bank  pursuant to which we obtained a credit facility consisting of a revolving line of credit in the amount of up to million and an equipment term loan in the amount of up to million

in february  we entered into a lease for an approximately  square foot facility in carlsbad  california  the term of which originally ran through september the facility is part of a three building office and research and development project located at la place court  carlsbad  california  and the project totals approximately  rentable square feet 
our original monthly rental payments were approximately  subject to annual increases

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to our cash and cash equivalents  all of which have maturities of less than three months  and short term investments  which have maturities of less than one year 
the goals of our investment policy are preservation of capital  fulfillment of liquidity needs and fiduciary control of cash and investments 
we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
to achieve our goals  we may in the future maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities that management believes to be of high credit quality 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
because of the short term maturities of our cash equivalents and short term investments  we do not believe that an increase in market rates would have a material negative impact on the value of our portfolio 
interest rate risk as of december   based on current interest rates and total borrowings outstanding  a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have an insignificant pre tax impact on our results of operations 
foreign currency exchange risks all of our operating facilities are located within the united states 
we are a us entity and our functional currency is the us dollar 
virtually all of our revenues are based in the united states 
in  we entered into a license agreement that requires payment in euros  and a small portion of our expenses in the first quarter of  relating to our corporate office  were transacted in british pounds 
we currently have no material operations outside of the united states  which significantly diminishes the extent of any foreign currency exchange risk we face
