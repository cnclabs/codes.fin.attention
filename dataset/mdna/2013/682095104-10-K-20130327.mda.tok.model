commitments and contingencies see note to the company s financial statements for a detailed description of commitments and contingencies 
future impact of known trends or uncertainties the company s operations are sensitive to a number of market and extrinsic factors  any one of which could materially adversely affect its results of operations in any given year construction activity the company is directly impacted by the level of single family and multi family residential housing starts and  to a lesser extent  commercial construction starts 
a few years ago  low interest rates and easy availability of credit  contributed to a high level of construction activity 
however  the past couple of years have seen deterioration in demand for residential  commercial and institutional construction 
some of the factors that influenced the decline include the crisis in the financial markets reduced the availability of financing for new construction  especially large projects foreclosures have increased the inventory of available residential housing  thereby decreasing the demand for new construction  and consumer demand and confidence has declined as a result of reduced economic activity and increased unemployment 
recently construction activity has shown upward mobility  and statistics provided by the national association of home builders suggests housing starts will increase during the coming year 
however  any significant decrease in residential construction activity may materially adversely affect the company s financial condition 
technological changes although the hvac industry has historically been impacted by technology changes in a relatively incremental manner  it cannot be discounted that radical changes such as might be suggested by fuel cell technology  burner technology and or other developing technologies which might impact the use of natural gas could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations and or financial position in the future 
weather conditions the company s flagship tracpipe and counterstrike products are used in residential and commercial heating applications 
as such  the demand for its products is impacted by weather as it affects the level of construction 
furthermore  severe climatic changes  such as those suggested by the global climate change phenomenon  could over time adversely affect the demand for fossil fuel heating products and adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial position 
purchasing practices it has been the company s policy in recent years to aggregate purchase volumes for high value commodities with fewer vendors to achieve maximum cost reductions while maintaining quality and service 
this policy has been effective in reducing costs  but has introduced additional risk which could potentially result in short term supply disruptions or cost increases from time to time in the future 
legal costs the company is subject to lawsuits mostly relating to claims of product liability 
the company has in place insurance policies to cover the defense of most of these cases  and any amounts payable with respect thereto  are typically subject to deductibles or self insured retention amounts that vary depending on the policy year 
the company is vigorously defending these cases and is confident of prevailing in one or more lawsuits in the near term 
however  continued litigation and the defense costs associated therewith  in addition to any other payments made  could affect the company results of operations  perhaps materially 
supply disruptions and commodity risks the company uses a variety of materials in the manufacture of its products  including stainless steel  polyethylene and brass for its autoflare connectors 
in connection with the purchase of commodities  principally stainless steel for manufacturing requirements  the company occasionally enters into one year purchase commitments which include a designated fixed price or range of prices 
these agreements typically require the company to accept delivery of the commodity in the quantities committed  at the agreed upon prices 
transactions required for these commodities in excess of the one year commitments are conducted at current market prices at the company s discretion 
currently  the company does not have any fixed purchase commitment contracts  but may enter into such transactions in the future 
in addition to the raw material cost strategy described above  the company enters into fixed pricing agreements for the fabrication charges necessary to convert these commodities into useable product 
it is possible that prices may decrease below the fixed prices agreed upon and therefore require the company to pay more than market price  potentially materially 
management believes at present that it has adequate sources of supply for its raw materials and components subject to the risks described above under purchasing practices and has historically not had significant difficulty in obtaining the raw materials  component parts or finished goods from its suppliers 
the company is not dependent for any commodity on a single supplier  the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on its business 
interest rate sensitivity the company currently has access to a  line of credit loc with sovereign bank  na sovereign  and as of december   has drawn  on the line 
when the company borrows against the loc  all amounts must be paid back with interest  using an interest rate range of libor plus to libor plus or prime less to prime plus  depending upon the company s then existing financial ratios 
the company may elect to use either the libor or prime rates 
as of december   the actual rate to borrow was at 
interest rates are also significant to the company as a participant in the residential construction industry  since interest rates can be a determinant factor on whether or not borrowing funds for building will be affordable to our customers 
see construction activity  above 
currently  interest rates are at historic lows  but any dramatic change to interest rates could have a detrimental effect on the business 
retention of qualified personnel the company does not operate with multiple levels of management 
it is relatively flat organizationally  which does subject the company to the risks associated with the loss of critical managers 
from time to time  there may be a shortage of skilled labor  which may make it more difficult and expensive for the company to attract and retain qualified employees 
the company is dependent upon the relatively unique talents and managerial skills of a small number of key executives 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates financial reporting release no 
 released by the securities and exchange commission  requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements include a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the company s more significant accounting policies 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to revenue recognition  inventory valuations  goodwill and intangible asset valuations  product liability costs  phantom stock and accounting for income taxes 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
our critical accounting policies and significant estimates and assumptions are described in more detail as follows revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition activities relate almost entirely to the manufacture and sale of flexible metal hose and pipe 
under gaap  revenues are considered to have been earned when the company has substantially accomplished what it must do to be entitled to the benefits represented by the revenues 
the following criteria represent preconditions to the recognition of revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement for the sale of product or services must exist 
delivery has occurred or services rendered 
the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable 
collection is reasonably assured 
the company generally recognizes revenue upon shipment in accordance with the above principles 
gross sales are reduced for all consideration paid to customers for which no identifiable benefit is received by the company 
this includes promotional incentives  which includes various programs including year end rebates and discounts 
the amounts of certain incentives are known with reasonable certainty at the time of sale  while others are projected based upon the most reliable information available at the reporting date 
commissions  for which the company receives an identifiable benefit  are accounted for as a selling expense 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
the estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on specific analysis of accounts in the receivable portfolio and historical write off experience 
while management believes the allowance to be adequate  if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost of inventories are determined by the first in  first out fifo method 
the company generally considers inventory quantities beyond two years usage  measured on a historical usage basis  to be excess inventory and reduces the gross carrying value of inventory accordingly 
goodwill in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb asc topic  with respect to goodwill  the company performs annual impairment tests using the market capitalization on the last day of the year to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and then compares that value to the carrying value 
as of december  and december   the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value  and therefore the company concluded that goodwill was not impaired 
product liability reserves product liability reserves represent the unpaid amounts under the company s insurance policies with respect to known claims 
the company uses the most current available data to estimate claims 
as explained more fully under contingencies  for various product liability claims covered under the company s general liability insurance policies  the company must pay certain defense costs within its deductible or self insured retention limits  ranging primarily from  to  per claim  depending on the terms of the policy in the applicable policy year  up to an aggregate amount 
the company is vigorously defending against all known claims 
phantom stock the company uses the black scholes option pricing model as its method for determining fair value of the units 
the company uses the straight line method of attributing the value of the stock based compensation expense relating to the units 
the compensation expense including adjustment of the liability to its fair value from the units is recognized over the requisite service period of each grant or award 
the fasb asc topic stock compensation requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates in order to derive the company s best estimate of awards ultimately to vest 
forfeitures represent only the unvested portion of a surrendered unit and are typically estimated based on historical experience 
based on an analysis of the company s historical data  which has limited experience related to any stock based plan forfeitures  the company applied a forfeiture rate to plan units outstanding in determining its plan unit compensation expense for december  accounting for income taxes the company accounts for federal tax liabilities in accordance with asc topic  income taxes 
under this method the company recorded tax expense  related deferred taxes and tax benefits  and uncertainties in tax positions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before the company is able to realize the benefit  or that future deductibility is uncertain 
no valuation allowance was deemed necessary at december  or also  in accordance with fasb asc topic  the company had a reserve for uncertainties in tax positions of  at december   and  at december  these reserves are reviewed each quarter 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company s primary cash needs have been related to working capital items including inventory purchases  which the company has largely funded through cash generated from operations 
as of december   the company had a cash balance of  additionally  the company has a  line of credit available with sovereign bank  as discussed in detail in note  which had borrowings of  outstanding upon it at the end of at december   the company had cash of  and therefore had experienced a decrease in cash of  during operating activities cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities  such as those included in working capital 
for the twelve months of  the company s cash from operating activities increased  over the comparable period in the prior year  of which a portion was due to cash generated from standard operations over and above a significant factor contributing to the increase was however related to the insurance legal recovery received during the first quarter of  which enhanced cash from operations by approximately  after considering the deduction for auxiliary costs such as taxes 
additionally  the company had experienced a  increase in its marketing related promotional incentive liabilities when comparing december  to while the extra promotional incentives reduced income in  the associated cash will not be paid until the first quarter of further  in the company paid approximately  more for insurance costs than in  largely connected to long term coverage 
the overall increase discussed above was reflected even though the company paid incentive compensation during december which would normally have been paid during the first quarter of the new year 
this was done preemptively in light of the looming governmental tax increases 
as a general trend  the company tends to deplete cash during the first four months of the year  as significant payments are typically made for accrued promotional incentives  incentive compensation  and taxes 
cash has then historically shown a tendency to be restored and accumulated during the latter portion of the year 
in  the cash outlay for operating items may be larger than usual  as it is known that the company will pay approximately  in regards to the settlement agreement reached by the company s english subsidiary  omega flex limited during march of  as described in detail in note  subsequent events 
investing activities cash used in investing activities for the twelve months of and was  and  respectively  all related to capital expenditures for both years 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend upon many factors including our rate of revenue growth  the timing and extent of any expansion efforts  and the potential for investments in  or the acquisition of any complementary products  businesses or supplementary facilities for additional capacity 
regarding any known material commitments for capital expenditures  the company does anticipate an increase in capital spending in related to the expansion of our current manufacturing capabilities  as well as space  as the company has opened another manufacturing facility located largely adjacent to the existing main manufacturing facility in exton  pa 
total capital spending for the coming year could approach  financing activities during  the company borrowed  from its line of credit with sovereign  as described in note additionally  the company paid a per share cash dividend to shareholders during december of totaling  as described fully in note there were no financing activities during if excess cash is available at the end of the year  and if no sensible investment opportunity exists  the company may  and has shown a willingness in the past  to declare and pay a dividend to the shareholders 
recent accounting pronouncements accounting standards update asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
in september  the fasb issued guidance to amend and simplify the rules related to testing goodwill for impairment 
the revised guidance allows an entity to make an initial qualitative evaluation  based on the entity s events and circumstances  to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
the results of this qualitative assessment determine whether it is necessary to perform the currently required two step impairment test 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  management evaluated the impact on the consolidated financial statements as a result of adopting this guidance  and we believe it had no impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flow 
asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
in june  the fasb issued new accounting guidance related to the presentation of comprehensive income that eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in shareholders equity 
the amendments require that all non owner changes in shareholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the amendments do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
the company adopted this guidance in the quarter ended march  the adoption of this guidance did not have any impact on the company financial position  results of operations or cash flows and only impacted the presentation of other comprehensive income in the financial statements 
asu  balance sheet topic disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities this asu requires entities to disclose both gross information and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the balance sheet  and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement 
the requirements are effective for annual periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods 
management believes asu will have no impact on the company s financial conditions  results of operations and cash flows for the foreseeable future 
asu  comprehensive income topic deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
 issued in december amends asu to reflect only those changes in update that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments 
the amendments are being made to allow fasb time to re deliberate whether to present on the face of the financial statements the effects of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income for all periods presented 
while fasb is considering the operational concerns about the presentation requirements for reclassification adjustments and the needs of financial statement users for additional information about reclassification adjustments  entities should continue to report reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income consistent with the presentation requirements in effect before update nonpublic entities should begin applying these requirements for fiscal years ending after december  adoption of asu had no material impact on the financial statements 
off balance sheet obligations or arrangements the company has off balance sheet obligations or arrangements at december  that relate to purchase commitments for the following year  and also operating lease obligations  which in total equal  the total amount of these obligations at december  was  item a quantitatative and qualitative disclosures about market risks the company does not engage in the purchase or trading of market risk sensitive instruments 
the company does not presently have any positions with respect to hedge transactions such as forward contracts relating to currency fluctuations 
no market risk sensitive instruments are held for speculative or trading purposes
