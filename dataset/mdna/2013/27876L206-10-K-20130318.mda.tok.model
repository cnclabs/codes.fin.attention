summary we are a medical device company with expertise in advanced skin permeation technology 
we are developing our symphony cgm system as a non invasive  wireless continuous glucose monitoring system for use in hospital critical care units and for people with diabetes 
the prelude skinprep system  a component of our symphony cgm system  allows for enhanced skin permeation that will enable extraction of analytes such as glucose 
prelude s platform skin preparation technology also allows for needle free  transdermal drug delivery 
additional applications for needle free analyte extraction and topical and systemic drug delivery are planned 
research and development our research and development expenses include employee salaries and benefits  external product design  development  engineering and manufacturing services  as well as other contract service providers and an allocation of our facilities costs 
our product development efforts are principally concentrated on prelude and symphony 
while our medical device product development and clinical programs have made progress  limitations on financial resources in prior years have prevented us from advancing these programs in accordance with original timelines 
with the recent capital raises completed over the last three years  we have increased our product and clinical development efforts  manufacturing activities and regulatory planning for symphony and prelude 
critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
as of december   we had cash of approximately  a working capital deficiency of approximately  and an accumulated deficit of approximately  through december   we have not been able to generate sufficient revenues from our operations to cover our costs and operating expenses 
although we have been able to raise capital through a series of common stock public offerings in order to fund our operations  it is not known whether we will be able to continue this practice  or be able to obtain other types of financing to meet our future cash operating expenses 
subsequent to december   we received net proceeds from a common stock public offering of approximately  of which  was used to fully repay the notes we issued to montaur under the credit facility see our consolidated financial statements  note 
additional financing is necessary to fund operations in and beyond 
we are currently pursuing various financing options  and such financing is expected to be completed during  however  no assurances can be given as to the success of these plans 
the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties 

table of contents our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments for all assets and liabilities  including those related to stock based compensation expense  intangible assets  other long lived assets  and the fair value of stock purchase warrants classified as derivative liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  current economic and industry conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report on form k 
we believe the critical accounting policies discussed below are those most important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
we believe that full consideration has been given to all relevant circumstances that we may be subject to  and the consolidated financial statements accurately reflect our best estimate of the results of operations  financial position and cash flows for the periods presented 
intangible assets and other long lived assets we record intangible assets at acquisition date fair value 
in connection with our acquisition of durham pharmaceuticals ltd  a north carolina corporation doing business as echo therapeutics  inc the eti acquisition  in september  intangible assets related to contractual arrangements were amortized over the estimated useful life of years which ended in intangible assets related to technology are expected to be amortized on a straight line basis over the period ending when the underlying patents expire and will commence upon revenue generation 
accounting for impairment and disposal of long lived assets we review intangible assets subject to amortization annually to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life 
conditions that would indicate impairment and trigger an impairment assessment include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset  or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
if the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows  we write down the carrying value of the intangible asset to its fair value in the period identified 
for purposes of this analysis  we estimate our cash flows using a projection period not exceeding ten years  market size based on estimated market share  estimated costs to complete product development  operating expenses and a blended tax rate 
generally  cash flow forecasts for purposes of impairment analysis are prepared on a consistent basis and methodology as those used to initially estimate the intangible asset s fair value 
if the carrying value of assets is determined not to be recoverable  we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the assets 
our estimate of fair value is based on the best information available to us  in the absence of quoted market prices 
we generally calculate fair value as the present value of estimated future cash flows that we expect to generate from the asset using the income approach 
significant estimates included in the discounted cash flow analysis as consistent with those described above are used except that we introduce a risk adjusted discount rate 
the risk adjusted discount rate is estimated using a weighted average cost of capital analysis 
if the estimate of an intangible asset s remaining useful life is changed  we amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life 
for other long lived assets  we evaluate quarterly whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired 

table of contents share based payments we record share based payments at fair value 
the grant date fair value of awards to employees and directors  net of expected forfeitures  is recognized as expense in the statement of operations over the requisite service period 
the fair value of options is calculated using the black scholes option pricing model 
this option valuation model requires input of assumptions including  among others  the volatility of our stock price  the expected life of the option and the risk free interest rate 
we estimate the volatility of our stock price using historical prices 
we estimate the expected life of our option using the average of the vesting period and the contractual term of the option 
the estimated forfeiture rate is based on historical forfeiture information as well as subsequent events occurring prior to the issuance of the financial statements 
because our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  the existing model may not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of fair value of our stock options 
derivative instruments we generally do not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow or market risks  however  certain warrants to purchase common stock that do not meet the requirements for classification as equity are classified as liabilities 
in such instances  net cash settlement is assumed for financial reporting purposes  even when the terms of the underlying contracts do not provide for a net cash settlement 
such financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value charged credited to operations in each reporting period 
if these instruments subsequently meet the requirements for classification as equity  we reclassify the fair value to equity 
revenue recognition to date  we have generated revenue primarily from licensing agreements  including upfront  nonrefundable license fees  and from amounts reimbursed by licensees for third party engineering services for product development 
we recognize revenue when the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and risk of loss has passed  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
in addition  when evaluating multiple element arrangements  we consider whether the components of the arrangement represent separate units of accounting 
multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if specified criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration received is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
otherwise  the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to combined elements as a single unit of accounting 
we typically receive upfront  nonrefundable payments for the licensing of our intellectual property upon the signing of a license agreement 
we believe that these payments generally are not separable from the payments we receive for providing research and development services because the license does not have stand alone value from the research and development services we provide under these agreements 
accordingly  we account for these elements as one unit of accounting and recognize upfront  nonrefundable payments as revenue on a straight line basis over its contractual or estimated performance period 
revenue from the reimbursement of research and development efforts is recognized as the services are performed based on proportional performance adjusted from time to time for any delays or acceleration in the development of the product 
we estimate the performance period based on the contractual requirements of its collaboration agreements 
at each reporting period  we evaluate whether events warrant a change in the estimated performance period 
other revenue includes amounts earned and billed under the license and collaboration agreements for reimbursement for research and development costs for contract engineering services 
for the services rendered  principally third party contract engineering services  the revenue recognized approximates the costs associated with the services 

table of contents recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  which gives companies the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
if a company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of such an asset exceeds its carrying amount  it would not need to calculate the fair value of the asset in that year 
however  if a company concludes otherwise  it must calculate the fair value of the asset  compare that value with its carrying amount and record an impairment charge  if any 
the amendments in the asu are effective for annual and interim indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   which is fiscal for the company 
early adoption is permitted 
the company is currently assessing its adoption plans 
in december  the fasb issued asu  disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities topic  that provides amendments for disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 
the amendments require an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
entities are required to disclose both gross information and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement 
this scope would include derivatives  sale and repurchase agreements and reverse sale and repurchase agreements  and securities borrowing and securities lending arrangements 
the amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods 
disclosures required by the amendments should be provided retrospectively for all comparative periods presented 
for the company  the amendment is effective for fiscal year the company is currently evaluating the impact these amendments may have on its disclosures 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and licensing revenue we signed two licensing agreements during fiscal year  each with a minimum term of ten years  that required non refundable license payments by the licensees

we have demonstrated the ability to aggressively manage our spending in accordance with our available capital and increase our operating efficiencies while advancing our medical device product development and clinical programs 
during the year ended december   we managed our medical device product development  clinical and operating costs while pursuing necessary funding 
in order to advance our product and clinical development programs  establish contract manufacturing and support our licensee for the manufacture of prelude  pursue fda approval for symphony and support our operating activities  we expect our monthly operating costs associated with salaries and benefits  regulatory and public company consulting  contract engineering and manufacturing  legal and other working capital costs to increase 
in the past  we have relied primarily on raising capital or issuing debt in order to meet our operating budget and to achieve our business objectives  and we plan to continue that practice in the future 
although we have been successful in the past with raising sufficient capital to conduct our operations  we will continue to vigorously pursue additional financing as necessary to meet our business objectives  however  there can be no guarantee that additional capital will be available in sufficient amounts on terms favorable to us  if at all 

table of contents the recent poor economic conditions leading up to  including the tightening of available funding in the financial markets  had a significant impact on the extent of advancement on our product development and clinical programs in accordance with our original projected level of operations 
although we have successfully raised sufficient capital to conduct our operations  we believe that uncertainties in the financial markets may occur in the future  resulting in fundraising challenges for emerging medical device and pharmaceutical companies 
our future product and clinical development programs and regulatory activities may be dependent on available additional funding from investors 
without sufficient funding for our programs  our plan to obtain regulatory approval for symphony and durhalieve may be delayed 
our ability to fund our future operating requirements will depend on many factors  including the following our ability to obtain funding from third parties  including any future collaborative partners  on reasonable terms  our progress on research and development programs  the time and costs required to gain regulatory approvals  the costs of manufacturing  marketing and distributing our products  if successfully developed and approved  the costs of filing  prosecuting and enforcing patents  patent applications  patent claims and trademarks  the status of competing products  and the market acceptance and third party reimbursement of our products  if successfully developed and approved 
we have generated limited revenue and have had operating losses since inception  including a net loss of approximately  for the year ended december  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately  we have no current sources of material ongoing revenue  other than the recognition of revenue from upfront license fees and potential future milestone payments and royalties under our current license and collaboration agreements 
our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with our research and development activities and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
we also expect to have negative cash flows for the foreseeable future as we fund our operating losses and capital expenditures 
this will result in decreases in our working capital  total assets and stockholders equity  which may not be offset by future funding 
continued operating losses would impair our ability to continue operations 
we have operating and liquidity concerns due to our significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations 
our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon generating sufficient cash flow to conduct operations and utilizing our credit facility or obtaining additional financing 
our current plan will have us almost double our research and development  manufacturing  and sales and marketing expenses in related to our symphony cgm system 
historically  we have had difficulty in meeting our cash requirements 
there can be no assurances that we will obtain the necessary funding  reduce the level of historical losses and achieve successful commercialization of any of our drug product candidates 
if we cannot obtain additional funding  we may be required to revise our operating plans  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to change our operating plan successfully 
facilities  property and equipment we conduct our operations primarily in leased facilities located in philadelphia  pennsylvania and franklin  massachusetts and have executed leases through may  and october   respectively  for each facility 
our property and equipment includes laboratory equipment  office furniture  computer equipment and leasehold improvements

off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements  including unrecorded derivative instruments that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
we have a large number of warrants and stock options outstanding but we do not expect to receive sufficient proceeds from the exercise of these instruments unless and until the trading price of our common stock is significantly greater than the applicable exercise prices of the options and warrants for a sustained period of time 
effect of inflation and changes in prices management does not believe that inflation and changes in prices will have a material effect on our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of change in fair value of a financial instrument due to changes in interest rates  equity prices  creditworthiness  financing  exchange rates or other factors 
our primary market risk exposure relates to changes in interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents 
we place our investments in primarily money market funds  which we believe are subject to limited interest rate and credit risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
at december   we held million in cash and cash equivalents and  due to the short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe that a change in average interest rates would have a significant impact on our interest income 
our outstanding debt has a fixed interest rate and  therefore  we have no exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our debt 
we have operated primarily in the us  although we do  on occasion  conduct some business activities with vendors outside the us while most of our expenses are paid in us dollars  we make payments from time to time in the vendor s local foreign currency 
if the average exchange rates used on those payments undergo a change of  we do not believe that it would have a significant impact on our results of operations or cash flows
