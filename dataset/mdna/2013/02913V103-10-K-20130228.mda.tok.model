part i item business company overview american public education  inc is a provider of exclusively online postsecondary education with an emphasis on serving the needs of the military and public service communities 
we operate through two universities american military university  or amu  and american public university  or apu 
together  amu and apu constitute the american public university system  or apus 
our universities share a common faculty and curriculum  which includes degree programs and certificate programs in disciplines related to national security  military studies  intelligence  homeland security  criminal justice  technology  business administration  education  nursing  and liberal arts 
we currently serve approximately  students living in all states and the district of columbia in the united states  as well as in various international locations 
our university system is regionally accredited 
from to  our total revenue increased from million to million  which represents a compound annual growth rate of 
our net registrations increased and in and  respectively  over the prior periods 
we believe our growth is attributable to i high student satisfaction and referral rates  ii regional accreditation  iii increasing acceptance of distance learning within our targeted markets  and iv the variety and affordability of our programs 
as our revenue base grows  we expect our growth rate percentages to continue to decline 
however  we expect actual dollar revenue growth to increase 
net income improved to million in from million in approximately of our students serve in the united states military on active duty 
the remainder of our students are generally civilians  many with careers in public service  such as federal  national  and local law enforcement personnel or other first responders  or they are civilians who are military affiliated professionals  such as veterans  reservists  or national guard members 
our programs are generally designed to prepare individuals for productive contributions to their professions and society  as well as to potentially advance their current professions or prepare for their next career 
our online method of instruction is well suited to our students  many of whom serve in positions requiring extended and irregular schedules  are on call for rapid response missions  participate in extended deployments and exercises  travel or relocate frequently  and have limited financial resources 
our satisfied students have been a significant source of referrals for us  which we believe has led to lower marketing costs among certain of our student populations 
as of december   we had approximately full time and over  adjunct faculty 
nearly all of our faculty members have advanced degrees and many of them have leadership experience in their fields 
our adjunct faculty also includes professors who teach at leading national and state universities 
we believe quality faculty members are attracted to us because of the high percentage of military and public service professionals in our student body who can immediately apply lessons learned in our classroom to their daily work 
in addition  our faculty members are attracted to the flexible nature of teaching online and the numerous support services we provide to them 
our faculty is organized into several departments under the leadership of a provost who reports to our president and is under the supervision of a nine member board of trustees 
we have invested significant capital and resources in developing proprietary information systems and processes to support what we refer to as partnership at a distance  or pad 
pad is the patented approach to how we interact with our students 
at its center is a dynamic information system enabling us to recognize that every student is unique and to provide individualized support at appropriate times from pre enrollment through and beyond graduation  including student advising  administrative support  and community networking 
by avoiding a one size fits all approach  the system provides the flexibility to maintain a highly engaged partnership with our learners based on their preferences 
pad has allowed us to scale and improve the quality of our academic offerings and student support 
our systems and processes also help us measure and manage the activities of our faculty  student support personnel  and prospective and active students  allowing us to continuously improve our academic quality  student support services  and marketing efficiency 
we believe these proprietary systems and processes will support a much larger institution and provide us important competitive and cost advantages 
however  we also believe that we need to continue to invest in our systems and new technologies in order to stay competitive and relevant to adult learners 
history we were founded as american military university in and began offering courses in january our founder  a retired marine officer  established american military university as a distance learning graduate level institution  specializing in a military studies curriculum for military officers seeking an advanced degree relevant to their profession 
following initial national accreditation by the accrediting commission of the distance education and training council  or detc  in  american military university began offering undergraduate programs primarily directed to members of the armed forces in january american military university gradually broadened its military studies curriculum over the next three years to include defense management  civil war studies  intelligence  and unconventional warfare  and later expanded into military related disciplines  such as criminal justice  emergency management  national security  and homeland security 
over time  american military university diversified its educational offerings into the liberal arts in response to demand by military students for post military career preparation 
with its expanded program offerings  american military university began to attract the greater public service community  primarily police  fire  emergency management personnel  and national security professionals 
in  we reorganized the operations of american military university into our current university system and began operating through two universities  amu and apu 
the purpose of the reorganization was  in part  to establish an institution brand  apu  that would appeal to non military markets  including public service professionals such as teachers 
our university system achieved regional accreditation in may with the higher learning commission of the north central association of colleges and schools higher learning commission 
in july  the higher learning commission reaffirmed accreditation of apus for online courses and programs without any other stipulations on its affiliation status 
our next comprehensive evaluation is scheduled for the academic year  with an interim progress report on development of university system wide coordination and improvement of graduate studies due in july in  we received approval from the higher learning commission to offer a new degree program in electrical engineering 
since the founding of american military university  we have gradually transitioned from a military focus to a broader focus on the military  public services  and civilian communities 
we expect the percentage of our students that are not eligible for tuition assistance programs of the department of defense  or dod  to continue to increase  particularly as a result of our eligibility to participate in title iv programs 
furthermore  because our students who use the dod tuition assistance programs generally take fewer courses at one time than our other students  they represent a smaller percentage of our net enrollment than they do of our total student body 
in  we announced plans that may expand our focus to include international students through a new investment in  and relationship with  new horizons worldwide  inc  a global independent it training company 
market overview within the postsecondary education market  we believe that there is significant opportunity for growth in online programs 
we believe that increasing requirements for workers to have job mobility and critical skills  combined with the growing acceptance of online learning from employers and the flexibility associated with online learning  should attract more students  both traditional and adult  to distance learning 
there are more than million active and reserve military professionals in the united states armed forces 
historically  approximately  new service members are enlisted or commissioned to replace retiring and separating members each year 
however  this number is likely to decrease if  as proposed  the military downsizes forces incrementally 
we believe that the unpredictable and demanding work schedules of military personnel and their geographic distribution make online learning and asynchronous teaching particularly attractive to them 
military leaders and policies promote voluntary education programs as a means for service members to gain the knowledge and skills that will improve their military performance as well as prepare them for a career following their military service 
academic achievement can also result in increased rank and pay for service members 
the united states armed forces recognize academic achievement through awarding promotion points for academic credits  specifying education level eligibility requirements for assignments  promotions  and service schools  and entering remarks on performance appraisals 
active duty and reserve component military personnel are eligible for tuition assistance through the dod s uniform tuition assistance program 
dod policy allows for payment of of a military student s tuition costs  up to per semester credit hour and a maximum benefit of  per fiscal year 
our undergraduate tuition per course is designed so that the tuition assistance paid by the service branches covers the cost of our courses for service members up to the annual maximum benefit 
eligible military students may also use their benefits under the montgomery gi bill or the post veterans educational assistance act of  or the post gi bill  as amended  to pay for tuition costs above the dod limits through the gi bills top up feature  which is administered by the us department of veterans affairs 
most military veterans are eligible to use their gi bill entitlements to continue their education after retirement or separation 
the dod announced in october that  while it will maintain the current levels of tuition assistance in the near term  it plans to consider changes as part of a holistic review of the military compensation package 
see regulation of our business nature of federal  state and private financial support for postsecondary education below for more information on tuition assistance 
over the last several years  a number of our competitors have expanded their outreach and marketing efforts to the active duty and reserve component military and veteran population 
we believe this is related to a growing desire among for profit institutions to seek new sources of revenue outside of title iv programs  which is driven by concerns with a compliance obligation under the higher education opportunity act  commonly referred to as the rule  which prohibits proprietary institutions from deriving from title iv funds  on a cash accounting basis except for certain institutional loans for any fiscal year  more than of its revenues as computed for rule purposes 
we believe that for profit schools seek to attract military students in order to comply with the rule  as dod tuition assistance and veterans education benefits currently do not count towards the limit 
see regulation of our business regulation of title iv financial aid programs the rule below for more information on the rule  including recent proposals to count dod tuition assistance and veterans education benefits toward the limit 
our results in any quarter may not indicate the results we may achieve in any subsequent quarter or full year 
our revenues and operating results normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal or other variations in our enrollments 
student population varies as a result of new enrollments  graduations  student attrition  the success of our marketing programs and other reasons that we cannot always anticipate 
while our number of enrolled students has grown in each sequential quarter over the past three years  the number of enrolled students has been proportionally greatest in the fourth quarter of each respective year 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results to continue as a result of seasonal enrollment patterns 
we believe that civilian students  including those in national security  homeland security  and public safety professions  represent a large market for online education 
as with their military counterparts  civilian working adult students have unique program requirements as well as unpredictable and demanding work schedules that often prevent them from attending traditional universities 
in addition  we believe academic programs in fields such as nursing  education and liberal arts are also attractive programs to certain prospective students 
we also believe that international students represent a large and growing market for quality online education  particularly at institutions with affordable tuition levels 
the growing acceptance of online education has led to an increasing number of traditional universities offering online programs 
while this increase represents growing competition for our institution  we also believe that it represents the opportunity to partner with and or provide education hosting and other student services to universities  other institutions of higher learning  and to corporations 
competitive strengths we believe that we have the following competitive strengths online higher education and a diverse array of programs we have designed our courses and programs specifically for online delivery  and we recruit and train faculty exclusively for online instruction 
because our students are located around the globe  we focus our instruction on asynchronous  interactive instruction that provides students the flexibility to study and interact during the hours of the day or days of the week that suit their terms and schedules 
apus offers degree programs in fields ranging from homeland security  space studies  and emergency and disaster management to liberal arts and education 
commitment to academic excellence our academic programs are overseen by our board of trustees  which counts as members two former college presidents  active accreditation peer evaluators  a former commandant of the marine corps  and a former department of the army inspector general 
we are committed to continuously improving our academic programs and services  as evidenced by the level of attention and resources that we apply to instruction and educational support 
affordable tuition our combined tuition  fees  and books are less for undergraduate and graduate students than the average in state cost at a public university 
tuition was established at a competitive rate whereby dod tuition assistance programs fully cover the cost of undergraduate course tuition and over of the cost of graduate course tuition 
we have not increased our undergraduate tuition rate of per credit hour since effective student support systems and data driven decision making through pad  students may access our admission  orientation  course registrations  tuition payments  book requests  grades  transcripts  degree progress  and various other services online we also have created management tools based on the data from pad that help us to improve continuously our academic quality  student support services  and marketing efficiency 
growth strategies we believe our growth in student enrollment and revenue has consistently been driven by high student satisfaction and referral rates  and by increasing acceptance of distance learning within our targeted markets 
between and  we grew our revenue from million to million 
our revenues increased by to million for the year ended december  as our revenue base grows  we expect our growth rate percentages to continue to decline 
to expand our business  we plan to employ the following strategies continue serving the military market we have focused on the needs of the military community since our founding 
the combination of our online model  focused curriculum  and outreach to the military has enabled us to gain market share from more established schools  many of which are traditional brick and mortar schools that have served this market for longer periods 
broaden our acceptance in the public service and civilian markets we design our curriculum to be relevant to federal  state  and local law enforcement  first responders  and other public service professionals 
we believe that the affordability  quality  and diversity of our academic program offerings  including our liberal arts degrees  are attractive options for civilian students 
add new degree programs over the long term  we plan to expand our degree offerings to meet our students needs and marketplace demands with a focus on new programs in fields exhibiting higher than average growth 
in addition  we are currently preparing our institution academically and culturally to potentially offer doctoral programs within the next few years 
pursue and expand strategic partnerships we believe that articulation agreements and partnerships with institutions of higher learning  corporations  professional associations  and other organizations are important to our enrollment growth and to expanding access to higher education 
provide education hosting and support services we have recently begun to offer hosting and support services to traditional universities and other institutions of higher learning to support online offerings 
we believe the growth of online programs at traditional universities  combined with the attractiveness of our distance learning platform  represents an attractive business opportunity to provide such services to smaller universities as a low cost  high quality provider of online education 
explore international opportunities we are developing partnerships and other initiatives aimed at expanding international access to our affordable online programs that will further increase the diversity of our student population  enhance the learning environment  and diversify our tuition funding sources 
in addition  we plan to pursue other relationships  partnerships  and business opportunities that may expand our international reach  including the development of new international relationships  corporate training programs  and non degree certifications 
to assist us in achieving elements of our growth strategy or to further develop our business capabilities  we will continue to consider and may pursue strategic investments and acquisitions 
for example  on september   we made a million or approximately investment in preferred stock of nwhw holdings  inc  which in turn acquired new horizons worldwide  inc  or new horizons 
in connection with this investment in nwhw holdings  inc  we also extended million in credit to new horizons in exchange for a subordinated note 
new horizons is a global it training company operating over locations around the world through franchise arrangements in states and countries 
in connection with the investment  we are entitled to certain rights  including right to representation on the board of directors of nwhw holdings 
future strategic investments or acquisitions could include investments in  partnerships or joint ventures with  or the acquisition of other schools  service providers or education technology related companies  among other types of entities 
accreditation american public university system is accredited by the higher learning commission and is a member of the north central association of colleges and schools www 
ncahlc 
org 
the higher learning commission accredits degree granting institutions located in a state region  including west virginia  and is recognized by the us department of education 
the higher learning commission initially granted us candidacy status in february we received accreditation from the higher learning commission in may in july  the higher learning commission reaffirmed accreditation of apus for online courses and programs without any other stipulations on its affiliation status 
our next comprehensive evaluation is scheduled for the academic year  with an interim progress report on development of university system wide coordination and improvement of graduate studies due in july we were also accredited by the accrediting commission of the distance education and training council  or detc  until april   when we voluntarily withdrew our accreditation 
we have always identified the higher learning commission as our primary accreditor for title iv purposes 
therefore  our withdrawal of detc accreditation did not affect our title iv participation 
in addition to our university wide accreditation with the higher learning commission  our associate of arts in business administration  bachelor of business administration  bachelor of arts in marketing  and master of business administration programs have a specialized accreditation from the accreditation council for business schools and programs and our bachelor of science in nursing has specialized accreditation from the commission on collegiate nursing education 
in addition  we have obtained professional recognition for our emergency and disaster management program from the foundation for higher education accreditation  for our management program from the society of human resources  for our sports and health sciences program from the american sport education program  and for our child and family development program from the national council on family relations 
maintaining our specialized accreditations and professional recognitions and obtaining other specialized accreditations and professional recognitions will continue to become a more important part of our marketing and outreach efforts to prospective students 
curriculum and scheduling we offer degree and certificate programs 
academic terms begin on the first monday of each month  with over  classes in over  unique courses in either eight or sixteen week formats 
semesters and academic years are established to manage requirements for participation in title iv programs and to assist students who are utilizing title iv programs in meeting eligibility requirements 
programs number master of arts master of business administration master of education master of public administration master of public health master of science bachelor of arts bachelor of business administration bachelor of science associate of arts associate of science certificates graduate undergraduate total at the graduate level  we offer degree programs in the following disciplines masters of arts in criminal justice emergency management and disaster management history homeland security humanities intelligence studies international relations and conflict resolution legal studies management military history military studies national security studies political science psychology reverse logistics management security management transportation management and logistics master of business administration master of education in administration and supervision guidance counseling teaching master of public administration master of public health master of science in accounting environmental policy and management information technology space studies sports and health sciences sports management at the undergraduate level  we offer degree programs in the following disciplines bachelor of arts in child and family development criminal justice emergency and disaster management english general studies history homeland security hospitality management intelligence studies international relations management marketing middle eastern studies military history military management and program acquisition philosophy political science psychology religion retail management reverse logistics management security management sociology transportation and logistics management bachelor of business administration bachelor of science in accounting criminal justice environmental studies fire science management information system security information technology information technology management legal studies nursing public health space studies sports and health sciences associate of arts in business administration communication counter terrorism studies criminal justice early childhood care and education general studies history hospitality management military history real estate studies retail management weapons of mass destruction preparedness associate of science in accounting computer applications database application development explosive ordnance disposal fire science paralegal studies public health web publishing our certificate programs generally consist of a minimum of semester hours of required courses focusing on a particular component of the broader degree program 
students may earn discrete certificates or earn certificates in combination with work toward a degree program 
lead generation and student recruitment we have traditionally focused on a relationship based marketing strategy striving to build long term  mutually beneficial relationships with organizations and individuals in the military and public service communities 
beginning in late  we began to expand our efforts to attract civilian students by creating greater awareness of our apu brand 
we believe that people in the military and public service communities tend to be tightly knit affinity groups  which greatly facilitates personal referrals from influential members as well as from current students and alumni to prospective students 
using this approach has enabled us to achieve student acquisition costs that we believe are substantially less than the industry average 
we have also supplemented our relationship based marketing with multi faceted interactive marketing campaigns organic search  pay per click and banner advertising  and participation in online social communities  among other methods to help build brand awareness and drive inquiries  and beginning in and through  we began utilizing a greater percentage of traditional media advertising 
our experience is that the students that these new forms of marketing attract do not perform as well as the students that our relationship based strategy has historically attracted 
as we continue to grow  we will need to continue to focus on and improve the utilization of marketing channels that will support our growth by attracting a greater proportion of students that we believe will be successful in the long term 
the changes to our marketing approach related to our expansion in non military markets are the primary drivers of the increases in our student acquisition costs that we have experienced 
as we continue to grow in size and diversity  our student acquisition costs may continue to increase and we may have a harder time attracting students that perform well over the long term 
admissions our universities welcome qualified individuals to apply for admission at any time through an online application process 
the current qualifications for most of our undergraduate programs are a high school diploma or general education development certificate 
graduate applicants must hold a baccalaureate degree from an accredited us institution or an equivalent foreign institution 
prospective students apply directly online 
upon completing the online application and orientation  students are issued a student id number and password and are provided information for submitting the necessary documentation to finalize their admission and apply for evaluation of credits that they would like to transfer 
students are also informed how to register for their initial course s  arrange for tuition payment and navigate the online student environment 
prospective students who have questions during the admissions process may obtain assistance through our online resources and can contact the admissions department through our online resources or by telephone 
tuition  books and fees we believe that our ability to provide affordable programs is one of our competitive strengths 
we have maintained our undergraduate tuition costs to be lower than public  in state rates on average and in line with dod tuition ceilings 
undergraduate tuition is per semester credit hour  or per three credit course 
since  we have not raised undergraduate tuition rates per semester credit hour 
if we were to implement a tuition increase  or if the dod were to lower the amount of tuition assistance per semester credit hour  military students eligible for the us department of veterans affairs gi bill may apply that entitlement to cover the difference through the top up feature 
a full semester hour undergraduate degree may be earned for  plus applicable fees 
eligible undergraduate students receive their textbooks at no cost to them through our book grant program  which represents a potential average student savings over the course of a degree of approximately  when compared to four year colleges according to the college board study  annual trends in college pricing report from many students transfer in a significant amount of prior credit earned  which also reduces the cost and time of earning their degrees 
graduate tuition is currently per semester hour  or per three semester credit hour course 
for military students  the service branch pays of the tuition costs per course  and students have the option of paying the remainder out of pocket or applying their gi bill entitlements to cover the cost above at these tuition rates  students may earn a graduate degree for less than  in tuition costs for most of our programs 
we do not charge an admission fee  nor do we charge fees for services such as registration  course drops  and similar events that trigger fees at many other institutions 
in addition  as a fully online institution of higher learning  there are no resident fees  such as for parking  food service  student union  and recreation 
while we charge a fee for transfer credit evaluation for non active duty military students and civilian students  unlike transfer credit fees at many institutions  the fee is a one time  flat fee that does not increase as more credits are transferred 
a technology fee of per course was also implemented for course registrations beginning after september  however  apus provides a grant to cover the fee for active duty military  national guard and reserve personnel  and for anyone using dod tuition assistance benefits 
the grant also covers the fee for students using veterans education benefits 
in addition to military and veterans benefits  we offer a variety of federal and non federal aid programs to assist students with their education costs 
net course registrations by students using federal student aid programs under title iv constituted of our net registrations in  and we expect that the ability to participate in these programs is important to our growth 
the following aid sources are available from military  federal  state  agency  and local organizations to help students meet their education goals military and veterans student aid training funds tuition assistance veterans administration benefits montgomery gi bill or post gi bill other federal student aid  including title iv programs federal pell grant federal subsidized stafford loan federal unsubsidized stafford loan federal plus loan federal graduate plus loan teacher education assistance for college and higher education teach grant non federal student aid employer voucher private loans undergraduate book grant see the discussion under regulation of our business below for more information about military and veterans benefits and federal student aid  including the discussions of potential changes to these programs under regulation of our business nature of federal  state and private financial support for postsecondary education tuition assistance and regulation of our business regulation of title iv financial aid programs the rule 
enrollment and student body our active student body consists of approximately  students  most of whom hold full time employment 
active students are defined as those who have completed a course in the past twelve months  or are currently enrolled or registered for an upcoming course 
we disenroll students who fail to register for and complete at least one course in a calendar year  although they may later apply for re admission and active status 
students on extended military deployments may apply for a program hold  which keeps them active until they return and are able to resume their studies 
faculty as of december   our faculty consists of approximately  members with relevant teaching and practitioner experience 
approximately members were designated as full time faculty  and more than  members were serving as adjunct faculty 
a significant majority of our graduate faculty hold a doctorate in the relevant field  while virtually all undergraduate faculty have earned a graduate degree 
exceptions have been granted for a limited number of faculty that may not meet the degree standards  but evidence significant experience and achievement in the subject area that they teach 
we establish full time and adjunct positions based on program and course enrollment 
many full time faculty began their career with us as adjunct members 
as enrollment increases  we expect to establish additional full time positions as well as additional adjunct positions 
we attract faculty through referrals by current faculty members  advertisements in education and trade association journals  and our internet presence 
program managers and department chairs review applications and conduct interviews 
we check references prior to offering positions to new faculty and  upon selection  we require each new faculty member to complete an orientation and training program that leads to their certification and assignment 
many of our faculty members have relevant experience at leading universities and within military and governmental institutions 
we believe that the composition of our student body and course curriculum is particularly attractive to potential faculty members because of the opportunity to teach relevant material to students that are involved on a daily basis in implementing what is being taught 
in turn  we believe that our well regarded faculty  including many former and current practitioners in their fields  attracts new students with interest in these fields 
we believe that the quality of our faculty is critical to our success because our most frequent interaction with our students is through our faculty members 
we regularly review the performance of our faculty by monitoring the amount of online contact that faculty have with students  reviewing student feedback  and evaluating the learning outcomes achieved by students  among other measures 
if we determine that a faculty member is not performing at the level that we require  we work with the faculty member to improve performance  including through assigning the faculty member a mentor 
if the faculty member s performance does not improve  we will no longer allow that faculty member to teach 
we do not provide our faculty with tenure 
partnership at a distance we have established proprietary information systems and processes to support what we refer to as partnership at a distance  or pad 
pad is the patented approach to how we interact with our students 
at its center is a dynamic information system enabling us to recognize that every student is unique and to provide individualized support at appropriate times from pre enrollment through and beyond graduation including student advising  administrative support  or community networking 
by avoiding a one size fits all approach  the system provides us with the flexibility to maintain a highly engaged partnership with our learners based on their preferences 
pad has allowed us to scale and improve the quality of our academic offerings and student support 
we believe pad enables us to cost effectively manage and administer monthly starts that exceed  classes in over  unique courses and serve approximately  students taught by over  faculty members 
we obtained patent protection on pad in february american public university system is pursuing patent protection on several innovations that enhance support student academic achievement and streamline university operations 
other technology systems and management we believe that we have established a functional  secure and reliable technology system to help us fulfill our mission 
we continue to invest in technology systems and enhancements to support this system and our growth 
our it infrastructure consists of two data centers one in virginia  and one at a co location facility in texas 
our technology environment is managed internally 
student access is provided through redundant data carriers in both data centers 
in  we chose the sakai collaboration and learning environment sakai cle  an open source learning management system  to replace educator  our prior learning management system as the foundational software for our online classroom 
as of  more than educational institutions around the world were reportedly using sakai cle to support teaching  learning  research  and collaboration 
we completed the implementation of sakai cle in the fall of shortly after the completion of the migration  we experienced periods of unplanned downtime in our online classroom during periods of peak utilization 
we believe that in mid october we identified the cause of this downtime and took appropriate steps to mitigate the problem 
since these changes were made  the sakai cle has been stable and available to students and faculty with peak utilization in excess of those seen in october  competition there are more than  us colleges and universities serving traditional college age students and adult students 
competition is highly fragmented and varies by geography  program offerings  delivery method  ownership  quality level  and selectivity of admissions 
no one institution has a significant share of the total postsecondary market 
within our primary military market  there are more than  institutions that serve military students and receive tuition assistance funds 
our primary competitors for military students are other institutions offering online bachelor and master degrees and traditional colleges and universities located near military installations 
we believe that for profit schools may increasingly be seeking to attract military students for various reasons  including because these schools may see it as helpful in their efforts to comply with the rule  as currently dod tuition assistance and veterans education benefits do not count towards the limit 
see regulation of our business regulation of title iv financial aid programs the rule below for more information on the rule  including recent proposals to count dod tuition assistance and veterans education benefits toward the limit 
we compete with not for profit public and private two year and four year colleges as well as other for profit schools  particularly those that offer online learning programs 
public and private colleges and universities  as well as other for profit schools  offer programs similar to those that we offer 
public institutions receive substantial government subsidies  and public and private institutions have access to government and foundation grants  tax deductible contributions  and other financial resources generally not available to for profit schools 
accordingly  public and private institutions may have instructional and support resources that are superior to those in the for profit sector 
in addition  some of our competitors  including both traditional colleges and universities and other for profit schools  have substantially greater name recognition and financial and other resources than we have  which may enable them to compete more effectively for potential students 

we are also continuing to see increasing differentiation between the way in which our competitors are delivering online offerings  which impacts the ability to attract students  facilitate access to education and provide convenience to learners 
we believe that in the future many online students will be attracted to institutions in part because of the technology that the institutions offer and the way in which that technology facilitates access to education and learning 
in addition  we face new competition from various emerging non traditional  credit bearing and non credit bearing education programs provided by proprietary  not for profit and public providers  including massively open online courses moocs offered worldwide without charge by traditional educational institutions and other direct to consumer education services  as well as other offerings at low costs to students 
the primary competitive factors for institutions targeting working adult students include specific degree program offerings  affordability  including tuition and fees and rates of increase  convenience and flexibility  including availability of online courses and the use of education related technology  reputation and academic quality  and marketing effectiveness 
intellectual property we exercise rights associated with patents  copyrights  trademarks  service marks  domain names  agreements  and registrations to protect our intellectual property

intellectual property of individual faculty members  such as weekly notes or lectures  remains the property of the faculty member  and is reserved specifically for use only by the faculty member who owns it  unless he she grants permission for use by others 
we have secured rights to trademarks for various names and terms used in our business  including american public university system  american military university  american public university ready when you are  respected

and the term partnership at a distance 
we believe these trademarks and brand names are important to how prospective students identify us and are central to a number of our marketing efforts 
we also own rights to more than internet domain names pertaining to apus  amu  apu and other unique descriptors 
the patent and trademark office issued apus a patent for our proprietary student information and service system  pad  in february american public university system is also pursuing patents on several innovations that we believe enhance and support student academic achievement and streamline university operations 
employees as of december   we had approximately  members of faculty and a professional staff of approximately non faculty employees administering our academic  technology  service  and business operations 
most of our non faculty employees work in either our headquarters in charles town  west virginia  or in our administrative offices in manassas  virginia 
none of our employees are parties to any collective bargaining arrangement 
we believe that we have good relationships with our employees

you may obtain information on the operation of the public reference room by calling the sec at sec regulation of our business we are subject to extensive regulation by state regulatory bodies  accrediting agencies recognized by the us secretary of education  the federal government through the us department of education and under the higher education act of  as amended  or the higher education act  the department of veterans affairs  and the department of defense 
the regulations  standards and policies of these agencies cover the vast majority of our operations  including our educational programs  facilities  instructional and administrative staff  administrative procedures  marketing  recruiting  financial operations and financial condition 
as an institution of higher education that grants degrees  diplomas and certificates  we are required to be authorized by appropriate state education authorities 
in addition  in certain states as a condition of continued authorization to grant degrees and in order to participate in various federal programs  including tuition assistance programs of the united states armed forces  an institution must be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the secretary of education 
accreditation is a non governmental process through which an institution submits to qualitative review by an organization of peer institutions  based on the standards of the accrediting agency and the stated aims and purposes of the institution 
the higher education act requires accrediting agencies recognized by the secretary of education to review and monitor many aspects of an institution s operations and to take appropriate action when the institution fails to comply with the accrediting agency s standards 
our operations are also subject to regulation due to our participation in federal student financial aid programs under title iv of the higher education act  which we refer to in this annual report as title iv programs 
title iv programs  which are administered by the department of education  include loans with below market interest rates that are made directly to students by the department of education 
title iv programs also include several grant programs for students with the greatest economic need as determined in accordance with the higher education act and department of education regulations 
to participate in title iv programs  a school must receive and maintain authorization by the appropriate state education agencies  be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the secretary of education  and be certified as an eligible institution by the department of education 
state education licensure we are currently authorized to offer our programs by the west virginia higher education policy commission  the regulatory agency governing postsecondary education in the state of west virginia  where we are headquartered 
we are also authorized to operate as an out of state institution by the state council of higher education for virginia 
we are authorized in virginia because we have administrative offices there  which requires state authorization under virginia laws 
at present  we enroll students from each of the states  as well as the district of columbia 
we have sought and received confirmation that our operations do not require state licensure or authorization  or we have been notified that we are exempt from licensure or authorization requirements in states 
the university and its representatives are licensed or authorized to operate or to conduct activities in the remaining states and the district of columbia alabama  arkansas  florida  georgia  illinois  kansas  louisiana  maryland  minnesota  montana  nevada  new mexico  pennsylvania  virginia  washington  west virginia  wisconsin and wyoming 
in some cases  state licensure or authorization may impose limitations on certain activities and may impose particular requirements with respect to certain programs 
to date  such state specific limitations and requirements have not had a material effect on our operations 
new program initiatives  such as our teacher education programs  that include on the ground components eg  student teaching  professional internships  etc 
that may be described as instructional activities  will be viewed by some state regulatory agencies as constituting a physical presence for regulatory purposes 
as those programs expand  there is a high probability that we will need to seek formal authorization to operate in some states where historically we were not required to do so 
the extent of this expansion in regulatory requirements  and the associated costs  are not known at this time  but we anticipate they may be significant 
furthermore  there may be some states where it takes a significant amount of time to meet the applicable regulatory requirements with respect to a new program initiative  or where we are not able to do so at all 
the increasing popularity and use of the internet and other online services for the delivery of education has led to the adoption of new laws and regulatory practices in the united states and foreign countries and to new interpretations of existing laws and regulations 
for instance  in some states we are required to seek licensure or authorization because our recruiters meet with prospective students in the state 
in other states  the state education agency requires licensure or authorization because  for example  we enroll students or employ faculty who reside in the state 
we are currently subject to extensive regulations by the states in which we are authorized or licensed to operate 
state laws typically establish standards for instruction  qualifications of faculty  administrative procedures  marketing  recruiting  financial operations and other operational matters 
state laws and regulations may limit our ability to offer educational programs and to award degrees 
some states may also prescribe financial regulations that are different from those of the department of education  and may require the posting of surety bonds 
if we fail to comply with state licensing requirements  we may lose our state licensure or authorizations 
we believe that under current law the only state authorization or licensure necessary for us to participate in the tuition assistance programs of the united states armed forces is our authorization from the west virginia higher education policy commission 
we believe the same is true for the title iv programs 
as described elsewhere in this annual report  the department of education promulgated a regulation to require institutions that offer postsecondary education through distance education to students in a state in which the institution is not physically located or in which it is otherwise subject to the state s jurisdiction to meet the state s requirements for postsecondary distance education providers  but a federal court vacated that regulation 
failure to comply with the requirements of the west virginia higher education policy commission could result in our losing authorization from the west virginia higher education policy commission  eligibility to participate in title iv programs  or our ability to offer certain programs  any of which may force us to cease operations 
failure to comply with authorization or licensure requirements in other states could restrict our ability to recruit or enroll students in those states 
on october   the department of education published final regulations that address certain institutional eligibility issues  including state authorization 
the final regulations  which generally took effect july   specify new rules regarding the type of state approvals that are acceptable for an institution to demonstrate that it is authorized by the state where it is located to offer educational programs beyond the secondary level 
in addition  in order for an institution to be legally authorized under the final regulations  the relevant state must have a process to review and take appropriate action on complaints concerning postsecondary institutions 
if the department of education determines that an institution does not have the required state authorization to provide an educational program beyond secondary education in the state in which the institution is physically located  the institution will be ineligible to participate in the title iv programs 
the institution must be able to document to the department of education  upon request  the state s approval 
as described below in regulation of title iv financial aid programs distance learning  the final regulations also established a new rule related to state authorization and distance education 
under the rule  if an institution offers postsecondary education through distance education to students in a state in which the institution is not physically located or in which it is otherwise subject to the state s jurisdiction as determined by the state  the institution must meet the state s requirements for postsecondary distance education providers 
in july  the us district court for the district of columbia vacated the distance education state authorization rule 
the department of education has appealed that ruling 
see regulation of title iv financial aid programs distance learning  below  for more information 
certain states may be required to adopt new laws or regulations to comply with the new state authorization requirements in order to enable institutions in those states to continue to participate in title iv programs 
the new rules related to distance education may also lead some states to adopt new laws and regulatory practices affecting the delivery of distance education to students located in those states 
for example  more states may require that online education institutions be licensed in their state despite having no physical location or other presence in that state or may increase requirements applicable to institutions already required to be licensed 
in addition  changes in our business or changes in the nature or amount of our contact with or presence within a particular state could lead states that do not currently require us to be licensed or authorized to require such licensure or authorization in the future 
in addition to the concerns expressed above  new laws  regulations or interpretations related to doing business over the internet could increase our cost of doing business and affect our ability to recruit students in particular states  which could  in turn  negatively affect enrollments and revenues and have a material adverse effect on our business 
accreditation we received institutional accreditation in from the higher learning commission of the north central association of colleges and schools  a regional accrediting agency recognized by the secretary of education 
in december  the higher learning commission approved expansion of our mission to include liberal arts bachelors degrees 
as part of the regularly scheduled evaluation process  we submitted a self study in january and underwent an on site reaccreditation visit in february in july  the higher learning commission reaffirmed our accreditation status 
our next comprehensive evaluation is scheduled for the academic year  with an interim progress report on development of university system wide coordination and improvement of graduate studies due in july we were also accredited by the accrediting commission of the distance education and training council  or detc  until april   when we voluntarily withdrew our accreditation 
accreditation is a non governmental system for recognizing educational institutions and their programs for student performance  governance  integrity  educational quality  faculty  physical resources  administrative capability and resources  and financial stability 
in the united states  this recognition comes primarily through private voluntary associations that accredit institutions or programs of higher education 
to be recognized by the secretary of education  accrediting agencies must adopt specific standards and procedures for their review of educational institutions or programs 
accrediting agencies establish criteria for accreditation  conduct peer review evaluations of institutions and programs  and publicly designate those institutions that meet their criteria 
accredited schools are subject to periodic review by accrediting agencies to determine whether such schools maintain the performance  integrity  and quality required for accreditation 
the higher learning commission is the same accrediting agency that accredits such universities as the university of chicago  northwestern university  west virginia university  and other degree granting public and private colleges and universities in its region including arkansas  arizona  colorado  iowa  illinois  indiana  kansas  michigan  minnesota  missouri  north dakota  nebraska  ohio  oklahoma  new mexico  south dakota  west virginia  wisconsin and wyoming 
accreditation by the higher learning commission is an important attribute of our university 
colleges and universities depend  in part  on accreditation in evaluating transfers of credit and applications to graduate schools 
employers rely on the accredited status of institutions when evaluating a candidate s credentials  and students and corporate and government sponsors under tuition reimbursement programs look to accreditation for assurance that an institution maintains quality educational standards 
moreover  institutional accreditation by an accrediting agency recognized by the secretary of education is necessary for eligibility to participate in tuition assistance programs of the united states armed forces and title iv programs 
in november and december  the department of education s office of the inspector general  or oig  issued reports criticizing three accrediting agencies  including the higher learning commission  for failing to define both program length and credit hours 
oig explained that such failures could result in inflated credit hours  improper designation of full time student status  and over awarding of title iv funds 
oig  in an unusual action  recommended that the department of education consider limiting  suspending  or terminating the higher learning commission s recognition as an accrediting agency for purposes of determining institutional eligibility to participate in title iv programs 
in response  department of education staff conducted a special review of the higher learning commission 
according to a staff report submitted to the national advisory committee on institutional quality and integrity  or naciqi the panel charged with advising the department of education on whether to recognize accrediting agencies for federal purposes  including title iv purposes  as a result of the special review  the department of education required the higher learning commission to develop a corrective action plan that  among other things  required modification of its substantive change policies and implementation of specific procedures to address changes in ownership 
in august  the higher learning commission submitted its response to the department of education s special review 
in december  naciqi reviewed the higher learning commission s status as a recognized accrediting agency based on the august response to the special review and a december interim report  the latter of which responded to a naciqi review unrelated to the oig report that occurred in naciqi voted to continue the higher learning commission s recognition as an accrediting agency but also ordered the agency to submit an additional compliance report in one year 
at its december meeting  naciqi characterized the higher learning commission s report as informal and noted that no vote was to be taken on it 
as explained elsewhere in this annual report  on october   the department of education published final regulations that  in part  seek to address oig s concerns regarding measurement of credit hours 
in november  the higher learning commission revised its policies to address the department of education s new regulations regarding credit hours 
if the higher learning commission were to lose its ability to serve as an accrediting agency for title iv programs  we may lose our ability to participate in title iv programs 
naciqi is next scheduled to review the higher learning commission for recognition purposes on june  the higher learning commission received further scrutiny in march during a hearing of the senate health education labor and pension  or help committee  focused on accreditation of proprietary institutions 
we believe that regional accreditation has been important in our outreach to military personnel  who we believe are often counseled that regional accreditation is an important consideration when selecting a postsecondary institution 
similarly  obtaining regional accreditation has allowed us to reach additional service members by joining portions of the servicemembers opportunity colleges degree network system  a department of defense  or dod  program that promotes its member institutions to military professionals and that was previously closed to us 
in addition to institutional accreditation  certain specialized accrediting agencies accredit specific programs at our university 
accreditation of a program by a specialized accrediting agency signifies that the program meets the standards of that agency 
we have the following specialized accreditations accreditation council for business schools and programs accredits our associate of arts in business administration  bachelor of business administration  bachelor of arts in marketing  master of business administration commission on collegiate nursing education accredits our bachelor of science in nursing 
in addition  we have obtained professional recognition for our emergency and disaster management program from the foundation for higher education accreditation  for our management program from the society of human resources  for our sports and health sciences program by the american sport education program  and for our child and family development program by the national council on family relations 
if we fail to satisfy the standards of these specialized accrediting agencies  we could lose the specialized accreditation for the affected programs  which could result in materially reduced student enrollments in those programs and prevent our students from seeking and obtaining appropriate licensure in their fields 
nature of federal  state and private financial support for postsecondary education our students finance their education through a combination of individual resources  tuition assistance programs of the united states armed forces administered by the department of defense  or dod  education benefits administered by the department of veterans affairs  private loans  corporate reimbursement programs  and title iv programs 
participation in these programs adds to the regulation of our operations 
tuition assistance 
service members of the united states armed forces are eligible to receive tuition assistance from their branch of service through the uniform tuition assistance program of the dod 
service members may use this tuition assistance to pursue postsecondary degrees at postsecondary institutions that are accredited by accrediting agencies that are recognized by the secretary of education 
for our undergraduate programs we have established tuition rates per semester credit hour that can be covered by dod tuition assistance funds to undergraduate military students to attend our institution provided that the student does not exceed the annual limits per student 
each branch of the armed forces has established its own rules for dod tuition assistance programs 
pursuant to these rules  in order for a service member to use his or her tuition assistance funds at american public university system  or apus  we need to maintain our state licensure and our regional accreditation and the service member must maintain satisfactory academic progress and must also progress in a timely manner toward completion of his or her degree  among other requirements 
to the extent that tuition assistance programs do not cover the full cost of tuition for service members  service members may also use their benefits under the montgomery gi bill or the post veterans educational assistance act of  or the post gi bill  as amended  through the gi bills top up feature 
the us department of veterans affairs  or va  administers the gi bills 
pursuant to federal law related to those programs  we are approved for education of veterans and members of the selective reserve and their dependents by the state approving agencies in virginia and west virginia 
on april   the department of veterans affairs began an on site program review of our programs 
the on site review was concluded on april   and we have not yet received a formal report from the department of veterans affairs 
if we lost our eligibility to receive tuition assistance from the united states armed forces  or if the amount of tuition assistance per service member is reduced  military service members would need to seek alternative funds 
while they may be able to use their education benefits under the montgomery gi bill or post gi bill in lieu of dod tuition assistance funds  we believe that option would not be attractive to these students 
as a result  the inability to participate in dod tuition assistance programs  and any reduction in the funding for dod tuition assistance programs  could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
in  both the us congress and dod increased their focus on dod tuition assistance that is used for distance education and programs at proprietary institutions 
in august  dod issued proposed regulations that would increase oversight of educational programs offered to active duty service members 
related to this effort  dod drafted a memorandum of understanding  or mou  to articulate the commitment that institutions providing education services must make in order to receive dod tuition assistance program funds 
on march   dod circulated the mou and requested that institutions execute it before january  the draft mou met with substantial criticism  including from the american council on education and us senators 
despite this  some institutions executed the mou before the deadline  including us 
in response to the criticisms received  dod revised the regulations and the mou 
the final regulations and mou  published december  and effective january   require all institutions to sign a mou  by march  institutions that have executed a mou with dod can retain their current mou or choose to execute the new mou 
the mou outlines certain commitments and agreements between the institution and dod prior to accepting funds under the tuition assistance program 
for example  the mou requires institutions to participate in the dod third party assessment to ensure compliance with the mou and that service members are provided quality voluntary education opportunities that meet their needs 
the third party assessment of american military university was conducted in june with a revised report submitted in october the report stated that based on the assessment team findings  american military university and american public university system are in full compliance with the dod voluntary education partnership mou 
the mou does not require institutions to become members of the servicemembers opportunity colleges degree network system like us  but all institutions must disclose certain information such as transfer credit policies and provide certain resources for service members such as designating a person or office to serve as a point of contact for service members inquiring about academic counseling  financial aid counseling  and student support services 
in addition  as part of dod efforts to eliminate aggressive marketing aimed at service members  institutions that execute the mou must not provide any commission  bonus  or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on securing enrollments or federal financial aid including tuition assistance funds to any persons or entities engaged in any student recruiting  admission activities  or making decisions regarding the award of student financial assistance 
we have executed the mou originally circulated on march  the dod may draft and circulate a revised mou and require that institutions execute the agreement in order to receive dod tuition assistance program funds 
the requirement to enter into a mou  and the related increased focus by the dod on relationships and oversight of educational providers  could lead to changes in the nature of our relationships with military bases and educational service officers including possibly needing to enter into separate installation mous and obtain permission to counsel students in person on the installation  which could be adverse in nature 
furthermore  installations may impose additional requirements 
for example  at least one installation has banned educational providers from directly counseling potential students on the installation  and additional installations may determine to institute similar bans 
in september  the us house of representatives armed services committee s subcommittee on oversight and investigations held a hearing entitled a question of quality and value department of defense oversight of tuition assistance used for distance learning and for profit colleges 
both dod officials and subcommittee members expressed concern about dod s oversight of distance education programs  especially those offered by proprietary institutions 
similarly  in december  the senate health education labor pensions committee  or help committee  released a report entitled benefitting whom for profit education companies and the growth of military educational benefits  which raised questions about the growing share of dod tuition assistance and post veterans educational assistance act of benefits received by proprietary institutions 
in march  the government accountability office  or gao  published a report entitled dod education benefits increased oversight of tuition assistance program is needed  which offered several recommendations for improving accountability within the tuition assistance program 
in september  the senate subcommittee on federal financial management  government information  federal services  and international security held a hearing focused on the classification of military education benefits under the rule  which requires institutions receiving title iv aid to derive at least percent of their revenue from non title iv program sources 
some of the panelists suggested that the classification of military benefits as a non title iv program revenue source has led some for profit institutions to recruit aggressively and sometimes illegally members of the military in order to ensure compliance with the rule 
senator harkin  chairman of the senate committee on health  education  labor pensions spoke on the senate floor on may  and hosted a press conference on september  to encourage reformation of the rule 
see the discussion below under regulation of title iv financial aid programs the rule for further discussion of proposed changes to the manner in which the rule is calculated 
at this time  we cannot predict the extent to which  or whether  the congressional hearings and report  or advocacy from other organizations or parts of the government  will affect dod s current rulemaking or result in legislation or other regulations that would limit or condition the participation of proprietary institutions or distance education programs in dod tuition assistance programs 
in october  the marine corps announced  and later rescinded  new tuition assistance rules that cut the maximum benefit for its service members from  per year to per year and reduced the tuition assistance from per credit hour to per credit hour 
although undergraduate tuition assistance levels have been restored to their prior levels with retroactive benefits to affected service members  the marine corps has warned that the current levels of funding are not sustainable 
the marine corps did reduce graduate level tuition assistance from per credit hour to per credit hour  which is consistent with the current tuition assistance payments from the other military services 
we anticipate that the other services will also consider potential changes to the tuition assistance program 
in addition  in october  dod announced that while it will maintain the current levels of tuition assistance in the near term  it plans to consider changes as part of a holistic review of the military compensation package 
we believe modifications to the tuition assistance program may include a reduced per undergraduate credit tuition benefit currently  a decrease in the annual cap currently  and or a requirement that service members pay out of pocket for a portion of their tuition  among other possible changes 
if tuition assistance payments are reduced  we believe that most service members would be eligible and able to finance out of pocket tuition costs resulting from this shortfall using their top up benefits under the gi bills  which allow service members to use a portion of their gi bill benefits while still on active duty 
however  we do not know whether in the long term service members would be willing to use the top up option  or whether the increased administrative process in using the top up option or covering the shortfall through other funding sources would lead to service members deciding not to enroll or enrolling at a slower rate 
on april   senators kay hagan and tom harkin introduced legislation  titled the protecting financial aid for students and taxpayers act  that would prohibit colleges and universities from using funds from title iv programs  military tuition assistance  veterans education benefits programs  and other federal educational assistance funds to pay for marketing  advertising  and recruiting 
on june   the senate appropriations committee reported a fiscal year appropriations bill that included language from the protecting financial aid for students and taxpayers act bill 
both the appropriations bill and the protecting financial aid for students and taxpayers act bill expired when the th congress ended on january  were similar legislation introduced in the th congress and became law  it would significantly affect our ability to identify and attract prospective students 
we are unable to estimate the effect of future expected changes to the tuition assistance programs or whether the services would impose other criteria in addition to the level of reimbursement that would impact enrollments from service members 
we are also unable to estimate the response that our competitors would take to reduced tuition assistance payments or the willingness of service members to use the top up option available under the veterans education benefits programs 
in this regard  our competitors  particularly those with larger student populations or a smaller concentration of students from the military  may be better situated to lower the cost of tuition to service members 
if we are no longer able to receive tuition assistance payments or the tuition assistance program is reduced or eliminated  our enrollments and revenues could be significantly reduced  which would result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
title iv programs 
the federal government provides a substantial part of its support for postsecondary education through title iv programs  in the form of grants and loans to students who can use those funds at any institution that has been certified by the department of education to participate in title iv programs 
title iv program aid is primarily awarded on the basis of financial need  generally defined as the difference between the cost of attending the institution and the amount a student can reasonably contribute to that cost 
all recipients of title iv program funds must maintain satisfactory academic progress and must also progress in a timely manner toward completion of their program of study 
in addition  each school must ensure that title iv program funds are properly accounted for and disbursed in the correct amounts to eligible students 
we were first certified to participate in title iv programs in september the department of education has approved us to participate in the following title iv programs described below the federal family education loan program  or the ffel program  william d 
ford federal direct loan program  or the direct loan program  the federal pell grant program  campus based programs  and teacher education assistance for college and higher education grant program  or the teach grant program 
ffel program 
on march   president obama signed the healthcare and education affordability reconciliation act of the legislation  which is known for its overhaul of the healthcare system  eliminated the ffel program 
under the ffel program  banks and other lending institutions made loans to students and parents of dependent students 
as of july   those lending institutions are no longer able to act as lenders of federal student loans  and no new loans could be originated through the ffel program 
instead  institutions were required to transition to the direct loan program by july  in order to continue to participate in the major federal loan programs 
this deadline did not affect american public university system  or apus  as we had ceased to participate actively in the direct loan program as of december  the ffel program includes the federal stafford loan program  the federal plus program which  beginning on july   provided for loans to graduate and professional students as well as parents of dependent undergraduate students  and the federal consolidation loan program 
if a student defaults on a loan  payment is guaranteed by a federally recognized guaranty agency  which is then reimbursed by the department of education 
students who demonstrate financial need may qualify for a subsidized stafford loan 
with a subsidized stafford loan  the federal government will pay the interest on the loan while the student is in school and during any approved periods of deferment  until the student s obligation to repay the loan begins 
unsubsidized stafford loans are available to students who do not qualify for a subsidized stafford loan or  in some cases  in addition to a subsidized stafford loan 
direct loan program 
under the direct loan program  the department of education makes loans directly to students rather than guaranteeing loans made by lending institutions 
the direct loan program includes the direct subsidized loan  the direct unsubsidized loan  the direct plus loan including loans to graduate and professional students  and the direct consolidation loan 
the terms and conditions of the direct subsidized loan  the direct unsubsidized loan  the direct plus loan  and the direct consolidation loan are generally comparable to those of the federal stafford subsidized loan  the federal stafford unsubsidized loan  the federal plus loan  and the federal consolidation loan  respectively 
as of june   apus has originated all new loans for students and their parents through the direct loan program 
the budget control act of  signed into law on august   eliminated direct subsidized loans for graduate and professional students  as of july  the terms and conditions of subsidized loans originated prior to july  are unaffected by the law 
federal grant programs 
grants under the federal pell grant program are available to eligible students based on financial need and other factors 
an institution that is certified for pell grant purposes is considered to be certified for the academic competitiveness grant  or the acg grant  program and national science and mathematics access to retain talent grant  or the smart grant  program  if it has at least one academic program that is acg grant smart grant eligible 
however  authorization for the acg grant program and smart grant program expired as of july  campus based programs 
the campus based title iv programs include the federal supplemental education opportunity grant program  the federal work study program and the federal perkins loan program 
we do not actively participate in any campus based program 
teacher education assistance for college and higher education teach grant program 
the teach grant program provides up to  a year in grant assistance to undergraduate  post baccalaureate  and graduate students who agree to serve for at least four years as full time highly qualified teachers in high need fields in public or not for profit private elementary or secondary schools that serve students from low income families 
in august  president obama signed the budget control act of  which provided for both an increase in the federal government borrowing authority and reductions in spending 
the budget control act of eliminated the in school interest exemption for graduate student loans beginning july  the cost of borrowing will increase for graduate students who defer payment of interest while enrolled  which could adversely impact our enrollments 
also  under the budget control act of  congress must develop legislation to achieve further deficit reduction  and the outcome of this process is uncertain 
unless congress takes further action  automatic  across the board reductions in federal spending also known as sequestration will begin on march  the budget control act of and the statutory pay as you go act of each provide for the possibility of sequestration as a budgetary enforcement tool 
on january   congress enacted the american taxpayer relief act of  which delayed potential sequestration under the budget control act of until march  if sequestration is triggered by either the budget control act of or the statutory pay as you go act of  funding for title iv programs would be affected 
pell grants would be exempt from cuts through fiscal year  but could be subject to sequestration in fiscal year and beyond 
most other federal student aid programs would be subject to across the board cuts to discretionary programs at a rate of approximately 
origination fees for stafford loans and plus loans would increase approximately  to approximately and of the total loan  respectively 
cuts to the department of education federal student aid administration budget could lead to delays in student eligibility determinations and delays in processing and origination of federal student loans 
the house committee on the budget released a report in january stating that programs administered by the department of veterans affairs will be exempt from sequestration  however  there are no such assurances with respect to the tuition assistance programs of the department of defense 
although the pell grant program and programs administered by the department of veterans affairs currently are exempt from the sequestration process  other federal programs and services that could affect our business could be included 
any action by congress that significantly reduces title iv program funding  whether through across the board funding cuts or otherwise  or materially impacts our eligibility or our students eligibility to participate in title iv programs would have a material adverse effect on our enrollment  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
on september   the department of education updated waivers and modifications of provisions governing the title iv programs for the benefit of individuals who are performing qualifying military service or individuals who are affected by a disaster  war or other military operation or national emergency under the authority of the higher education relief opportunities for students act of  or heroes act 
the department of education acted to bring provisions into compliance with statutes and regulations enacted and promulgated after these provisions were originally published 
private lenders 
in certain circumstances  our students may access alternative loan programs 
alternative loans are intended to cover the difference between what the student receives from all financial aid sources and the full cost of the student education 
students can apply to a number of different lenders for this funding at current market interest rates 
since its creation in  the consumer financial protection bureau  or cfpb  has taken steps to regulate student loans 
in  it issued two reports identifying concerns about the student loan market and published nearly  complaints from borrowers of private student loans 
in december  cfpb issued procedures describing how it will conduct examinations of financial institutions that make educational loans to determine their compliance with existing laws and regulations 
the procedures are designed to assess whether a lender engages in accurate and non discriminatory advertising and marketing  provides proper and clear disclosures  supplies accurate account information to borrowers  and has adequate channels to receive customer questions and complaints 
in january  cfpb encouraged institutions of higher education  students  and others to provide information by march  about the financial products and services currently offered to students  and comments on how current and future arrangements between institutions of higher education and financial institutions could be structured in order to promote positive financial decision making among consumers 
congress is considering bills that would affect private loans to students 
on january   senator durbin introduced the know before you owe private student loan act of  which would require institutions to certify to a private loan lender a student cost of attendance and estimated federal financial assistance before a loan may be issued to such student 
the act would also require institutions to counsel students about their loan options  including discussion of differences between federal loans and private loans 
private loan lenders would be required to provide students with quarterly account updates on the balance and interest accrued 
on january   senator durbin also introduced the fairness for struggling students act of  which would allow private student loans to be dischargeable in bankruptcy 
we do not know what steps congress may take in response to these actions and whether such actions if any will have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
additional sources of financial support 
in addition to the programs stated above  eligible students may participate in several other financial aid programs or receive support from other governmental and private sources 
for example  some of our students who are veterans use their benefits under the gi bills to cover their tuition 
certain of our students are also eligible to receive funds from other education assistance programs administered by the department of veterans affairs 
pursuant to federal law providing benefits for veterans and reservists  we are approved for education of veterans and members of the selective reserve and their dependents by the state approving agencies in virginia and west virginia 
finally  some of our students finance their own education or receive full or partial tuition reimbursement from their employers 
the post gi bill expanded education benefits for veterans who have served on active duty since september   including reservists and members of the national guard 
as originally passed  the post gi bill provided that eligible veterans could receive benefits for tuition purposes up to the cost of in state tuition at the most expensive public institution of higher education in the state where the veteran was enrolled 
in addition  veterans who were enrolled in classroom based programs or blended programs programs that combine classroom learning and distance learning could receive monthly housing stipends  while veterans enrolled in wholly distance based programs were not entitled to a monthly housing stipend 
the provisions regarding education benefits for post veterans took effect august  the post gi bill also increased the amount of education benefits available to eligible veterans under pre existing montgomery gi bill 
the legislation also authorized expansion of service members ability to transfer veterans education benefits to family members 
on january   president obama signed the post veterans educational assistance improvements act of  or improvements act  which amends the post gi bill in several pertinent respects 
the improvements act alters the way benefits related to tuition and fees are calculated 
for nonpublic us institutions  the improvements act bases the benefits related to tuition and fees on the net cost to the student after accounting for state and federal aid  scholarships  institutional aid  fee waivers  and similar assistance rather than the charges established by the institution  and it replaces the state dependent benefit cap with a single national cap of  in addition  veterans pursuing a program of education solely through distance learning on a more than half time basis are eligible to receive up to of the national average of the basic housing allowance available to service members who are at military pay grade e and have dependents 
most improvements act changes took effect on august or october   though changes to rules regarding eligibility for benefits were effective immediately or retroactively to the effective date of the post gi bill 
the improvements act did not change the post gi bill s provision that allows veterans to receive up to  per academic year for books  supplies  equipment  and other education costs 
regulation of title iv financial aid programs to be eligible to participate in title iv programs  an institution must comply with specific standards and procedures set forth in the higher education act and the regulations issued thereunder by the department of education 
an institution must  among other things  be licensed or authorized to offer its educational programs by the state within which it is physically located in our case  west virginia and maintain institutional accreditation by a recognized accrediting agency 
in may  we were fully recertified to participate in title iv programs after having completed an initial period of participation during which we were provisionally certified 
in august  we were deemed to have undergone a change in ownership and control requiring review by the department of education in order to reestablish our eligibility and continue participation in title iv programs 
in connection with this review  we submitted to the department of education a change in ownership application that included the submission of required documentation  including a letter from the higher learning commission indicating that it had approved the change 
on october   we received a letter from the department of education approving the change in ownership and control and granting us provisional certification until september  on july   we received a letter from the department of education notifying us that we are fully recertified to participate in title iv programs through december   and that we are no longer provisionally certified 
see eligibility and certification procedure and regulatory actions and restrictions on operations below for more information 
the substantial amount of federal funds disbursed through title iv programs  the large number of students and institutions participating in these programs and allegations of fraud and abuse by certain for profit institutions have caused congress to initiate a congressional investigation into for profit institutions and to require the department of education to exercise considerable regulatory oversight over for profit institutions of higher learning 
accrediting agencies and state education agencies also have responsibilities for overseeing compliance of institutions with title iv program requirements 
as a result  our institution is subject to extensive oversight and review 
in  extensive new and amended department of education regulations went into effect 
the department of education has initiated a new rulemaking to address the federal student loan programs and teacher preparation programs  and congress recently enacted legislation that may lead to new department of education regulations 
the department periodically revises its regulations and changes its interpretations of existing laws and regulations 
for all these reasons  we cannot predict with certainty how the title iv program requirements will be applied in all circumstances 
see recent congressional action  recent regulatory changes  and pending regulatory changes below for more information 
significant factors relating to title iv programs that could adversely affect us include the following recent congressional action 
as explained below  in recent years  congress has enacted a number of substantial changes to title iv programs  both in terms of the structure of the programs themselves and the requirements imposed upon institutions participating in those programs 
congress has also initiated an examination of the for profit postsecondary education sector that could result in legislation or additional regulations that could materially affect our business 
in addition  on an annual basis  congress makes budgetary and appropriations decisions that could materially affect our business 
congress reauthorizes the higher education act approximately every five to six years 
on august   the higher education opportunity act  or heoa  the most recent reauthorization of the higher education act  was enacted 
heoa provisions are effective upon enactment  unless otherwise specified in the law 
selected heoa provisions are described in relevant parts of this annual report 
heoa includes numerous new and revised requirements for higher education institutions and thus increases substantially regulatory burdens imposed on such institutions under the higher education act 
during  the department of education developed regulations to implement heoa changes to the higher education act 
the department of education published final regulations in october those regulations took effect july  if our efforts to comply with heoa s provisions are inconsistent with how the department of education interprets those provisions  we may be found to be in noncompliance with such provisions and the department of education could impose monetary penalties  place limitations on our operations  and or condition or terminate our eligibility to receive title iv program funds 
on march   president obama signed the healthcare and education affordability reconciliation act of  or reconciliation act 
the reconciliation act  which is widely known for its overhaul of the healthcare system  amended the higher education act to eliminate the ffel program 
as of july   private banks could no longer act as lenders of federal student loans  and no new stafford  plus  or consolidation loans could be disbursed through the ffel program 
instead  institutions were required to transition to the direct loan program by july  in order to continue to participate in the major federal loan programs 
this deadline did not affect apus  as we had ceased to participate actively in the direct loan program as of december  as discussed above  on august   president obama signed the budget control act of  which among other things  eliminated direct subsidized loans for graduate and professional students  as of july  the terms and conditions of subsidized loans originated prior to july  are unaffected by the law 
on december   president obama signed the consolidated appropriations act of the law includes a number of provisions that significantly affect title iv programs 
for example  it reduces the income threshold at which students are assigned an automatic zero expected family contribution for purposes of awarding financial aid for the award year 
under the act  students who do not have a high school diploma or a recognized equivalent eg  ged or do not meet an applicable home school requirement and who first enroll in a program of study on or after july  will not be eligible to receive title iv aid 
the act also set the maximum pell grant award for at  and made several changes to the federal pell grant program  including establishing that  beginning with the award year  students may not receive a pell grant if they are not eligible for at least ten percent of the maximum pell grant award for the academic year and reducing the duration of a student s pell grant eligibility to semesters from semesters 
the act temporarily eliminates the interest subsidy provided for direct subsidized loans during the six month grace period immediately following termination of enrollment 
on january  president obama signed the improving transparency of education opportunities for veterans act 
this law is designed to help gi bill beneficiaries choose the school that best meets their educational needs by mandating that these beneficiaries receive certain information about available educational resources 
it requires the department of veterans affairs to establish a comprehensive policy for providing information to veterans and members of the armed forces regarding higher education and training programs  including a centralized mechanism to publish feedback from students and state approving agencies about each institution quality of instruction  recruiting practices  and placement of graduates 
the law permits institutions to verify the feedback and address any issues that they might identify with such feedback before it is published 
we cannot predict with certainty whether or when congress might act to amend further the higher education act 
for most programs subject to the act  the act provides funding authorization for programs until the end of fiscal  and the general education provisions act will automatically extend these authorizations to fiscal year we note  however  that the last time the higher education act was renewed  congress did not succeed in doing so until it was five years past its statutory renewal date 
given the significant budgetary and other issues facing the current congress  as well as the political climate  there is no reason to believe that the higher education act will be renewed during the th congress 
the elimination of additional title iv programs  material changes in the requirements for participation in such programs  or the substitution of materially different programs could increase our costs of compliance and could reduce the ability of certain students to finance their education at our institution 
beginning in june  the senate help committee held a series of hearings related to for profit postsecondary education institutions 
also in june  the house education and labor committee held a hearing to examine accreditors standards and procedures pertinent to higher education institutions policies on credit hours and program length  including those of the higher learning commission 
during each of the hearings  some committee members raised concerns about the growing proportion of federal student financial aid going to for profit schools 
on august   the senate help committee held a hearing to examine the student recruitment experience at for profit postsecondary education institutions  and on september   the senate help committee held a hearing on the federal investment in for profit education and the resulting student outcomes 
the senate help committee held additional hearings in on march   the committee held a hearing to present a case study of another for profit postsecondary education institution  its educational services  and the role of accreditor  state  and federal oversight 
on june   the senate help committee held a hearing on financial outcomes of students at for profit colleges 
at a number of hearings  committee members have expressed concern about the amount of student loan debt taken on by students at for profit institutions 
on july   the help committee hosted a roundtable discussion of policy solutions for improving for profit postsecondary education 
on june   the chairmen of the house and senate education committees  along with other members of congress  asked the general accountability office  or gao to review various aspects of the for profit education sector  including recruitment practices  educational quality  student outcomes  the sufficiency of integrity safeguards against waste  fraud and abuse in title iv programs  and the degree to which for profit schools revenue is comprised of title iv and other federal funding sources 
on august   the gao released a report based on a three month undercover investigation of recruiting practices at for profit schools 
the report concluded that employees at a non random sample of for profit schools which did not include apus made deceptive statements to students about accreditation  graduation rates  job placement  program costs  or financial aid 
on november   the gao issued a revised version of that report that corrected or further explained a number of the instances of allegedly deceptive conduct 
the gao reported that the revisions were made because additional information came to light and explained that the revisions do not alter any of its findings or the overall message of the report 
on october   the gao released a second report following additional undercover investigation related to enrollment  cost  financial aid  course structure  substandard student performance  withdrawal  and exit counseling 
the report concluded that while some of the unidentified for profit schools investigated appeared to follow existing policies  others did not 
although the report identified a number of deficiencies in specific instances  it made no recommendations 
on december   the gao released a report that attempted to compare the quality of education provided by for profit  not for profit  and public institutions based upon multiple outcome measures including graduation rates  pass rates on licensing exams  employment outcomes  and student loan default rates 
the report found that students at for profit institutions had higher graduation rates for certificate programs  similar graduation rates for associate s degree programs  and lower graduation rates for bachelor s degree programs than students at not for profit and public institutions 
it also found that a higher proportion of bachelor s degree recipients from for profit institutions took out loans than did degree recipients from other institutions and that some evidence exists that students at for profit institutions default on their student loans at higher rates 
on nine of the licensing exams reviewed  graduates of for profit institutions had lower pass rates than students from not for profit and public institutions 
on august   we were among for profit schools to receive a letter from senator tom harkin  chairman of the help committee  requesting documents as part of a review of matters related to for profit postsecondary education institutions whose students receive federal student financial aid 
the document request sought information on loan default rates  institutional spending  program costs  student outcomes  such as completion and placement rates  and recruiting practices  such as use of third party lead generators 
during a september  help committee hearing  senator harkin released a report entitled the return on federal investment in for profit education debt without a diploma 
the report  which was based in part on the analysis of documents received from some of the for profit schools without identifying any specific institutions  focused on for profit schools increasing profits  the growing proportion of federal funds flowing to for profit schools  and the high debt levels amassed by some for profit school students 
on july   the help committee issued a final report entitled for profit higher education the failure to safeguard the federal investment and ensure student success  which summarized the results of its investigations 
while the report acknowledged that for profit education institutions have a role to play in american society given insufficient capacity at not for profit and public education institutions  it made specific policy suggestions for future legislation that could affect proprietary institutions  including tying access to federal aid to meeting minimum student outcome thresholds  prohibiting institutions from funding marketing  advertising and recruiting activities with federal financial aid dollars  improving cohort default rate tracking by expanding the default reporting rate period beyond three years  requiring that proprietary colleges receive at least percent of revenues from sources other than federal funds  and using criteria beyond accreditation and state authorization for determining institutions access to federal financial aid 
the report was not adopted by the full committee  and the minority members released their own report criticizing the majority investigation in many aspects  including that it did not include a review of all institutions of higher education 
despite the fact that the full committee did not adopt the report  congress may consider the report as it begins the process of reauthorizing the higher education act 
we incurred significant legal and other costs in responding to the congressional inquiry 
we cannot predict the extent to which  or whether  congress s examination could lead to new legislation or department of education regulations that would limit or condition participation of for profit schools in title iv programs 
in addition  on an annual basis  congress reviews and determines appropriations for title iv programs through the budget and appropriations process 
a reduction in federal funding levels of such programs could reduce the ability of certain students to finance their education 
these changes  in turn  could lead to lower enrollments  require us to increase our reliance upon alternative sources of student financial aid and impact our growth plans 
the loss of or a significant reduction in title iv program funds available to our students could reduce our enrollment and revenue and possibly have a material adverse effect on our business and plans for growth 
in addition  the legislation and implementing regulations applicable to our operations have been subject to frequent revisions  many of which have increased the level of scrutiny to which for profit postsecondary education institutions are subjected and have raised applicable standards 
if we were not to continue to comply with legislation and implementing regulations applicable to our operations  such noncompliance might impair our ability to participate in title iv programs  offer educational programs or continue to operate 
certain of the statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to us are described below 
recent regulatory changes 
in  the department of education conducted negotiated rulemaking to develop regulations to address matters related to the integrity of title iv programs 
negotiated rulemaking is a process required by the higher education act to allow affected constituencies to share with the department of education their views on regulatory issues before the department issues proposed regulations 
the negotiated rulemaking addressed  among other topics  institutional eligibility issues such as state authorization for postsecondary education institutions  definitional issues such as the definition of gainful employment in a recognized occupation and credit hour for certain eligibility and other purposes  student eligibility issues including the validity of high school diplomas  and other title iv provisions such as incentive payments and misrepresentation 
the negotiated rulemaking committee failed to reach consensus on the entire regulatory package that was the subject of negotiation 
accordingly  the department of education was not required to use any language that was developed during negotiations  including language on which the negotiators reached tentative agreement 
on june   the department of education issued a notice of proposed rulemaking  or nprm  with respect to many of the issues subject to the negotiated rulemaking process  other than the metrics for determining compliance with the gainful employment requirement 
on july   the department of education issued an nprm regarding various elements of the gainful employment requirement  specifically the information that must be disclosed to prospective students  the information that must be reported to the department of education  and the metrics that will be used to determine compliance with the requirement 
on october   the department of education issued final regulations for those proposed in the june nprm  as well as final regulations regarding gainful employment programs  including disclosure and reporting requirements for programs that must prepare for gainful employment and procedures under which an institution must apply for approval to offer an educational program that prepares students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation 
the october final regulations were effective july  on june   the department of education published final regulations on metrics for gainful employment programs effective july  on january   the association of private sector colleges and universities  or apscu  filed a lawsuit in the us district court for the district of columbia challenging the october  final regulations on program integrity related to the state authorization  incentive compensation  and misrepresentation requirements on the grounds that such regulations exceeded the department of education s statutory and constitutional authority 
the district court vacated the section of the regulations that requires an institution that offers postsecondary education through distance education to students in a state in which the institution is not physically located or in which it is otherwise subject to the state s jurisdiction to meet the state s requirements for postsecondary distance education providers 
the district court let stand the remainder of the state authorization regulation as well as the regulations related to incentive compensation and misrepresentation 
on june   the us court of appeals for the district of columbia upheld the lower court ruling vacating the state authorization of online programs requirement and vacated portions of the substantial misrepresentation regulation that it found to exceed the higher education act limits 
on july   the department of education issued a dear colleague letter cautioning education institutions to remain in compliance with all applicable state laws and regulations related to distance education 
the department of education has not announced its next steps  but it may engage in the future in a negotiated rulemaking to address distance education and state authorization 
gainful employment 
to be eligible for title iv funding  certain academic programs  including all degree and non degree programs at proprietary institutions of higher education other than  in limited circumstances that apply to apus  certain liberal arts programs  must prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation 
the disclosure and reporting requirements and metrics for compliance are described below 
a disclosure beginning july   for the most recently completed award year  all institutions must disclose to prospective students  with respect to each of their gainful employment programs  occupations that the program prepares students to enter  total cost of the program  on time graduation rate  job placement rate  if applicable  and the median loan debt of program completers 
institutions must update such information within a reasonable period of time after the information becomes available 
b reporting with respect to each gainful employment program  institutions must annually report to the department of education information regarding each enrolled student  including the amount of debt incurred under private loans and institutional finance plans  matriculation information  and end of year enrollment information 
information related to award year the most recently completed award year as well as prior award years through must have been reported by november  institutions must report information for subsequent award years no earlier than september of the calendar year in which the award year ends but no later than the date established by the department of education through notice in the federal register 
if an institution is unable to supply all or some of the required information  it must provide an explanation to the department of education 
c metrics an academic program is considered to prepare students for gainful employment if it meets at least one of the following three metrics annual loan repayment rate 
this metric measures the rate at which the federal student loan debt incurred by the applicable cohort of borrowers to attend the program is being repaid 
generally  the annual loan repayment rate for an academic program is the percentage of federal student loans incurred to fund the costs of a program that are in satisfactory repayment three to four years after entering repayment 
rates are calculated on a federal fiscal year basis 
the repayment rate must be at least 
institutions have an opportunity to challenge the repayment rate data 
discretionary income ratio 
this metric compares i the annual repayment required on student loan debt attributable to tuition and fees by students who completed the program to ii their discretionary income 
the median annual loan payment amount calculated as described below for the applicable cohort of students may not be higher than of the greater of their average or median discretionary income 
discretionary income is the annual earnings of a program completer minus of the us department of health and human services  or hhs  poverty guideline for a single person in the continental united states 
the debt to discretionary income ratio examines students in their third or fourth year after graduation  calculated on a federal fiscal year basis 
the earnings used will generally be based on information received by the us department of education from the social security administration  subject under certain circumstances to the use of the th percentile of bureau of labor statistics income data for specific standard of occupational classification codes for fiscal years through annual earnings ratio 
this metric compares i the annual repayment required on student loan debt attributable to tuition and fees by students who completed the program to ii their actual annual earnings 
the median annual loan payment amount for the applicable cohort of students may not be greater than of the greater of their average or median annual earnings 
the debt to actual earnings ratio examines students in their third or fourth year after graduation  calculated on a federal fiscal year basis 
the earnings used will generally be based on information received by the us department of education from the social security administration  subject under certain circumstances to the use of the th percentile of bureau of labor statistics income data for specific standard of occupational classification codes for fiscal years through starting in  the department of education began to calculate the three metrics for each gainful employment program for each federal fiscal year  running from october to september an academic program that satisfied any one metric is considered to be preparing students for gainful employment 
if an academic program fails all three metrics  the institution will have the opportunity to improve the performance of that program 
after one failure  the institution must disclose to enrolled and prospective students the amount by which the program missed minimal acceptable performance and the program s plan for improvement 
after two failures within three years  the institution must inform prospective and current students in the failing program that their debt may be unaffordable  that the program may lose eligibility  and what transfer options exist 
after three failures within four years  the academic program loses eligibility to participate in title iv programs for at least three years  although the program may be continued without federal student aid 
these gainful employment standards are effective beginning july   and the department of education will begin calculating debt measures for fiscal year october  to september  
institutions will be notified of failing programs based on that data 
the earliest a program could lose eligibility under the gainful employment rule will be fiscal year  based on its  and performance under the above metrics 
eligibility losses in will be limited to the lowest five percent of all programs among all institutions 
on june   the department of education released data to institutions showing the calculation of gainful employment metrics based on data reported for federal fiscal years and the department of education released this information to the public on june  the released rates were for informational purposes only and are available from the department of education website 
in addition  final regulations issued october  require institutions to notify the department of education at least days before the commencement of a new educational program that prepares students for gainful employment in recognized occupations if the program has a classification of instructional programs  or cip  code under the taxonomy of instructional program classifications and descriptions developed by the national center for education statistics that is different from any other program offered by the institution  the program has the same cip code as another program offered by the institution but leads to a different degree or certificate  or the institution s accrediting agency determines the program to be an additional program 
this notification must include information on the market need for the program  any performed wage analysis  any external program review and approval  and a demonstration of accreditation 
the institution may proceed to offer the program  unless the department alerts the institution at least days before the first day of class that approval is required because the department has identified concerns about the institution s financial responsibility or capacity  the institution s process or decision to add the new program  or certain other issues 
if the department of education denies approval  the institution may not provide title iv aid to students enrolled in that program 
if the department of education denies approval  the institution may respond to the department s stated reasons for denial and request reconsideration 
the final regulations were generally effective july  according to the department  these notice and application procedures for new programs were intended to remain in place until the department issued a new rule to implement performance based standards for approving new programs using gainful employment measures 
on september  the department of education issued an nprm in which it proposed  among other changes  to define a smaller group of gainful employment programs for which an institution must obtain approval from the department  including only programs that are the same as or substantially similar to programs performing poorly under the gainful employment metrics 
the september nprm also included some additional procedural clarifications 
if our efforts to comply with the new and impending regulations are inconsistent with how the department of education interprets those regulations  either due to insufficient time to implement the necessary changes  uncertainty about the meaning of the rules  or otherwise  we may be found to be in noncompliance with such regulations and the department of education could impose monetary penalties  place limitations on our operations  and or condition or terminate our eligibility to receive title iv program funds 
however  we cannot predict with certainty the effect the new and impending regulatory provisions will have on our business 
on july   apscu filed a lawsuit in the us district court for the district of columbia challenging the department of education october  and june  final regulations on gainful employment 
the lawsuit challenges the reporting and disclosure regulations  the metrics used to calculate gainful employment  and the new program approval regulations 
apscu alleges that the regulations represent overreaching by the department of education  conflict with congressional intent  and were developed through a flawed administrative process that violated the administrative procedure act  the higher education act  and the constitution 
on june   the us district court for the district of columbia struck down the debt measures and certain related requirements  the court ruled one day before the debt measure regulations would have gone into effect 
the court held that the department of education interpreted reasonably its statutory authority when it promulgated the gainful employment regulations but arbitrarily chose the debt repayment rate percentage 
the court ruling did not affect the gainful employment regulations related to certain disclosures to prospective students  such as on time graduation rates and tuition and fees 
the department of education required institutions to make such disclosures by july   and to update such disclosures for the award year by january  on july   the us department of education issued an announcement acknowledging that the court had vacated the debt measures that would have gone into effect on july  the announcement stated that institutions are not required to comply with related regulations addressing reporting requirements and adding new gainful employment programs 
pending a final ruling in this case  the department of education has advised schools to follow the rules on additional programs that immediately preceded the gainful employment rules 
the version once again in effect provides that approval of new programs is not required if the additional program prepares students for gainful employment in the same or related occupation as an educational program that has previously been designated as eligible and is at least eight semester hours  twelve quarter hours  or clock hours 
on july   department of education filed a motion with the us district court for the district of columbia to alter or amend the judgment 
the department of education argued in its motion that even though it would not be permitted to sanction education institutions for failure to meet the debt measure thresholds  i education institutions should disclose information to the department of education that will allow the department of education to calculate the debt measures and ii education institutions should include the results of the debt measure calculations in their disclosures to prospective students 
on september   the us district court for the district of columbia requested a supplemental briefing by the parties addressing  in brief  i the scope of the department of education statutory authorization to maintain a database of information about student borrowers and ii the authority on which the department of education relied to argue that it could require education institutions to provide information to the department of education for purposes of calculating the debt measures and then require education institutions to disclose the results of those debt measure calculations 
the parties filed supplemental briefs in november  and the us district court for the district of columbia is expected to render a decision in the department of education could impose regulations in the future that would penalize us including making us ineligible to receive title iv funds if our students fail to achieve certain debt repayment  debt to income  or debt to discretionary income ratios 
eligibility and certification procedures 
each institution must apply periodically to the department of education for continued certification to participate in title iv programs 
such recertification generally is required every six years  but may be required earlier  including when an institution undergoes a change of control 
an institution may come under the department of education s review when it expands its activities in certain ways  such as opening an additional location  adding a new program  or  in certain cases  when it modifies academic credentials that it offers 
the department of education may place an institution on provisional certification status if it finds that the institution does not fully satisfy all of the eligibility and certification standards and in certain other circumstances  such as when an institution is certified for the first time or undergoes a change in ownership resulting in a change in control 
during the period of provisional certification  the institution must comply with any additional conditions included in its program participation agreement 
in addition  the department of education may more closely review an institution that is provisionally certified if it applies for approval to open a new location  add an educational program  acquire another school or make any other significant change 
if the department of education determines that a provisionally certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program participation agreement  it may seek to revoke the institution s certification to participate in title iv programs with fewer due process protections for the institution than if it were fully certified 
students attending provisionally certified institutions remain eligible to receive title iv program funds 
distance learning 
we offer all of our existing degree  diploma and certificate programs from our headquarters in charles town  west virginia via internet based telecommunications 
under heoa  an accreditor that evaluates institutions offering distance education must require such institutions to have processes through which the institution establishes that a student who registers for a distance education program is the same student who participates in and receives credit for the program 
under the final department of education regulations published on october   if an institution offers postsecondary education through distance education to students in a state in which the institution is not physically located or in which it is otherwise subject to state jurisdiction as determined by the state  the institution must meet any state requirements for it to offer legally postsecondary distance education in that state 
the institution must be able to document state approval for distance education if requested by the department of education 
in addition  states must have a process to review and take appropriate action on complaints concerning postsecondary institutions 
these new rules were to become effective july   although the department of education indicated in an april  guidance letter that it would not initiate any action to establish repayment liabilities or limit student eligibility for distance education activities undertaken before july   provided the institution is making a good faith effort to identify and obtain necessary state authorization before that date 
on july   however  the us district court for the district of columbia vacated the portion of the department of education s state authorization regulation that requires online education providers to obtain any required authorizations from all states in which their students reside  finding that the department of education had failed to provide sufficient notice and opportunity for comment on the requirement 
on june   the us court of appeals for the district of columbia affirmed the district court july  ruling 
on july   the department of education issued a dear colleague letter cautioning education institutions to remain in compliance with all applicable state laws and regulations related to distance education 
the department of education has not announced its next steps  but it may engage in the future in a negotiated rulemaking to address distance education and state authorization 
should the federal distance education requirements published in october be enforced in the future  and if we fail to obtain required state authorization to provide postsecondary distance education in a specific state  we could lose our ability to award title iv aid to students in that state 
administrative capability 
current department of education regulations specify extensive criteria by which an institution must establish that it has the requisite administrative capability to participate in title iv programs 
failure to satisfy any of the standards may lead the department of education to find the institution ineligible to participate in title iv programs or to place the institution on provisional certification as a condition of its participation 
to meet the administrative capability standards  an institution must  among other things comply with all applicable title iv program regulations  have capable and sufficient personnel to administer title iv programs  have acceptable methods of defining and measuring the satisfactory academic progress of its students  not have cohort default rates above specified levels  have various procedures in place for safeguarding federal funds  not be  and not have any principal or affiliate who is  debarred or suspended from federal contracting or engaging in activity that is cause for debarment or suspension  provide financial aid counseling to its students  refer to the department of education s office of inspector general any credible information indicating that any applicant  student  employee or agent of the institution has been engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving title iv programs  submit in a timely manner all reports and financial statements required by the regulations  report annually to the secretary of education on any reasonable reimbursements paid or provided by a private education lender or group of lenders to any employee who is employed in the institution s financial aid office or who otherwise has responsibilities with respect to education loans  develop and apply an adequate system to identify and resolve discrepant information with respect to a student s application for title iv aid  and not otherwise appear to lack administrative capability 
the department of education s final regulations published on october  amend the department s administrative capability standards in two respects 
first  the final rules make a number of changes related to defining and measuring the satisfactory academic progress of students 
among other changes  the new rules require that an institution must evaluate satisfactory academic progress at the end of each payment period if the length of the educational program is one academic year or less or for all other educational programs  at the end of each payment period or at least annually to correspond to the end of a payment period 
second  the new regulations add an administrative capability standard related to the existing requirement that students must have a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent in order to be eligible for title iv aid 
under the new administrative capability standard  institutions must develop and follow procedures for evaluating the validity of a student s high school diploma if the institution or the secretary of education has reason to believe that the student s diploma is not valid 
if an institution fails to satisfy any administrative capability criteria or any other department of education regulation  the department of education may require the repayment of title iv funds  transfer the institution from the advance system of payment of title iv funds to cash monitoring status or to the reimbursement system of payment  place the institution on provisional certification status  or commence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit  suspend  or terminate the participation of the institution in title iv programs 
if we are found not to have satisfied the department of education s administrative capability requirements  we could lose  or be limited in our access to  title iv program funding 
third party servicers 
department of education regulations permit an institution to enter into a written contract with a third party servicer for the administration of any aspect of the institution s participation in title iv programs 
the third party servicer must  among other obligations  comply with title iv requirements and be jointly and severally liable with the institution to the secretary of education for any violation by the servicer of any title iv provision 
an institution must report to the department of education new contracts with or any significant modifications to contracts with third party servicers as well as other matters related to third party servicers 
if any third party servicer that we engage does not comply with applicable statute and regulations including the higher education act  we may be liable for its actions  and we could lose our eligibility to participate in title iv programs 
we recently determined to terminate our relationship with global financial aid services  inc  which had assisted us with administration of our participation in title iv programs since we began to participate in those programs in  and to administer our participation in title iv programs internally  using third party software 
financial responsibility 
the higher education act and department of education regulations establish extensive standards of financial responsibility that institutions such as us must satisfy in order to participate in title iv programs 
these standards generally require that an institution provide the resources necessary to comply with title iv program requirements and meet all of its financial obligations  including required refunds and any repayments to the department of education for liabilities incurred in programs administered by the department of education 
the department of education evaluates institutions on an annual basis for compliance with specified financial responsibility standards 
generally  the standards require an institution to receive an unqualified opinion from its accountants on its audited financial statements  maintain sufficient cash reserves to satisfy refund requirements  meet all of its financial obligations  and remain current on its debt payments 
the financial responsibility standards include a complex formula that uses line items from the institution s audited financial statements 
the formula focuses on three financial ratios equity ratio which measures the institution s capital resources  financial viability  and ability to borrow  primary reserve ratio which measures the institution s viability and liquidity  and net income ratio which measures the institution s profitability or ability to operate within its means 
an institution s financial ratios must yield a composite score of at least for the institution to be deemed financially responsible without the need for further federal oversight 
the department of education may also apply such measures of financial responsibility to the operating company and ownership entities of an eligible institution 
at the request of the department of education  we supply our consolidated financial statements to the department of education for purposes of calculating the composite score 
we have applied the financial responsibility standards to our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december   and calculated a composite score of out of a maximum score of we therefore believe that we meet the department of education s composite score standards 
if the department of education were to determine that we did not meet the financial responsibility standards due to a failure to meet the composite score or other factors  we may be able to establish financial responsibility on an alternative basis by  among other things posting a letter of credit in an amount equal to at least of the total title iv program funds received by us during our most recently completed fiscal year  posting a letter of credit in an amount equal to at least of such prior year s title iv program funds received by us  accepting provisional certification  complying with additional department of education monitoring requirements and agreeing to receive title iv program funds under an arrangement other than the department of education s standard advance payment arrangement such as the reimbursement system of payment or cash monitoring  or complying with additional department of education monitoring requirements and agreeing to receive title iv program funds under an arrangement other than the department of education s standard advance payment arrangement such as the reimbursement system of payment or cash monitoring 
failure to meet the department of education s financial responsibility requirements  because we do not meet the department of education s minimum composite score to establish financial responsibility or are unable to establish financial responsibility on an alternative basis or fail to meet other financial responsibility requirements  would cause us to lose access to title iv program funding 
title iv return of funds 
under the department of education s return of funds regulations  when a student withdraws  an institution must return unearned funds to the department of education in a timely manner 
an institution must first determine the amount of title iv program funds that a student earned 
if the student withdraws during the first of any period of enrollment or payment period  the amount of title iv program funds that the student earned is equal to a pro rata portion of the funds for which the student would otherwise be eligible 
if the student withdraws after the threshold  then the student has earned of the title iv program funds 
the department of education s final regulations published on october  establish several new rules for determining when a student is considered withdrawn 
those rules went into effect july   and the department of education provided interpretive guidance in a july  dear colleague letter 
under the final regulations  an institution generally must treat a student in a module defined as a course or courses that do not span the entire length of the payment period or enrollment period as withdrawn if the student does not complete all the instructional time that the student was scheduled to complete prior to withdrawing 
we offer standard term based modules and therefore must comply with the new rule 
in addition  in certain circumstances  we use a student s last day of attendance at an academically related activity as the student s withdrawal date for title iv purposes 
under the final regulations  institutions that use the last day of attendance at an academically related activity must determine the relevant date based on accurate institutional records not a student s certificate of attendance 
for online classes  academic attendance means engaging in an academically related activity  such as participating in class through an online discussion or initiating contact with a faculty member to ask a question  simply logging into an online class does not constitute academic attendance for purposes of the return of funds requirements 
the institution must return to the appropriate title iv programs  in a specified order  the lesser of i the unearned title iv program funds or ii the institutional charges incurred by the student for the period multiplied by the percentage of unearned title iv program funds 
an institution must return the funds no later than days after the date of the institution s determination that a student withdrew 
if such payments are not timely made  an institution may be subject to adverse action  including being required to submit a letter of credit equal to of the refunds the institution should have made in its most recently completed fiscal year 
under department of education regulations  late returns of title iv program funds for or more of students sampled in the institution s annual compliance audit constitutes material noncompliance 
the rule 
a requirement of the higher education act  commonly referred to as the rule  applies only to proprietary institutions of higher education  which includes us 
as discussed above  under the higher education act  a proprietary institution is prohibited from deriving from title iv funds  on a cash accounting basis except for certain institutional loans for any fiscal year  more than of its revenues as computed for rule purposes 
prior to the adoption of heoa  an institution that violated the rule became ineligible to participate in title iv programs as of the first day of the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which its title iv revenue exceeded of its revenues  and it was unable to apply to regain its eligibility until the next fiscal year 
heoa changed the rule from an eligibility requirement to a compliance obligation that is part of an institution s program participation agreement with the department of education 
accordingly  heoa generally lessens the severity of noncompliance with the rule  although repeated noncompliance will result in loss of eligibility to participate in title iv programs 
under the terms of heoa  a proprietary institution of higher education that violates the rule for any fiscal year will be placed on provisional status for two fiscal years 
proprietary institutions of higher education that violate the rule for two consecutive fiscal years will become ineligible to participate in title iv programs for at least two fiscal years and will be required to demonstrate compliance with title iv eligibility and certification requirements for at least two fiscal years prior to resuming title iv program participation 
heoa requires the secretary of education to disclose on its website any proprietary institution of higher education that fails to meet the requirement and to report annually to congress the relevant ratios for each proprietary institution of higher education 
heoa generally codifies the formula for rule calculations as set forth in preceding department of education regulations  but also expands on the department of education s formula in certain respects  including by broadening the categories of funds that may be counted as non title iv revenue for rule purposes 
heoa s changes to the rule took effect upon enactment  which occurred on august  the department of education issued final regulations implementing the rule and certain other heoa provisions on october  the final regulations were effective july  the regulations generally track the heoa provisions  but clarify the treatment of certain types of revenue 
the regulations require institutions to report in their annual financial statement audits not only the percentage of revenues derived from title iv funds during the fiscal year  but also the dollar amount of the numerator and denominator of the calculation and specified categories of revenue 
the regulations shorten from to days the time period within which institutions must notify the secretary of education after the end of a fiscal year in which the institution failed to meet the requirement 
using the formula in effect prior to enactment of heoa  we derived approximately of our cash basis revenues from eligible programs in compared to in and in using the heoa formula  we derived approximately  and of our cash basis revenues from title iv program funds in  and  respectively 
our percentage of cash based revenues from title iv program funds has increased as our population of students using title iv program funds has increased 
the population of our students using these funds is growing at a faster rate than students who use other sources of revenues  and we will continue to monitor compliance with the rule 
in addition  certain members of congress have stated that congress should revise the rule to count dod tuition assistance and veterans education benefits toward the limit 
for example  members of congress raised this idea both in the september hearing before the house armed services committee s subcommittee on oversight and investigations reviewing dod s oversight of distance education and for profit institutions and in a december help committee report examining the growing share of dod tuition assistance and post gi bill benefits flowing to for profit institutions 
because we receive a substantial portion of our revenues from dod tuition assistance and veterans educational benefits  such a change would significantly increase our risk of violating the rule 
in january  senators harkin and durbin introduced a bill to modify the rule by reducing the threshold to and counting the title iv programs  the dod tuition assistance program  and veterans education benefits programs as sources from which an institution may derive no more than of its revenue 
in february  companion bills were introduced in the us senate and us house of representatives that would modify the rule to count dod tuition assistance and veterans education benefits toward the limit  along with title iv programs 
on may   attorneys general for states called on congress to enact this type of legislation 
we cannot predict the likelihood that congress will amend the rule to count dod tuition assistance and veterans education benefits toward the limit or to lower the ratio to if the calculation for purposes of the rule is changed so that dod tuition assistance and or veterans education benefits are counted toward a or limit  our percentage of revenues that would count toward such limit would be significantly higher than our current calculation 
we are not required to include all federal funding in our calculation and do not track sources of funds for this purpose 
accordingly  we cannot estimate with precision what our percentage would be if any of these proposed amendments to the rule are made by congress 
however  based on our assessment of net course registrations  we currently estimate that approximately of our funding is derived from federal sources 
student loan defaults 
under the higher education act  an educational institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all of the title iv programs if defaults on the repayment of ffel program or direct loan program loans by its students exceed certain levels 
for each federal fiscal year  a rate of student defaults known as a cohort default rate is calculated for each institution with or more borrowers entering repayment in a given federal fiscal year by determining the rate at which borrowers who become subject to their repayment obligation in that federal fiscal year default by the end of the next federal fiscal year 
for such institutions  the department of education calculates a single cohort default rate for each federal fiscal year that includes in the cohort all current or former student borrowers at the institution who entered repayment on any ffel program or direct loan program loan during that year 
such rate is referred to as the two year cohort default rate 
if the department of education notifies an institution that its two year cohort default rates for each of the three most recent federal fiscal years are or greater  the institution s participation in the ffel program  direct loan program  and pell program ends days after the notification  unless the institution timely appeals that determination on specified grounds and according to specified procedures 
in addition  an institution s participation in the ffel program and direct loan program ends days after notification that its most recent two year cohort default rate is greater than  unless the institution timely appeals that determination on specified grounds and according to specified procedures 
an institution whose participation ends under these provisions may not participate in the relevant programs for the remainder of the fiscal year in which the institution receives the notification  as well as for the next two fiscal years 
if an institution s two year cohort default rate equals or exceeds in any single year  the institution may be placed on provisional certification status 
provisional certification does not limit an institution s access to title iv program funds  however  an institution with provisional status is subject to closer review by the department of education and may be subject to summary adverse action if it violates title iv program requirements 
the three most recent federal fiscal years for which ffel direct loan cohort defaults rates have been officially calculated are federal fiscal years   and because we began only recently to enroll students who are participating in the federal student loan programs  we have no historical cohort default rate for federal fiscal year our cohort default rate for federal fiscal years  and  respectively  is  and 
relatively few students are expected to enter the repayment repayment phase in the near term  which could result in defaults by a few students having a relatively large impact on our cohort default rate 
heoa extends by one year the period for measuring the cohort default rate for ffel program and direct loan program loans 
beginning with cohort default rate calculations for federal fiscal year  the cohort default rate will be calculated by determining the rate at which borrowers who become subject to their repayment obligation in the relevant federal fiscal year default by the end of the second following federal fiscal year 
such rate is referred to as the three year cohort default rate 
the current method of calculating rates will remain in effect and will be used to determine any sanctions on institutions because of their cohort default rates  namely the two year cohort default rate  until three consecutive years of official cohort default rates calculated under the new formula are available ie  in the heoa also increases the cohort default rate ceiling from to 
the heoa provides for the following sanctions based on cohort default rates calculated under the new heoa methodology an institution whose three year cohort default rate is equal to or greater than for each of the three most recent federal fiscal years for which data are available will be ineligible to participate in the ffel program  direct loan program  and federal pell grant program 
if an institution s three year cohort default rate is or more in a given fiscal year  the institution will be required to assemble a default prevention task force and submit to the department of education a default improvement plan 
an institution whose three year cohort default rate exceeds for two consecutive years will be required to review  revise  and resubmit its default improvement plan  and the department of education may direct that such plan be amended to include actions  with measurable objectives  that it determines will promote loan repayment 
the department of education may subject an institution to provisional certification if the institution s three year cohort default rate is or more for any two consecutive federal fiscal years 
an institution whose three year cohort default rate is or more for any two consecutive federal fiscal years may file an appeal on specified grounds and according to specified procedures  and if the secretary of education determines that the institution has demonstrated grounds for relief  the secretary may not subject the institution to provisional certification based solely on the institution s cohort default rate 
heoa does not change the current provision that an institution generally loses eligibility to participate in the ffel program and the direct loan program if its most recent cohort default rate is greater than 
in october  the department of education issued final regulations to implement the heoa provisions on cohort default rates and other student loan matters 
those regulations became effective july  the final regulations provide that the department of education will issue two cohort default rates a rate calculated in accordance with pre heoa methodology two year rate and a rate calculated in accordance with heoa methodology three year rate for fiscal years through the final regulations also indicate that the department of education will rely on the two year rate and related thresholds to determine institutional eligibility until  when the department of education issues official three year rates for the federal fiscal year cohort 
in december  the department of education sent to institutions unofficial  trial cohort default rates showing institutions cohort default rates for federal fiscal years   and as they would be calculated under the heoa methodology 
three year cohort default rates were generally expected to be higher than two year cohort default rates  because of both the longer repayment history and current economic conditions 
our trial three year cohort default rates are   and for federal fiscal years   and  respectively 
in february  the department of education published trial three year cohort default rates for fiscal year our trial cohort default rate for federal fiscal year was 
in april  the department of education issued corrected trial cohort default rates for our corrected rate was 
our official three year cohort default rate for is 
incentive payment rules 
as part of an institution s program participation agreement with the department of education and in accordance with the higher education act  an institution may not provide any commission  bonus or other incentive payment to any person or entity engaged in any student recruitment  admissions  or financial aid awarding activity based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid 
failure to comply with the incentive payment rule could result in termination of participation in title iv programs  limitation on participation in title iv programs  or financial penalties 
in  the department of education promulgated safe harbors setting forth certain permissible activities and arrangements under the incentive payment regulation 
the final regulations published on october  abolished the safe harbors and modified the regulation to codify a stricter reading of the incentive payment provision 
the final rule became effective july  in march  the department of education issued guidance on the revised incentive payment regulation 
certain ambiguities in the final rule and the department of education s accompanying statements and march guidance create uncertainty as to how the revised rule will be interpreted and enforced by the department of education 
on june   the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit held that the elimination of the safe harbor for compensation based upon students successfully completing their educational programs  or one academic year of their educational programs was arbitrary and capricious 
the court remanded for the department of education to provide further explanation for the elimination 
in addition  the court required the department of education to address comments on the regulations  raised during the comment period  that the compensation regulations may have an adverse effect on minority enrollment 
we believe that our current employee compensation and third party contractual arrangements comply with the incentive payment provisions of the higher education act and department of education regulations currently in effect however  in light of the uncertainties surrounding the revised rule and ambiguities in the department of education s related guidance  or otherwise  we can make no assurances that the department would not find deficiencies in our current or future employee compensation plans contractual arrangements 
similarly  there can be no assurance that the department of education would not find deficiencies in our former and contractual arrangements 
in addition  in recent years  other postsecondary educational institutions have been named as defendants to whistleblower lawsuits  known as qui tam cases  brought by current or former employees pursuant to the federal false claims act  alleging that their institution s compensation practices did not comply with the incentive compensation rule 
a qui tam case is a civil lawsuit brought by one or more individuals  referred to as a relator  on behalf of the federal government for an alleged submission to the government of a false claim for payment 
the relator  often a current or former employee  is entitled to a share of the government s recovery in the case  including the possibility of treble damages 
a qui tam action is always filed under seal and remains under seal until the government decides whether to intervene in the case 
if the government intervenes  it takes over primary control of the litigation 
if the government declines to intervene in the case  the relator may nonetheless elect to continue to pursue the litigation at his or her own expense on behalf of the government 
any such litigation could be costly and could divert management s time and attention away from the business  regardless of whether a claim has merit 
in october  the gao released a report entitled higher education stronger federal oversight needed to enforce ban on incentive payments to school recruiters finding that the department of education has inadequately enforced the current ban on incentive payments 
in response  the department has undertaken to increase its enforcement efforts by  among other approaches  strengthening procedures provided to auditors reviewing institutions for compliance with the incentive payments ban and updating its internal compliance guidance in light of the gao findings and the revised incentive payment rule that took effect july  code of conduct related to student loans 
as part of an institution s program participation agreement with the department of education  heoa requires that institutions that participate in title iv programs adopt a code of conduct pertinent to student loans 
for financial aid office or other employees who have responsibility related to education loans  the code must forbid  with limited exceptions  gifts  consulting arrangements with lenders  and advisory board compensation other than reasonable expense reimbursement 
the code also must ban revenue sharing arrangements  opportunity pools that lenders offer in exchange for certain promises  and staffing assistance from lenders 
the institution must post the code prominently on its website and ensure that its officers  employees  and agents who have financial aid responsibilities are informed annually of the code s provisions 
in addition to the code of conduct requirements that apply to institutions  heoa contains provisions that apply to private lenders  prohibiting such lenders from engaging in certain activities as they interact with institutions 
failure to comply with the code of conduct provision could result in termination of our participation in title iv programs  limitations on participation in title iv programs  or financial penalties 
misrepresentation 
the higher education act and current regulations authorize the department of education to take action against an institution that participates in title iv programs for any substantial misrepresentation made by that institution regarding the nature of its educational program  its financial charges  or the employability of its graduates 
effective july   the final regulations published on october  expand the definition of substantial misrepresentation to cover additional representatives of the institution and additional substantive areas and expands the parties to whom a substantial misrepresentation cannot be made 
the regulations also augment the actions the department of education may take if it determines that an institution has engaged in substantial misrepresentation 
under the final regulations  the department of education may revoke an institution s program participation agreement  impose limitations on an institution s participation in title iv programs  or initiate proceedings to impose a fine or to limit  suspend  or terminate the institution s participation in title iv programs 
on june   the us court of appeals for the district of columbia vacated portions of the substantial misrepresentation regulation that permitted the us department of education to i revoke an institution program participation agreement or impose limitations on an institution participation without affording procedural protections  ii proscribe misrepresentations with respect to subjects not covered by the higher education act  and iii proscribe statements that are merely confusing 
the court remanded the matters so that the department of education can revise the regulations 
the department of education could promulgate regulations that expand its role in monitoring and enforcing prohibitions on misrepresentation 
credit hours 
the higher education act and current regulations use the term credit hour to define an eligible program and an academic year and to determine enrollment status and the amount of title iv aid an institution may disburse during a payment period 
recently  both congress and the department of education have increased their focus on institutions policies for awarding credit hours 
as discussed above  in june  a house education and labor committee hearing examined accrediting agencies standards for assessing institutions credit hour policies 
the final regulations published on october  define the previously undefined term credit hour in terms of a certain amount of time in class and outside class  or an equivalent amount of work 
the regulations also require accrediting agencies to review the reliability and accuracy of an institution s credit hour assignments 
if an accreditor identifies systematic or significant noncompliance in one or more of an institution s programs  the accreditor must notify the secretary of education 
as of july   if the department of education determines that an institution is out of compliance with the credit hour definition  the department could require the institution to repay the incorrectly awarded amounts of title iv aid 
in addition  if the department determines that an institution has significantly overstated the amount of credit hours assigned to a program  the department may fine the institution  or limit  suspend  or terminate its participation in the title iv programs 
college affordability and transparency lists 
under heoa  the department of education has published on its website lists of the top of institutions  in each of nine categories  with the highest tuition and fees for the most recent academic year  the highest net price for the most recent academic year  the largest percentage increase in tuition and fees for the most recent three academic years  and the largest percentage increase in net price for the most recent three academic years 
an institution that is placed on a list for high percentage increases in either tuition and fees or in net price must submit a report to the department of education explaining the increases and the steps that it intends to take to reduce costs 
the department of education will report annually to congress on these institutions and will publish their reports on its web site 
the department of education also posts lists of the top of institutions in each of the nine categories with lowest tuition and fees or the lowest net price for the most recent academic year 
under heoa  net price means average yearly price actually charged to first time  full time undergraduate students who receive student aid at a higher education institution after such aid is deducted 
currently  we are listed as the institution with the lowest tuition among private for profit  four year or above institutions 
we are also listed as the institution with the eighth lowest net price among private for profit  four year or above institutions 
we cannot predict with certainty the effect such lists will have on our operations 
compliance reviews 
we are subject to announced and unannounced compliance reviews and audits by various external agencies  including the department of education  oig  state licensing agencies  agencies that guarantee ffel program loans  the department of veterans affairs  and accrediting agencies 
as part of the department of education s ongoing monitoring of institutions administration of title iv programs  the higher education act and department of education regulations also require institutions to submit annually a compliance audit conducted by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with government auditing standards and applicable audit standards of the department of education 
in addition  to enable the secretary of education to make a determination of financial responsibility  institutions must annually submit audited financial statements prepared in accordance with department of education regulations 
in august  the secretary of education sent a letter to several members of the senate help committee responding to the findings of the gao s undercover investigation 
the secretary explained that the department of education plans to strengthen its oversight of title iv programs through  among other approaches  increasing the number of program reviews by  from conducted in up to reviews in on february  the us department of education began an on site program review of apus administration of the title iv programs 
in general  after the department of education conducts its site visit and reviews data supplied by the institution  the department of education sends the institution a program review report 
the institution has the opportunity to respond to the findings in the program review report 
the department of education then issues a final program review determination letter  which identifies any liabilities 
the institution may appeal any monetary liabilities specified in the final program review determination letter 
the site visit for our program review  which covered the and award years  took place from february  through march  apus received the program review report in april the report included three findings  two of which involve individual student specific errors 
the third finding was that apus policies failed to treat certain students as having unofficially withdrawn from the institution and that the university consequently failed to calculate and return federal student financial aid that apus was required to return to the department of education as the result of these unofficial withdrawals 
the department position is that students who did not earn an f grade in a payment period should be treated as having unofficially withdrawn from the school  even if they had future course registrations in the next payment period 
we disagree with this interpretation of department of education regulations  and apus filed a response to the department of education in june and responded to follow up requests from the department of education 
on may  the department of education issued a final program review determination  or fprd 
the fprd identified liabilities resulting from the program review report findings  provided instructions for payment of the liabilities to the department of education  notified apus of its right to appeal  and notified apus that under department of education regulations  apus was required to post an irrevocable letter of credit payable to the us secretary of education due to the number of unpaid and late refunds identified as part of the program review 
the liabilities and letter of credit requirements are based on the program review report finding that apus policies improperly failed to treat certain students as having unofficially withdrawn from the institution and that apus consequently failed to calculate and return federal student financial aid to the department of education as a result of these unofficial withdrawals 
the fprd stated that apus total monetary liability  including interest  was  notwithstanding that the company disagreed with the department position  after considering the time  effort  expense and other factors involved in a full appeal  the company determined to pay the liability 
after paying a portion of the liability  apus timely appealed the remaining amount because it discovered discrepancies in the department of education records as compared to its records for certain students at issue in the fprd 
by letter dated july   the department of education withdrew the fprd without prejudice and indicated its intent to reissue a revised fprd at a later date 
apus subsequently received a revised fprd letter dated august  the august fprd letter was substantially similar to the may fprd letter but it provided for a reduced liability amount 
the total liability amount in the may fprd letter was  the total liability amount in the august fprd letter was  by the time of the august fprd letter  apus had already paid  based on the may fprd 
in addition  the company accrued  at june  for interest expense related to the fprd 
apus determined that it would not appeal the august fprd letter  and in a courtesy letter to department of education it undertook to pay the remaining amount due as specified in the fprd 
because we cannot be assured that we will be able to collect the full amounts from the relevant former students  we have established a reserve against these receivables 
we will continue to monitor the collection history and the reserve established 
in response to the fprd  we have also posted an irrevocable letter of credit in favor of the department of education in the amount of  privacy 
the family educational rights and privacy act of  or ferpa  and the department of education s ferpa regulations require institutions to allow students to review and request changes to such student s education records maintained by the institution  notify students at least annually of this inspection right  and maintain records in each student s file listing requests for access to and disclosures of personally identifiable information and the interest of such party in the student s personally identifiable information 
ferpa also limits the disclosure of a student s personally identifiable information by an institution without such student s prior written consent 
if an institution fails to comply with ferpa or the department of education s ferpa regulations  the department of education may require corrective actions by the institution  withhold further payments under any applicable title iv program or terminate an institution s eligibility to participate in title iv programs 
in addition  an institution participating in any title iv program is obligated to safeguard customer information pursuant to applicable provisions of the gramm leach bliley act  or glba  and federal trade commission  or ftc  regulations 
glba and ftc regulations require an institution to develop and maintain a comprehensive information security program to protect personally identifiable financial information of students  parents or other individuals with whom an institution has a customer relationship 
if an institution fails to comply with glba or ftc regulations  it may be required to take corrective actions  be subject to ftc monitoring and oversight  and be subject to fines or penalties imposed by the ftc 
potential effect of regulatory violations 
if we fail to comply with the regulatory standards governing title iv programs  the department of education could impose one or more sanctions  including transferring us to the reimbursement or cash monitoring system of payment  seeking to require repayment of certain title iv program funds  requiring us to post a letter of credit in favor of the department of education as a condition for continued title iv certification  taking emergency action against us  referring the matter for criminal prosecution or initiating proceedings to impose a fine or to limit  condition  suspend  or terminate our participation in title iv programs 
if such sanctions or proceedings were imposed against us and resulted in a substantial curtailment  or termination  of our participation in title iv programs  our enrollments  revenues  and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
if we lost our eligibility to participate in title iv programs  or if congress reduced the amount of available federal student financial aid  we would seek to arrange or provide alternative sources of revenue or financial aid for students 
although we believe that one or more private organizations would be willing to provide financial assistance to students attending our universities  there is no assurance that this would be the case  and the interest rate and other terms of such financial aid might not be as favorable as those for title iv program funds 
we may be required to guarantee all or part of such alternative assistance or might incur other additional costs in connection with securing alternative sources of financial aid 
accordingly  the loss of our eligibility to participate in title iv programs  or a reduction in the amount of available federal student financial aid  would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our growth plans and results of operations even if we could arrange or provide alternative sources of revenue or student financial aid 
in addition to the actions that may be brought against us as a result of our participation in title iv  we also may be subject  from time to time  to complaints and lawsuits relating to regulatory compliance brought not only by our regulatory agencies  but also by other government agencies and third parties  such as present or former students or employees and other members of the public 
regulatory actions and restrictions on operations many actions that we may wish to take in connection with our operations are also subject to regulation from a variety of agencies 
restrictions on adding educational programs 
state requirements and accrediting agency standards may  in certain instances  limit our ability to establish additional programs 
many states require approval before institutions can add new programs under specified conditions 
the higher learning commission and the west virginia higher education policy commission generally require institutions to notify them in advance of implementing new programs  and upon notification  may undertake a review of the institution s licensure  authorization  or accreditation 
the higher education act and department of education regulations require a proprietary institution of higher education to have been in existence for at least two years in order to be eligible to participate in title iv programs 
an institution subject to the two year rule may not award title iv funds to a student in a program that is not included in the institution s approval documents 
during the institution s initial period of participation in title iv programs  the department of education will not approve additional programs that would expand the scope of the institution s eligibility 
in addition  when an institution is certified for the first time  its certification is provisional until the department of education has reviewed a compliance audit that covers a complete fiscal year of title iv program participation and has decided to certify fully the institution 
in the first quarter of  we timely filed a recertification application because our initial period of certification was scheduled to end on june  as part of that recertification process  the department of education fully certified us  and it no longer considers us to be in our initial period of certification 
however  in august  we were deemed to have undergone a change in ownership and control requiring review by the department of education in order to reestablish our eligibility and continue participation in title iv programs 
on october   the department of education approved our change in ownership application and granted us provisional certification for a two year period ending september  during that period  our program participation agreement provided that  as a provisionally certified institution  we had to apply for and receive approval by the secretary of education for any substantial change 
under our program participation agreement  substantial changes included but were not limited to establishment of additional locations  an increase in the level of academic offering  and addition of any non degree or short term training program 
the department of education advised us that an institution that is provisionally certified based on a change in ownership and control that resulted from a reduction of ownership interest is able to add new degree programs under the same conditions that apply to a fully certified institution 
on july   we received a letter from the department of education notifying us that we are fully recertified to participate in title iv programs through december   and that we are no longer provisionally certified 
generally  under regulations in effect prior to july   if an institution that was not subject to the two year rule or was not in its initial period of certification added an educational program after it had been designated as an eligible institution  the institution was required to apply to the department of education to have the additional program designated as eligible 
however  a fully certified degree granting institution was not obligated to obtain the department of education s approval of additional programs that led to an associate  bachelor s  professional  or graduate degree at the same degree level s previously approved by the department of education 
similarly  a fully certified institution was not required to obtain advance approval for new programs that both prepared students for gainful employment in the same or related recognized occupation as an educational program that had previously been designated as an eligible program at that institution and met certain minimum length requirements 
however  the department of education  as a condition of certification to participate in title iv programs  could require prior approval of such programs or otherwise restrict the number of programs an institution may add 
in the event that an institution that was required to obtain the department of education s express approval for the addition of a new program failed to do so  and erroneously determined that the new educational program was eligible for title iv program funds  the institution could be liable for repayment of title iv program funds received by the institution or students in connection with that program 
the final regulations published on october  establish a new process under which an institution must apply for approval to offer a program that  under the higher education act  prepares students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation in order to be eligible for title iv funds 
effective july   an institution must notify the department of education at least days before the first day of classes when it intends to add a program that prepares students for gainful employment 
on september   the department of education issued an nprm proposing a streamlined approval process that targets only the worst performing programs  specifically programs that are the same or substantially similar to previous programs that failed gainful employment metric s 
on june   the us district court for the district of columbia struck down the gainful employment metrics and regulations related to notifying and potentially obtaining approval from ed for new programs 
pending a final ruling in this case  the department of education has advised schools to follow the rules on additional programs that immediately preceded the gainful employment rules 
for more information about the gainful employment regulations  see above regulation of title iv financial aid programs gainful employment 
the department of education may still  as a condition of certification to participate in title iv programs  require prior approval of programs or otherwise restrict the number of programs an institution may add 
change in ownership resulting in a change of control 
many states and accrediting agencies require institutions of higher education to report or obtain approval of certain changes in ownership or other aspects of institutional status  but the types of and triggers for such reporting or approval vary among states and accrediting agencies 
in addition  our accrediting agencies  the higher learning commission  requires institutions that it accredits to inform it in advance of any substantive change  including a change that significantly alters the ownership or control of the institution 
examples of substantive changes requiring advance notice to the higher learning commission include changes in the legal status  ownership  or form of control of the institution  such as the sale of a proprietary institution 
also  the higher learning commission must approve a substantive change in advance in order to include the change in the institution s accreditation status 
in addition  the higher learning commission also requires an on site evaluation within six months to confirm the appropriateness of the approval 
in june and february  the higher learning commission adopted and revised  respectively  new policies related to institutional control  structure  and organization 
part of the higher learning commission s stated rationale for these changes was to better define the range of its oversight of transactions related to change of ownership at institutions 
the new policies extend the higher learning commission s oversight to transactions that change  or have the potential to change  the control of an institution or its fundamental structure and organization 
under the new policies  the higher learning commission also now extends its oversight to defined changes that occur in a parent or controlling entity  and not necessarily in the institution itself 
actions by  or relating to  an accredited institution  including a significant acquisition of another institution  significant changes in board composition or organizational documents  and accumulations by one stockholder of greater than of the capital stock  could open up an accredited institution to additional reviews by the higher learning commission and possible change from an accredited status to candidate status  which enhances the risks associated with these types of actions 
in particular  the change from accredited status to candidate status could adversely impact an institution s ability to participate in title iv programs 
for profit institutions may also be less attractive acquisition candidates because of the enhanced scrutiny of change in control transactions  the explicit ability to move an institution from accredited status to candidate status  and because the higher learning commission will now also be looking more closely at entities that own accredited institutions 
the higher education act provides that an institution that undergoes a change in ownership resulting in a change in control loses its eligibility to participate in title iv programs and must apply to the department of education in order to reestablish such eligibility 
an institution is ineligible to receive title iv program funds during the period prior to recertification 
the higher education act provides that the department of education may temporarily provisionally certify an institution seeking approval of a change in ownership and control based on preliminary review by the department of education of a materially complete application received by the department of education within business days after the transaction 
the department of education may continue such temporary  provisional certification on a month to month basis until it has rendered a final decision on the institution s application 
if the department of education determines to approve the application after a change in ownership and control  it issues a provisional certification  which extends for a period expiring not later than the end of the third complete award year following the date of provisional certification 
department of education regulations describe some transactions that constitute a change of control  including the transfer of a controlling interest in the voting stock of an institution or the institution s parent corporation 
department of education regulations provide that a change of control of a publicly traded corporation occurs in one of two ways i if there is an event that would obligate the corporation to file a current report on form k with the sec disclosing a change of control or ii if the corporation has a stockholder that owns at least of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation and is the largest stockholder of the corporation  and that stockholder ceases to own at least of such stock or ceases to be the largest stockholder 
a significant purchase or disposition of our voting stock could be determined by the department of education to be a change in ownership and control under this standard 
when a change of ownership resulting in a change of control occurs  the department of education applies a different set of financial tests to determine the financial responsibility of the institution in conjunction with its review and approval of the change of ownership 
the institution generally is required to submit a same day audited balance sheet reflecting the financial condition of the institution immediately following the change in ownership 
the institution s same day balance sheet must demonstrate an acid test ratio of at least  which is calculated by adding cash and cash equivalents to current accounts receivable and dividing the sum by total current liabilities and excluding all unsecured or uncollateralized related party receivables 
the same day balance sheet must demonstrate positive tangible net worth 
when a publicly traded company undergoes a change in ownership and control due to a reduction in ownership interest  as occurred when in august funds affiliated with abs capital partners distributed shares of our stock to its general and limited partners  the institution may submit its most recent quarterly financial statement as filed with the sec  along with copies of all other sec filings made after the close of the fiscal year for which a compliance audit has been submitted to the department of education  instead of the same day balance sheet 
in addition  when a change in ownership and control occurs and there is a new owner  the institution must submit to the department of education audited financial statements of the institution s new owner s two most recently completed fiscal years that are prepared and audited in accordance with department of education requirements 
the department may determine whether the financial statements meet financial responsibility standards with respect to the composite score formula 
if the institution does not satisfy these requirements  the department of education may condition its approval of the change of ownership on the institution s agreeing to letters of credit  provisional certification  and or additional monitoring requirements  as described in the above section on financial responsibility 
if the new owner does not have the required audited financial statements  the department of education may impose certain restrictions on the institution  including with respect to adding locations and programs 
in august  funds affiliated with abs capital partners reduced their beneficial ownership interest from approximately to approximately of our outstanding common stock  and we were deemed to have undergone a change in ownership and control requiring review by the department of education in order to reestablish our eligibility and continue participation in title iv programs 
as required under department of education regulations  we timely notified the department of education of our change in ownership and control 
in connection with the department of education s review of the change  we submitted to the department of education a change in ownership application that included the submission of required documentation  including a letter from the higher learning commission indicating that it had approved the change 
on october   we received a letter from the department of education approving the change in ownership and control and granting us provisional certification until september  on july   we received a letter from the department of education notifying us that we are fully recertified to participate in title iv programs through december  many states include the sale of a controlling interest of common stock in the definition of a change of control requiring approval 
a change of control under the definitions of an agency that regulates us might require us to obtain approval of the change in ownership and control in order to maintain our regulatory approval 
under certain circumstances  the west virginia higher education policy commission and the state council of higher education for virginia might require us to seek approval of changes in ownership and control in order to maintain our state authorization or licensure 
with respect to the distribution by the funds affiliated with abs capital partners  the state council of higher education for virginia did not consider the distribution to be a change in ownership under its regulations  and the west virginia higher education policy commission approved the change 
pursuant to federal law providing benefits for veterans and reservists  we are approved for education of veterans and members of the selective reserve and their dependents by the state approving agencies in west virginia and virginia 
in certain circumstances  state approving agencies may require an institution to obtain approval for a change in ownership and control 
a change of control could occur as a result of future transactions in which we are involved 
some corporate reorganizations and some changes in the board of directors are examples of such transactions 
moreover  as a publicly traded company  the potential adverse effects of a change of control could influence future decisions by us and our stockholders regarding the sale  purchase  transfer  issuance  or redemption of our stock 
in addition  the regulatory burdens and risks associated with a change of control also could discourage bids for your shares of common stock and could have an adverse effect on the market price of your shares 
pending regulatory changes negotiated rulemaking 
on may   the department of education announced its intention to establish additional negotiated rulemaking committees to prepare proposed regulations under the higher education act 
three public hearings were conducted in may at which interested parties suggested issues that should be considered for action by the negotiating committees 
the department of education also conducted roundtable discussions to inform policy in the areas of teacher preparation  college completion  and the proposed first in the world competition 
in spring  the department of education convened two negotiated rulemaking committees one on teacher preparation and one on student loans that each held a series of meetings to discuss proposed changes to applicable regulations 
negotiators reached consensus on proposed regulatory language on student loan issues  which will result in two packages of proposed rules to be published for public comment before final promulgation 
proposed rules relating to various loan repayment issues  including a new income based repayment plan for the direct loan program  were issued november  although the rule was originally scheduled to become effective on july   the department of education announced the rule would go into effect on december  also  the department of education issued a nprm on july  addressing discharges of loans for borrowers who suffer from total and permanent disability  and the department of education promulgated final rules on november  proposed rules relating to other loan issues are expected in  to be effective in negotiators failed to reach consensus on proposed regulations related to teacher preparation programs and the awarding of teach grants 
the committee disagreed about how  if at all  students test scores should be used to judge the effectiveness of their teacher preparation program 
such so called value added scores were promoted by the department of education during the negotiations as one way to determine which institutions should be eligible to award teach grants to students in their teacher preparation programs 
as the negotiators failed to reach consensus  the department of education is now responsible for drafting proposed regulations  to be released at a future date 
apus offers a state approved educator certification program in west virginia and would therefore be subject to any regulations that may be promulgated 
on april   the department of education announced that it would be publishing a notice regarding its intent to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee to prepare proposed regulations for the title iv programs 
the announcement states that the department of education intends to develop proposed regulations designed to prevent fraud and otherwise ensure proper use of title iv program funds  and to improve and streamline the campus based title iv programs 
the announcement states that the department of education is considering regulatory changes related to the disbursement of title iv program funds  particularly electronic funds transfers made directly to a student bank account and available to the student via debit or another bank provided card 
the department of education held two public hearings in may negotiations were expected to begin in but to date the department of education has not announced negotiated rulemaking teams or a negotiated rulemaking schedule 
executive order on military and veterans benefits programs 
on april   president obama issued an executive order  which we refer to as the eo  that directs the departments of defense  veterans affairs  and education to establish principles of excellence to strengthen oversight  enforcement  and accountability  which we refer to as the principles  in connection with the post gi bill and the department of defense tuition assistance program 
the eo requires the principles to apply to all education institutions that receive funding from military and veterans education benefits programs  and it does not distinguish among not for profit  public  and for profit institutions 
the principles include  for example  disclosure obligations related to program costs  student aid eligibility  estimated loan debt  student outcomes  and education plans and a prohibition on fraudulent and aggressive recruiting techniques on and off military installations 
the agencies must implement the principles through various actions  and within days after the date of the eo they must report to the president their progress  including in terms of revisions to regulations  guidance documents  memoranda of understanding  and other policies related to the post gi bill and dod tuition assistance 
in addition  among other action  the departments of defense  veterans affairs  and education are directed to develop a comprehensive strategy to establish service member and veteran student outcome measures that are comparable  to the maximum extent practicable  across military and veterans education benefit programs  and the department of education must collect from institutions and publish information on the amount of funding institutions receive from the post gi bill and the department of defense tuition assistance program 
the eo also contains requirements related to enforcement of and compliance related to the principles  including  for example  development of complaint systems and establishment of procedures for program reviews 
because a significant portion of our students use funding from military and veterans benefits programs  any actions that these agencies take could have a significant impact on our business 
the department of veterans affairs requested that each education institution state  by electronic mail sent by august   its intent to comply with the principles 
we notified the department of veterans affairs that apus intends to make a good faith effort to comply with the eo  subject to clarifying guidance and interpretation by the departments of defense  veteran affairs and education and or the consumer financial protection bureau 
on july   the department of education issued guidance on each principle meaning 
the eo requires the secretaries of defense and veterans affairs  in consultation with the secretary of education and the director of the consumer financial protection bureau  to submit a plan to strengthen enforcement and compliance related to the principles before the end of july such plan has not been published 
we do not know what further actions the departments of defense  veterans affairs  and education will take to implement the principles 
consumer financial protection bureau 
on august   the consumer financial protection bureau  or cfpb  submitted a report to the senate committee on banking  housing  and urban affairs  the senate help committee  the house of representatives committee on financial services  and the house of representatives committee on education and the workforce entitled private student loans 
the report contained specific suggestions for congressional action to restructure the student lending experience  including possibly requiring institutions to certify that a student is not eligible for any further federal funds before a private loan may be issued to such student 
on october   the consumer financial protection bureau ombudsman for private student loan matters issued a report containing recommendations for the senate committee on banking  housing  and urban affairs  the senate help committee  the house committee on financial services  the house committee on education and the workforce  the secretary of the treasury  the director of the consumer financial protection bureau  and the secretary of education 
the report addressed potential reforms to student loan servicing and expansion of loan modification and refinancing options 
in addition  on october  the consumer financial protection bureau released a report entitled the next front student loan servicing and the cost to our men and women in uniform 
the report details the challenges that some service members have encountered when utilizing private and federal student loans 
we do not know what steps may be taken by congress or federal agencies in response to this report  or the report of the majority staff of the help committee  and whether such actions if any will have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
also  on january   cfpb encouraged institutions of higher education  students  and others to provide information to the cfpb by march  about the financial products and services currently offered to students  and comments on how current and future arrangements between institutions of higher education and financial institutions could be structured in order to promote positive financial decision making among consumers 
item a 
risk factors investing in our common stock has a high degree of risk 
before making an investment in our common stock  you should carefully consider the following risks  as well as the other information contained in this annual report  including our consolidated financial statements and related notes and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
any of the risk factors described below could significantly and adversely affect our business  prospects  financial condition  and results of operations 
as a result  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our business if we are unable to continue our recent revenue and earnings growth  our stock price may decline and we may not have adequate financial resources to execute our business plan 
our revenue increased from million in to million in  from million in to million in  and from to in primarily due to strong referrals from current students  new student marketing  and the variety and affordability of our program offerings 
the same factors that led to the growth in revenues also contributed to our net income improving to million in from million in the rate of revenue growth from to was at a slower pace than the rate of growth from to as our revenue base has grown  our growth rate percentages have declined  and it may continue to decline 
you should not rely on the results of any prior periods as an indication of our future operating performance 
if we are unable to maintain adequate revenue and earnings growth  or if investors react negatively to the slowing of our growth rates  the value of our stock price may decline 
our growth may place a strain on our resources that could adversely affect our systems  controls and operating efficiency 
the growth that we have experienced in the past  as well as any future growth that we experience  may place a significant strain on our resources and increase demands on our management information and reporting systems and financial management controls 
we do not have experience scheduling courses and administering programs for more students than our current enrollment  and if growth negatively impacts our ability to do so  the learning experience for our students could be adversely affected  resulting in a higher rate of student attrition and fewer student referrals 
we also have limited experience adding to our courses  programs and operations through acquisitions 
future growth will also require continued improvement of our internal controls and systems  particularly those related to complying with federal regulations under the higher education act of  or the higher education act  as administered by the us department of education  including as a result of our participation in federal student financial aid programs under title iv of the higher education act  which we refer to in this annual report as title iv programs 
we have described some of the most significant regulatory risks that apply to us  including those related to title iv programs  under the heading risks related to the regulation of our industry below 
if we are unable to manage our growth or successfully carry out and integrate acquisitions  we may also experience operating inefficiencies that could increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability and results of operations 
we have recently experienced  and may in the future experience to a greater degree  increases in our administrative and technology infrastructure expenses  our exposure to bad debt and unpredictability in enrollment 
since gaining access to title iv programs  a significant portion of our growth is attributable to students using title iv programs 
this has led to a change in the mix of students that we serve  which has resulted  and will continue to result  in a need to provide a greater level of services to our students 
our costs and expenses have increased due in part to increased general and administrative expenses related to this shift in student mix and primarily attributable to an increase in expenditures for financial aid processing fees  expenditures for technology required to support the increase in civilian students  and increased bad debt primarily associated with our civilian students 
in order to support the number of students we now have and to plan for the future  we also expect that we will make significant investments in our technology infrastructure and financial aid processing capabilities  which from time to time  will result in an increased level of spending  not all of which can be capitalized 
the change in our student mix has also made it harder for us to make long range forecasts about student enrollments 
we have had more difficulty forecasting the number of students who will enroll and have noticed a decrease in the predictability of the rate at which we convert leads into enrolled students  which we attribute  in part  to the growth in civilian students  and particularly the growth in civilian students from outside of public service communities 
if we are unable to manage changes in the composition of our student body and control the growth of related expenditures  we may experience operating inefficiencies that could increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability and results of operations 
the ability of military students to enroll in our courses can be impacted by factors that we do not anticipate  which can impact our registrations and make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast expected enrollment 
beginning with registrations for the third quarter of  we observed that for a period of time the growth of our net course registrations from active duty military students slowed more than we expected 
we do not know all of the factors that caused this to occur 
we believe that the changes we saw in net course registrations from active duty military students were in part due to increased operations activity and overseas deployments across all branches of the us military  particularly the level of activity in the united states marine corps 
we believe that increased demands on many active duty military personnel  combined with limited internet access associated with some deployments  impacted the ability of certain active duty military students to pursue higher education in due to the variability of military activity and other factors over which we have no control  the difficulty in predicting military enrollments that we encountered in could continue in the future or become more pronounced 
in addition  over the next several years the number of active and reserve military professionals is likely to decrease if  as proposed  the military downsizes its forces incrementally 
any decline in the enrollments  or decline in the growth of enrollments  from active duty military students could have an adverse impact on our total net course registrations and revenues 
tuition assistance programs offered to united states armed forces personnel constituted of our adjusted net course registrations for  and our revenues and number of students would decrease if we are no longer able to receive funds under these tuition assistance programs or tuition assistance is reduced or eliminated 
service members of the united states armed forces are eligible to receive tuition assistance from their branch of the armed forces that they may use to pursue postsecondary degrees 
service members of the united states armed forces can use tuition assistance at postsecondary schools that are accredited by accrediting agencies recognized by the us secretary of education and that sign a memorandum of understanding with the department of defense 
we rely for a significant portion of our revenues on the tuition assistance programs offered to united states armed forces personnel 
our tuition is currently structured so that tuition assistance payments for service members fully cover the service member s per course tuition cost of our undergraduate courses and cover more than of the per course tuition cost of our graduate courses 
if we are no longer able to receive tuition assistance payments or the tuition assistance program is reduced or eliminated  our enrollments and revenues would be significantly reduced resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
a recent congressional investigation of dod tuition assistance programs used for distance education and proprietary institutions and a dod rulemaking that increases oversight of educational programs offered to active service members could result in legislation that limits in whole or in part our participation in the tuition assistance program 
in january  senators harkin and durbin introduced legislation that would modify the higher education act s rule 
under the higher education act  a proprietary institution is prohibited from deriving from title iv funds  on a cash accounting basis except for certain institutional loans for any fiscal year  more than of its revenues as computed for rule purposes 
an institution that derives more than of its cash basis revenue from title iv programs for two consecutive fiscal years will be ineligible to participate in title iv programs for at least two fiscal years 
the proposed legislation would decrease the limit to and would count dod tuition assistance and veterans education benefits toward that limit 
in february  companion bills were introduced in the us senate and us house of representatives that would modify the rule to count dod tuition assistance and veterans educations benefits toward the limit  along with title iv programs 
although these changes alone would not have caused american public university system  or apus  to be in violation of the rule based upon revenues  they would reduce the margin of compliance and make apus more vulnerable to changes in its revenue sources 
these changes would also likely reduce competition in the market for military students utilizing dod tuition assistance and veterans educations benefits  which may increase the percentage of our student body comprised by such students  increasing the possibility of our non compliance with the rule  if modified by these proposed changes 
see risks related to the regulation of our industry for additional information on these developments 
in october  the marine corps announced  and later rescinded  new tuition assistance rules that cut the maximum benefit for its service members from  per year to per year and reduced the tuition assistance from per credit hour to per credit hour 
although undergraduate tuition assistance levels have been restored to their prior levels with retroactive benefits to affected service members  the marine corps has warned that the current levels of funding are not sustainable 
the marine corps did reduce graduate level tuition assistance from per credit hour to per credit hour  which is consistent with the current tuition assistance payments from the other military services 
we anticipate that the other services will also consider potential changes to the tuition assistance program 
dod is required to submit a report to the senate and house armed services committees on how to increase the efficiency of tuition assistance program funding  including the impact of changing the program to require service members to pay of their expenses 
the report was due june   but has not been published 
in addition  in october  dod announced that while it will maintain the current levels of tuition assistance in the near term  it plans to consider changes as part of a holistic review of the military compensation package 
we believe modifications to the tuition assistance program may include a reduced per credit tuition benefit currently  a decrease in the annual cap currently  and or require that service members pay out of pocket for a portion of their tuition  among other possible changes 
if tuition assistance payments are reduced  we believe that most service members would be eligible and able to finance out of pocket tuition costs resulting from this shortfall using their top up benefits under the gi bills  which allow service members to use a portion of their gi bill benefits while still on active duty 
however  we do not know whether in the long term service members would be willing to use the top up option  or whether the increased administrative process in using the top up option or covering the shortfall through other funding sources would lead to service members deciding not to enroll or enrolling at a slower rate 
we are not able to estimate the effect of future expected changes to the tuition assistance programs or whether the services would impose other criteria in addition to the level of reimbursement that would impact enrollments from service members 
we are also not able to estimate the response that our competitors would take to reduced tuition assistance payments or the willingness of service members to use their top up option available to them under their veterans benefits 
in this regard  our competitors  particularly those with larger student populations or a smaller concentration of students from the military  may be better situated to lower the cost of tuition to service members 
if we are no longer able to receive tuition assistance payments or the tuition assistance program is reduced or eliminated  our enrollments and revenues could be significantly reduced  which would result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
implementation of executive orders by federal agencies may impose additional regulatory burdens upon us and negatively affect our business or results of operations 
on april   president obama issued an executive order  which we refer to as the eo  that directs the departments of defense  veterans affairs  and education to establish principles of excellence to strengthen oversight  enforcement  and accountability  which we refer to as the principles  in connection with the post gi bill and the dod tuition assistance program 
the eo requires the principles to apply to all education institutions that receive funding from military and veterans education benefits programs  and it does not distinguish among not for profit  public  and for profit institutions 
the principles include  for example  disclosure obligations related to program costs  student aid eligibility  estimated loan debt  student outcomes  and education plans  and a prohibition on fraudulent and aggressive recruiting techniques on and off military installations 
the agencies must implement the principles through various actions  and within days after the date of the eo they must report to the president their progress  including in terms of revisions to regulations  guidance documents  memoranda of understanding  and other policies related to the post gi bill and department of defense tuition assistance 
in addition  among other action  the departments of defense  veterans affairs  and education are directed to develop a comprehensive strategy to establish service member and veteran student outcome measures that are comparable  to the maximum extent practicable  across military and veterans education benefit programs  and the department of education must collect from institutions and publish information on the amount of funding institutions receive from the post gi bill and the dod tuition assistance program 
the eo also contains requirements related to enforcement of and compliance related to the principles  including  for example  development of complaint systems and establishment of procedures for program reviews 
because a significant portion of our students use funding from military and veterans benefits programs  any actions that these agencies take could have a significant impact on our business 
the department of veterans affairs requested that each education institution state  by electronic mail sent by august   its intent to comply with the principles 
we notified the department of veterans affairs that apus intends to make a good faith effort to comply with eo  subject to clarifying guidance and interpretation by the departments of defense  veteran affairs  education and or the consumer financial protection bureau 
on july   the department of education issued guidance on each principle meaning 
the eo requires the secretaries of defense and veterans affairs  in consultation with the secretary of education and the director of the consumer financial protection bureau  to submit a plan to strengthen enforcement and compliance related to the principles before the end of july such plan has not been published 
we do not know what further actions the departments of defense  veterans affairs  and education will take to implement the principles 
strong competition in the postsecondary education market  especially in the online education market  could decrease our market share and increase our cost of acquiring students 
postsecondary education is highly fragmented and competitive 
we compete with traditional public and private two year and four year colleges as well as other for profit schools  particularly those that offer online learning programs 
public and private colleges and universities  as well as other for profit schools  offer programs similar to those we offer 
public institutions receive substantial government subsidies  and public and private institutions have access to government and foundation grants  tax deductible contributions and other financial resources generally not available to for profit schools 
accordingly  public and private institutions may have access to resources that are superior to those in the for profit sector 
in addition  some of our competitors  including both traditional colleges and universities and other for profit schools  have substantially greater name recognition and financial and other resources than we have  which may enable them to compete more effectively for potential students  particularly in the non military sector of the market 
in the military sector of the market  we believe that for profit schools may increasingly be seeking to attract military students  including because these schools may see it as helpful in their efforts to comply with the rule  as currently dod tuition assistance and veterans education benefits do not count towards the limit 
we expect to face increased competition as a result of new entrants to the online education market  including established colleges and universities that have not previously offered online education programs 
we are also continuing to see increasing differentiation between the way in which our competitors are delivering online offerings  which impacts the ability to attract students  facilitate access to education and provide convenience to learners 
we believe that in the future many online students will be attracted to institutions in part because of the technology that the institutions offer and the way in which that technology facilitates access to education and learning 
in addition  we face new competition from various emerging non traditional  credit bearing and non credit bearing education programs  provided by proprietary  not for profit and public providers  including massive open online courses offered worldwide without charge by traditional educational institutions and other direct to consumer education services  as well as other offerings at low costs to students 
these emerging non traditional programs could also lead to fundamental changes in the way in which higher education is delivered and recognized and the value that is placed on a traditional degree of the type we offer 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors and may face competitive pressures that could adversely affect our business or results of operations 
we may also face increased competition if our competitors pursue relationships with the military and governmental educational programs with which we already have relationships 
these competitive factors could cause our enrollments  revenues and profitability to decrease significantly 
if we are unable to update and expand the content of existing programs and develop new programs and specializations on a timely basis and in a cost effective manner  our future growth may be impaired 
the updates and expansions of our existing programs and the development of new programs and specializations may not be accepted by existing or prospective students or employers 
if we cannot respond to changes in market requirements  our business may be adversely affected 
even if we are able to develop acceptable new programs  we may not be able to introduce these new programs as quickly as students require or as quickly as our competitors introduce competing programs 
to offer a new academic program  we may be required to obtain appropriate federal  state and accrediting agency approvals  which may be conditioned or delayed in a manner that could significantly affect our growth plans 
on june   the us district court for the district of columbia vacated the regulations requiring the us department of education to receive notice of and possibly approve any new program that prepares students for gainful employment  which for apus includes most of its programs 
however  pre existing regulations require institutions to obtain department of education approval for new programs under certain circumstances  and it is unclear whether the department of education will repromulgate the vacated regulation in a form that can withstand challenge 
see risks related to the regulation of our industry for additional information on program approval requirements 
if we are unable to respond adequately to changes in market requirements due to financial constraints  regulatory limitations or other factors  our ability to attract and retain students could be impaired and our financial results could suffer 
establishing new academic programs or modifying existing programs requires us to make investments in management  incur marketing expenses and reallocate other resources 
we may have limited experience with the courses in new areas and may need to modify our systems and strategy or enter into arrangements with other institutions to provide new programs effectively and profitably 
if we are unable to increase the number of students  or offer new programs in a cost effective manner  or are otherwise unable to manage effectively the operations of newly established academic programs  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
if we do not have adequate continued personal referrals and marketing and advertising programs that are effective in developing awareness among  attracting and retaining new students  our financial performance in the future would suffer 
building awareness of amu and apu and the programs we offer among potential students is critical to our ability to attract new students 
in order to maintain and increase our revenues and profits  we must continue to attract new students in a cost effective manner and these students must remain active in our programs 
in addition  because we experience declines in our student population as a result of graduation  transfers to other academic institutions  military deployments and other reasons  in order to grow we need to first attract sufficient students to replace those that have left amu or apu 
beginning in and continuing into  we increased the amounts spent on marketing and advertising  and we anticipate this trend to continue  particularly as a result of our attempts to attract and retain students from non military market sectors 
we use marketing tools such as the internet  exhibits at conferences  and print media advertising to promote our schools and programs  and we also began using more traditional media advertising beginning in and continuing through additionally  we rely on the general reputation of amu and apu and referrals from current students  alumni and educational service officers in the united states armed forces as a source of new students 
some of the factors that could prevent us from successfully advertising and marketing our programs and from successfully enrolling and retaining students in our programs include the emergence of more successful competitors and tuition free or other low cost courses  factors related to our marketing  including the costs of internet advertising and broad based branding campaigns  limits on our ability to attract and retain effective employees because of the new incentive payment rule see risks related to the regulation of our industry  performance problems with our online systems  failure to maintain accreditation  student dissatisfaction with our services and programs  failure to develop a message or image that resonates well within non military sectors of the market  adverse publicity regarding us  our competitors or online or for profit education generally  adverse developments in our relationship with military educational service officers  a decline in the acceptance of online education  and a decrease in the perceived or actual economic benefits that students derive from our programs 
on january   the president signed improving transparency of education opportunities for veterans act  which requires the secretary of the department of veterans affairs to develop a policy to improve outreach and transparency to service members and veterans by providing information about institutions of higher education  including a centralized mechanism to publish feedback from students and state approving agencies about each institution quality of instruction  recruiting practices  and placement of graduates 
although the law permits us to verify the feedback and address any issues that we might identify with such feedback before it is published  it is unclear whether the feedback substance or presentation will negatively affect our ability to attract and retain students 
the department of veterans affairs may promulgate regulations to implement the provisions 
in addition  the department of education began publishing a college scorecard on february   which allows students to compare institutions based on data such as potential earnings and average student loan debt 
it is unclear how students will use this tool  and whether it will negatively affect our ability to attract and retain students 
to continue to grow our enrollment  we expect to continue to increase the amounts that we spend on marketing and advertising as our historical approach to marketing and advertising may not be able to sustain meaningful growth rates 
however  because we are smaller than most of our competitors and because our tuition is generally lower  we have fewer funds available to spend on marketing and advertising than they do 
furthermore  our success using marketing approaches that are relatively new to us has led to students that we believe do not perform as well as the students that our historical approach has attained 
accordingly  we may find it increasingly difficult to continue to compete and grow our enrollments 
if we are unable to continue to develop awareness of amu and apu and the programs we offer  and to enroll and retain students in both military and non military market sectors  our enrollments would suffer and our ability to increase revenues and maintain profitability would be significantly impaired 
we have limited experience in making investments in other entities  and any such investments may not result in strategic benefits for us or could expose us to other risks 
in  we made an investment in nwhw holdings  inc  or nwhw holdings  that is intended to result in certain strategic benefits to the company 
to assist us in achieving elements of our growth strategy or to further develop our business capabilities  from time to time we will consider and may pursue strategic investments and acquisitions 
this could include  among other things  investments in  partnerships or joint ventures with  or the acquisition of other schools  service providers or education technology related companies  among other types of entities 
historically  however  we have not made debt or equity investments in other entities  and investing in another entity requires expertise in evaluating another entity business and identifying strategic benefits of a potential investment in such entity  among other expertise 
these types of investments involve significant challenges and risks including that the investment does not advance our business strategy  that it has an adverse effect on our results of operations  that we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment  that we acquire unknown liabilities  or that management attention is diverted from our core business 
these events could harm our operating results or financial condition 
any investments in other entities may also subject us to the operating and financial risks of such entities  and we rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of such entities 
investments in other entities in which we do not have sole control  such as our investment in nwhw holdings  present additional risks 
in a minority investment  we would not have the ability to control the policies  management or affairs of the entity in which we would be investing 
the interests of persons who control these entities may differ from our interests  and they may cause such entities to take actions that are not in our best interest  and we may become involved in disputes with such persons 
our inability to control entities in which we may make investments could negatively affect our ability to realize the strategic benefits of a non controlling investment 
system disruptions and security breaches to our online computer networks could negatively impact our ability to generate revenue and damage our reputation  limiting our ability to attract and retain students 
the performance and reliability of our technology infrastructure is critical to our reputation and ability to attract and retain students 
any system error or failure  or a sudden and significant increase in bandwidth usage  could result in the unavailability of our online classroom  damaging our ability to generate revenue 
our technology infrastructure could be vulnerable to interruption or malfunction due to events beyond our control  including natural disasters  terrorist activities and telecommunications failures 
our systems  particularly those related to partnership at a distance  or pad  have been predominantly developed in house  with limited support from outside vendors 
we are continuously working on upgrades to pad  and our employees continue to devote substantial time to its development 
to the extent that we face problems with the pad system  we may not have the capacity to address the problems with our internal capability  and we may not be able to identify outside contractors with expertise relevant to our custom system 
any computer system error or failure  regardless of cause  could result in a substantial outage that materially disrupts our operations 
not all of our critical systems are protected by a validated formal disaster recovery plan and redundant disaster recovery infrastructure at a geographically remote data center 
we are currently executing our plan to implement disaster recovery infrastructure for our remaining critical systems to allow timely recovery from catastrophic failure 
for those systems not yet protected  a catastrophic failure or unavailability for any reason of our principal data center may require us to replicate the function of this data center at our existing remote data facility or elsewhere  and could result in the loss of data 
an event such as this may require service restoration activities that could take up to several weeks to complete 
any failure of our online classroom system could also prevent students from accessing their courses 
any interruption to our technology infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain students and could require us to incur additional expenses to correct or mitigate the interruption 
our computer networks may also be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer hackers  computer viruses and other security problems 
a user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information  personal information about our students or cause interruptions or malfunctions in operations 
as a result  we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches 
we engage multiple security assessment providers on a periodic basis to review and assess our security 
we utilize this information to audit ourselves to ensure that we are continually monitoring the security of our technology infrastructure 
however  we cannot assure you that these security assessments and audits will protect our computer networks against the threat of security breaches 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we maintain a limited amount of business disruption insurance that may cover certain types of disruptions 
however  there can be no assurance that insurance proceeds  if available  would be adequate to compensate us for damages sustained due to these disruptions 
system disruptions to our online classroom and technology infrastructure could negatively impact our ability to generate revenue and damage our reputation  limiting our ability to attract and retain students 
historically  our online classroom employed the educator learning management system pursuant to a license from ucompass 
com  inc we determined that it was in our long term best interest to transition to a new online classroom that allows us to integrate additional technologies and resources  and in we began the migration to the sakai collaboration and learning environment cle  an open source learning management system  as the foundational software for our online classroom 
our online classroom is central to our operations  and the process of switching to sakai cle was complicated and time consuming  involving customization and integration with the rest of our technology infrastructure 
the migration was completed in early september shortly after the completion of the migration  we experienced periods of unplanned downtime in our online classroom during periods of peak utilization 
we believe that in mid october we identified the cause of this downtime and took appropriate steps to mitigate the problem 
however  we cannot be certain that similar problems will not occur in the future 
while there are reportedly more than educational institutions around the world using sakai cle to support teaching  learning  research and collaboration  we believe that of the institutions using sakai cle  very few  if any  have a larger number of concurrent users than we do 
this means that there are a limited number of other institutions with whom we can compare best practices for use in similar circumstances to ours 
furthermore  to the extent that we face problems with the online classroom in the future  we may not have the ability to address the problems adequately with internal resources  particularly given our limited history using the software  and we may not be able to identify outside contractors with expertise relevant to our customized system 
the performance and reliability of our online classroom and technology infrastructure is critical to our reputation and ability to attract and retain students 
any system error or failure  or a sudden and significant increase in bandwidth usage  could result in the unavailability of our online classroom  preventing students from accessing their courses and damaging our ability to generate revenue 
any significant or ongoing interruption to our technology infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could require us to incur additional expenses to correct or mitigate the interruption 
any of the foregoing problems could result in an adverse impact on our operations  damage to our reputation and limits on our ability to attract and retain students 
the personal information that we collect may be vulnerable to breach  theft or loss that could adversely affect our reputation and operations 
possession and use of personal information in our operations subjects us to risks and costs that could harm our business 
we collect  use and retain large amounts of personal information regarding our students and their families  including social security numbers  tax return information  personal and family financial data and credit card numbers 
also  we collect and maintain personal information of our employees in the ordinary course of our business 
some of this personal information is held and managed by certain of our vendors 
although we use security and business controls to limit access and use of personal information  a third party may be able to circumvent those security and business controls  which could result in a breach of student or employee privacy 
in addition  errors in the storage  use or transmission of personal information could result in a breach of student or employee privacy  and the increased availability and use of mobile data devices by our employees and students increases the risk of unintentional disclosure of personal information 
possession and use of personal information in our operations also subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that could require notification of data breaches and restrict our use of personal information 
we cannot ensure that a breach  loss or theft of personal information will not occur 
a breach  theft or loss of personal information regarding our students and their families or our employees that is held by us or our vendors could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and results of operations and result in liability under state and federal privacy statutes and legal actions by state attorneys  general and private litigants  and any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
future growth or increased technology demands will require continued investment of capital  time and resources to develop and update our technology and if we are unable to increase the capacity of our resources appropriately  our ability to handle growth  our ability to attract or retain students and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our rate of growth and expectations for the future require us to increase the capacity and capabilities of our technology infrastructure 
increasing the capacity and capabilities of our technology infrastructure will require us to invest capital  time and resources  which we expect from time to time will lead to increased spending on technology infrastructure 
there is no assurance that even with sufficient investment our systems will be scalable to accommodate future growth 
we may also need to invest capital  time and resources to update our technology in response to competitive pressures or changes in the marketplace  including the technological preferences of our students and prospective students 
for example  students and prospective students seeking to access our online classroom and related administrative infrastructure through devices such as tablets and mobile telephones  rather than traditional desktop and laptop computers  may find our interface difficult to navigate or inoperable in whole or part 
as a result  prospective students may be discouraged from enrolling in our courses  and current students may be discouraged from completing academic and administrative tasks without assistance 
even with sufficient investment  our resources may become impaired or obsolete 

if we are unable to increase the capacity of our resources or update our resources appropriately  our ability to handle growth  our ability to attract or retain students  and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
similarly  even if we are able to increase the capacity of our resources and update our resources appropriately  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by an increased level of spending 
the loss of any key member of our management team may impair our ability to operate effectively and may harm our business 
our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel 
the loss of one or more members of our management team could harm our business 
except for the employment agreements we have with dr 
boston  our president and chief executive officer  dr 
powell  our executive vice president and provost  dr 
van wyk  our executive vice president and chief operations officer  and mr 
wilkins  our executive vice president and chief financial officer  we do not have employment agreements with any of our other executive officers or key personnel 
if we are unable to attract and retain management  faculty  administrators and skilled personnel  our business and growth prospects could be severely harmed 
to execute our growth strategy  we must attract and retain highly qualified management  faculty  administrators and skilled personnel 
competition for hiring these individuals is intense  especially with regard to faculty in specialized areas 
our growth places constant demands on us to find qualified individuals across all levels of our institution from our most senior managers down throughout the organization 
if we fail to attract new management  faculty  administrators or skilled personnel or fail to retain and motivate our existing management  faculty  administrators and skilled personnel  our business and growth prospects could be severely harmed 
if we fail to maintain adequate systems and processes to detect and prevent fraudulent activity in student enrollment and financial aid  we may lose our ability to participate in title iv programs or department of defense tuition assistance programs or have our participation in the title iv programs conditioned or limited 
we have been the target of fraudulent activity by outside parties with respect to student enrollment and student financial aid programs  and as we continue to grow we may be susceptible to an increased risk of such activities 
the potential for outside parties to perpetrate fraud in connection with the award and disbursement of title iv program funds by apus  including as a result of identity theft  may be heightened due to our nature as an online education provider and our relatively low tuition 
we must maintain systems and processes to identify and prevent fraudulent applications for enrollment and financial aid 
we cannot be certain that our systems and processes will continue to be adequate in the face of increasingly sophisticated fraud schemes or that we will be able to expand such systems and processes at a pace consistent with our growth 
grants and loans to students under the federal government s title iv programs are primarily awarded on the basis of financial need  generally defined as the difference between the cost of attending the institution and the amount a student can be expected to contribute to that cost 
in order to account for living expenses and other costs that our students may reasonably incur in the context of pursuing a degree or certificate  the cost of attending apus is an amount that exceeds the cost of our tuition 
while some students elect to receive grants and loans that cover only the cost of tuition  others elect to receive amounts up to the full cost of attendance 
when apus receives title iv funds from the federal government on a student s behalf  it credits those funds to the student s account 
if a student has elected to receive funds in excess of the cost of tuition and fees  a title iv credit balance occurs  and apus must pay that credit balance to the student unless the student has authorized apus to hold the credit balance or take other permissible action with respect to the credit balance 
the availability of title iv funds  including the title iv credit balance payment  is an important part of enabling some students to pursue a degree or certificate 
however  some individuals seek to take advantage of the availability of title iv funds by enrolling for the purpose of obtaining such funds 
on september   the department of education s inspector general released a report about an increasing number of cases involving large  loosely affiliated groups of individuals  so called fraud rings  who conspire to defraud the title iv programs through enrollment in distance education programs 
these fraud rings are taking advantage of the availability of title iv credit balance payments where the cost of attendance exceeds the cost of tuition and fees 
we have been the target of fraudulent activity by individuals and groups with respect to student enrollment and the title iv programs  and given our continued growth and status as an online education provider and our relatively low tuition  we believe that we will increasingly be subject to such activities 
we must maintain systems and processes to identify and prevent fraudulent applications for enrollment and title iv aid 
we cannot be certain that our systems and processes will be adequate in the face of increasing and increasingly sophisticated fraud schemes or that we will be able to expand such systems and processes at a pace consistent with our growth 
in addition to those who enroll or attempt to enroll solely to obtain title iv funds  some students who might not otherwise pursue a degree or certificate are attracted to enroll because of the availability of title iv funds and economic hardships resulting from today s economic climate 
we believe these students may be more likely than other students to cease pursuing a degree or certificate due to other factors  such as becoming employed or not having the level of commitment necessary to complete successfully the required coursework 
as a result of all of the above factors  the growth in our enrollments reflects some students who will not persist as students 
we have also been the target of fraudulent activities by outside parties with respect to student enrollment and title iv programs  and as we continue to grow  we may be susceptible to an increase of such activities 
we are not able to estimate the number of students who fall into these enrollment categories  and we are not able to estimate the impact on our enrollments over time  or any additional impact that this could have on our exposure to bad debt or the number of our students who default on their title iv student loans 
the department of education requires institutions that participate in title iv programs to refer to the office of the inspector general of the department of education credible information about fraud or other illegal conduct involving title iv programs  and in the past we have referred to the office of the inspector general information with respect to potential fraud by applicants 
if the systems and processes that we have established to detect and prevent fraud are inadequate  or our cohort default rates exceed specified levels or we otherwise do not have procedures in place for safeguarding federal funds  the department of education may find that we do not satisfy its administrative capability requirements 
this could result in our being limited in our access to  or our losing  title iv program funding  which would limit our potential for growth outside the military sector and adversely affect our enrollment  revenues  and results of operations 
in addition  our ability to participate in title iv programs and the tuition assistance programs of the united states armed forces is conditioned on our maintaining accreditation by an accrediting agency that is recognized by the secretary of education 
any significant failure to detect adequately fraudulent activity related to student enrollment and financial aid could cause us to fail to meet our accrediting agencies standards 
furthermore  under the higher education opportunity act  accrediting agencies that evaluate institutions that offer distance learning programs like ours must require such institutions to have processes through which the institution establishes that a student who registers for a distance education program is the same student who participates in and receives credit for the program 
failure to meet our accrediting agencies standards could result in the loss of accreditation at the discretion of our accrediting agencies  which could result in a loss of our eligibility to participate in title iv programs and the tuition assistance programs of the united states armed forces 
on april   the department of education announced that it would publish a notice regarding its intent to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee to prepare proposed regulations for the title iv programs 
the announcement states that the department of education intends to develop proposed regulations designed to prevent fraud and otherwise ensure proper use of title iv program funds  and to improve and streamline the campus based title iv programs 
the announcement states that the department of education is considering regulatory changes related to the disbursement of title iv program funds  particularly electronic funds transfers made directly to a student bank account and available to the student via debit or another bank provided card 
the department of education held two public hearings in may negotiations were expected to begin in but to date the department of education has not announced negotiated rulemaking teams or a negotiated rulemaking schedule 
new regulations could affect the manner in which we do business  increase our cost of doing business  or have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the protection of our operations through exclusive proprietary rights and intellectual property is limited  and we encounter disputes from time to time relating to our use of intellectual property of third parties  any of which could harm our operations and prospects 
in the ordinary course of our business  we develop intellectual property of many kinds that is or will be the subject of copyright  trademark  service mark  patent  trade secret  or other protections 
this intellectual property includes but is not limited to course materials  business know how  software and internal processes and procedures developed to respond to the requirements of operating and various education regulatory agencies 
we rely on a combination of copyrights  trademarks  service marks  trade secrets  domain names  agreements  and registrations to protect our intellectual property 
we rely on service mark and trademark protection in the united states and select foreign jurisdictions to protect our rights to various marks  including american military university  american public university  american public university system  ready when you are 
respected 
affordable 
online 
and educating those who serve  as well as distinctive logos and other marks associated with our services 
we rely on agreements under which we obtain rights to use course content developed by faculty members and other third party content experts 
we cannot assure you that the measures that we take will be adequate or that we have secured  or will be able to secure  appropriate protections for all of our proprietary rights in the united states or select foreign jurisdictions  or that third parties will not infringe upon or violate our proprietary rights 
despite our efforts to protect these rights  unauthorized third parties may attempt to duplicate or copy the proprietary aspects of our curricula  online resource material  other content  software and technology  and offer competing programs and or services to ours 
in particular  third parties may attempt to develop competing programs or services or duplicate or copy aspects of our curriculum  online resource material  quality management  systems and other proprietary content 
any such attempt  if successful  could adversely affect our business 
protecting these types of intellectual property rights can be difficult  particularly as it relates to the development by our competitors of competing courses and programs 
in july  a complaint for a declaratory judgment was commenced against us seeking a judicial declaration that the plaintiff did not infringe certain of our trademark rights 
while we believe that matter was favorably resolved because the third party ceased to use certain marks  we cannot be certain that other third parties will not infringe our trademark or other intellectual property rights in the future or that the rights we believe that we have to our significant trademarks and other intellectual property rights will be found to be enforceable 
we may encounter disputes from time to time over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property  and we may not prevail in these disputes 
we believe that some third parties are becoming more aggressive in pursuing enforcement of their intellectual property portfolios  and these third parties or others may raise a claim against us alleging an infringement or violation of the intellectual property of that third party 
in july  we settled a dispute with another institution regarding the use of certain marks that allowed us to continue to use the marks at issue  but we may not be able to favorably resolve future disputes 
some third party intellectual property rights may be extremely broad  and it may not be possible for us to conduct our operations in such a way as to avoid those intellectual property rights 
any such intellectual property claim could subject us to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether such claim has merit 
our general liability and cyber liability insurance may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all  and we may be required to alter the content of our classes or pay monetary damages  which may be significant 
we may incur liability for the unauthorized duplication or distribution of class materials posted online for class discussions 
in some instances  our faculty members or our students may post various articles or other third party content on class discussion boards 
we may incur liability for the unauthorized duplication or distribution of this material posted online for class discussions 
third parties may raise claims against us for the unauthorized duplication of this material 
any such claims could subject us to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether the claims have merit 
our faculty members or students could also post classified material on class discussion boards  which could expose us to civil and criminal liability and harm our reputation and relationships with members of the military and government 
our general liability insurance may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all  and we may be required to alter the content of our courses or pay monetary damages 
because we are an exclusively online provider of education  we are entirely dependent on continued growth and acceptance of exclusively online education and  if the recognition by students and employers of the value of online education does not continue to grow  our ability to grow our business could be adversely impacted 
we believe that continued growth in online education will be largely dependent on additional students and employers recognizing the value of degrees from online institutions 
if students and employers are not convinced that online schools are an acceptable alternative to traditional schools or that an online education provides value  or if growth in the market penetration of exclusively online education slows  growth in the industry and our business could be adversely affected 
because our business model is based on online education  if the acceptance of online education does not grow  our ability to continue to grow our business and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
if we do not maintain continued strong relationships with various military bases and educational service officers  and if we are unable to expand our use of articulation agreements  our future growth may be impaired 
we have non exclusive articulation agreements or memoranda of understanding with various educational institutions of the united states armed forces and other governmental education programs 
articulation agreements and memoranda of understanding are agreements pursuant to which we agree to award academic credits toward our degrees for learning in educational programs offered by others 
additionally  we rely on relationships with educational service offices on military bases and base education officers to distribute our information to interested service members 
if our relationships with educational service offices or base education counselors deteriorate or end  our efforts to recruit students from that base will be impaired 
if our articulation agreements and memoranda of understanding are eliminated  or if our relationships with educational service offices or base education counselors deteriorate  this could materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
in august  dod issued a proposed rule that would increase oversight of educational programs offered to active service members 
the final rule  published december  and effective january   requires all institutions to sign a memorandum of understanding  or mou  by march  the mou outlines certain commitments and agreements between the institution and dod prior to accepting funds under the tuition assistance program 
we have entered into a mou with dod 
however the requirement to enter into a mou  and the related increased focus by the dod on relationships and oversight of educational providers could lead to changes in the nature of our relationships with military bases and educational service officers including possibly needing to enter into separate installation mous and obtain permission to counsel students in person on the installation  which could be adverse in nature 
at least one installation has banned educational providers from directly counseling potential students on the installation 
additional installations may determine to institute similar bans  which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
the united states armed forces has in the past and may in the future approve programs and initiatives to provide additional educational opportunities to service members  and these programs and initiatives may not include participation by us 
we cannot predict the impact of these announcements  programs  or initiatives on us  but given our dependence on students from the armed forces  our net course registrations  and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by such announcements  programs  and initiatives 
government regulations relating to the internet could increase our cost of doing business  affect our ability to grow or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business 
the increasing popularity and use of the internet and other online services have led and may lead to the adoption of new laws and regulatory practices in the united states or foreign countries and to new interpretations of existing laws and regulations 
these new laws and interpretations may relate to issues such as online privacy  copyrights  trademarks  and service marks  sales taxes  fair business practices  and the requirement that online education institutions qualify to do business as foreign corporations or be licensed in one or more jurisdictions where they have no physical location or other presence 
new laws  regulations  or interpretations related to doing business over the internet could increase our costs and materially and adversely affect our enrollments  revenues  and results of operations 
risks related to the regulation of our industry if we fail to comply with the extensive regulatory requirements for our business  we could face penalties and significant restrictions on our operations  including loss of access to federal tuition assistance programs for members of the united states armed forces and federal loans and grants for our students 
we are subject to extensive regulation by the federal government through the us department of education and under the higher education act  the department of defense and the department of veterans affairs  state regulatory bodies  and accrediting agencies recognized by the us secretary of education 
the regulations  standards and policies of these agencies cover the vast majority of our operations  including our educational programs  facilities  instructional  and administrative staff  administrative procedures  marketing  recruiting  financial operations  and financial condition 
these regulatory requirements can also affect our ability to add new or expand existing educational programs and to change our corporate structure and ownership 
institutions of higher education that grant degrees  diplomas  or certificates must be authorized by an appropriate state education agency or agencies 
in addition  in certain states as a condition of continued authorization to grant degrees and other credentials and in order to participate in various federal programs  including tuition assistance programs of the united states armed forces  a school must be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the secretary of education 
accreditation is a non governmental process through which an institution submits to qualitative review by an organization of peer institutions  based on the standards of the accrediting agency and the stated aims and purposes of the institution 
the higher education act requires accrediting agencies recognized by the department of education to review and monitor many aspects of an institution s operations and to take appropriate action when the institution fails to comply with the accrediting agency s standards 
our operations are also subject to regulation due to our participation in title iv programs 
title iv programs  which are administered by the department of education  include loans made directly to students by the department of education 
title iv programs also include several grant programs for students with economic need as determined in accordance with the higher education act and department of education regulations 
to participate in title iv programs  a school must receive and maintain authorization by the appropriate state education agencies  be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the secretary of education  and be certified as an eligible institution by the department of education 
our growth strategy is partly dependent on enrolling more students who are attracted to us because of our continued participation in these programs 
the regulations  standards  and policies of the department of education  state education agencies  and our accrediting agencies change frequently 
recent and pending changes in  or new interpretations of  applicable laws  regulations  standards  or policies  or our noncompliance with any applicable laws  regulations  standards  or policies  could have a material adverse effect on our accreditation  authorization to operate in various states  activities  receipt of funds under tuition assistance programs of the united states armed forces  our ability to participate in title iv programs  or costs of doing business 
furthermore  findings of noncompliance with these laws  regulations  standards  and policies also could result in our being required to pay monetary damages  or being subjected to fines  penalties  injunctions  limitations on our operations  termination of our ability to grant degrees  revocation of our accreditation  restrictions on our access to title iv program funds  or other censure that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we fail to maintain our institutional accreditation  we would lose our ability to participate in the tuition assistance programs of the united states armed forces and also to participate in title iv programs 
apus is accredited by the higher learning commission of the north central association of colleges and schools  one of six regional accrediting agencies recognized by the secretary of education 
accreditation by an accrediting agency that is recognized by the secretary of education is required for participation in the tuition assistance programs of the united states armed forces 
in  we derived approximately of our revenue from net course registrations from these tuition assistance programs 
accreditation by an accrediting agency that is recognized by the secretary of education for title iv purposes is also required for an institution to become and remain eligible to participate in title iv programs 
apus achieved regional accreditation from the higher learning commission in we were also accredited by the accrediting commission of the distance education and training council  or detc  until april   when we voluntarily withdrew our accreditation 
we have always identified the higher learning commission as our primary accreditor for title iv purposes 
therefore  our withdrawal of detc accreditation did not affect our title iv participation 
the higher learning commission may impose restrictions on our accreditation or may terminate our accreditation 
to remain accredited apus must continuously meet certain criteria and standards relating to  among other things  performance  governance  institutional integrity  educational quality  faculty  administrative capability  resources  and financial stability 
failure to meet any of these criteria or standards could result in the loss of accreditation at the higher learning commission 
loss of accreditation would  among other things  render our students and us ineligible to participate in the tuition assistance programs of the united states armed forces or title iv programs and have a material adverse effect on our enrollments  revenues  and results of operations 
our student enrollments could decline if we fail to maintain any of our accreditations 
accreditation by the higher learning commission is an important attribute of our university system 
colleges and universities depend  in part  on accreditation in evaluating transfers of credit and applications to graduate schools 
employers rely on the accredited status of institutions when evaluating a candidate s credentials  and students and corporate and government sponsors under tuition reimbursement programs look to accreditation for assurance that an institution maintains quality educational standards 
in addition  certain of our individual programs are accredited by specialized accrediting agencies 
if we fail to satisfy the standards of any of those specialized accrediting agencies  we could lose the specialized accreditation for the affected programs  which could result in materially reduced student enrollments in those programs and have a material adverse effect on us 
increased scrutiny of accrediting agencies by the secretary of education and the us congress may result in increased scrutiny of institutions  particularly proprietary institutions  by accrediting agencies  and if our institutional accrediting agency loses its ability to serve as an accrediting agency for title iv program purposes  we may lose our ability to participate in title iv programs 
in november and december  the department of education s office of the inspector general  or oig  issued reports criticizing three regional accreditors middle states commission on higher education  the southern association of colleges and schools  and the higher learning commission for failing to define both program length and credit hours 
oig  in an unusual action  recommended that the department of education consider limiting  suspending  or terminating the higher learning commission s recognition as an accreditor for purposes of determining institutional eligibility to participate in title iv programs 
in response  department of education staff conducted a special review of the higher learning commission and required the higher learning commission to accept a corrective action plan 
the higher learning commission received additional scrutiny in june during a house education and labor committee hearing focused on oig s findings with regard to credit hour policies 
in december  the national advisory committee on institutional quality and integrity  or naciqi  the panel charged with advising the department of education on whether to recognize accrediting agencies for title iv purposes  reviewed the higher learning commission s status as a recognized accrediting agency 
based on the higher learning commission s response to the department s special review and a december interim report which responded to a naciqi review unrelated to the oig findings  naciqi voted to continue the higher learning commission s recognition as an accrediting agency but also ordered the agency to submit an additional compliance report in one year 
at its december meeting  naciqi characterized the higher learning commission s report as informational and noted that no vote was to be taken on it 
we are currently unaware of what further action naciqi might take with respect to the higher learning commission and its compliance report 
naciqi is next scheduled to review the higher learning commission for recognition purposes in spring scrutiny of accrediting agencies and their accreditation of proprietary institutions is likely to continue 
for example  the higher learning commission received further scrutiny in march during a senate help committee hearing focused on accreditation of proprietary institutions 
if the department of education were to limit  suspend  or terminate the higher learning commission s recognition  we would lose our ability to participate in the title iv programs 
our students and our institution would be ineligible to participate in the title iv programs  and such consequence would have a material adverse effect on enrollments  revenues  and results of operations 
in addition  increased scrutiny of accrediting agencies by the secretary of education in connection with the department of education s recognition process may result in increased scrutiny of institutions by accrediting agencies 
furthermore  because the for profit education sector is growing at such a rapid pace  it is possible that accrediting bodies will respond to that growth by adopting additional criteria  standards  and policies that are intended to monitor  regulate  or limit the growth of for profit institutions like us 
for example  in june and february  the higher learning commission adopted new policies related to institutional control  structure  and organization 
part of the higher learning commission s rationale for these changes was to better define the range of its oversight of transactions related to change of ownership at institutions 
the new policies extend the higher learning commission s oversight to transactions that change  or have the potential to change  the control of an institution or its fundamental structure and organization 
under the new policies  the higher learning commission also now extends its oversight to defined changes that occur in a parent or controlling entity  and not necessarily in the institution itself 
actions by  or relating to  an accredited institution  including a significant acquisition of another institution  significant changes in board composition or organizational documents  and accumulations by one stockholder of greater than of the capital stock  could open up an accredited institution to additional reviews by the higher learning commission and possible change from an accredited status to candidate status  which enhances the risks of these types of actions 
in particular  the change from accredited status to candidate status could adversely impact an institution s ability to participate in title iv programs 
for profit institutions may also be less attractive acquisition candidates because the higher learning commission has enhanced its scrutiny of change in control transactions  obtained the explicit ability to move an institution from accredited status to candidate status  and will be examining more closely entities that own accredited institutions 
if the higher learning commission determines that a change required its prior approval but an institution failed to obtain such approval  the higher learning commission may consider withdrawing accreditation 
new and anticipated regulations published by the us department of education could result in regulatory changes that may materially and adversely affect our business 
on october   the department of education published final regulations concerning certain institutional eligibility issues such as state authorization for postsecondary education institutions  definitional issues such as the definition of credit hour for certain eligibility and other purposes  student eligibility issues including the validity of high school diplomas  and other title iv provisions such as gainful employment program reporting and disclosure  incentive payment and misrepresentation  as well as final regulations to establish a process under which an institution applies for approval to offer an educational program that prepares students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation 
these final regulations were generally effective july  on june   the department of education published final regulations on metrics for gainful employment programs effective july  collectively  the october and june regulations are referred to as the program integrity regulations 
on june   the us district court for the district of columbia struck down the metrics for gainful employment programs and certain related requirements  including the requirement that an institution obtain department of education approval for new gainful employment programs  the court ruled one day before the metrics would have gone into effect 
the program integrity regulations are described above in regulation of title iv financial aid programs recent regulatory changes 
on may   the department of education announced its intention to establish additional negotiated rulemaking committees to prepare proposed regulations under the higher education act 
three public hearings were conducted in may at which interested parties suggested issues that should be considered for action by the negotiating committees 
the department of education also conducted roundtable discussions to inform policy in the areas of teacher preparation  college completion  and the proposed first in the world competition 
in spring  the department of education convened two negotiated rulemaking committees one on teacher preparation and one on student loans that each held a series of meetings to discuss proposed changes to applicable regulations 
negotiators reached consensus on proposed regulatory language on student loan issues  which will result in two packages of proposed rules to be published for public comment before final promulgation 
proposed rules relating to various loan repayment issues  including a new income based repayment plan for the direct loan program  were issued november  although the rule was originally scheduled to become effective on july   the department of education announced the rule would go into effect on december  also  the department of education issued a nprm on july  addressing discharges of loans for borrowers who suffer from total and permanent disability  and the department of education promulgated final rules on november  proposed rules relating to other loan related topics are expected in  to be effective in negotiators failed to reach consensus on proposed regulations related to teacher preparation programs and the awarding of teach grants 
the committee disagreed about how  if at all  students test scores should be used to judge the effectiveness of their teachers preparation program 
such so called value added scores were promoted by the department of education during the negotiations as one way to determine which institutions should be eligible to award teach grants to students in their teacher preparation programs 
as the negotiators failed to reach consensus  the department of education is now responsible for drafting proposed regulations  to be released at a future date 
if our efforts to comply with new and pending regulations are inconsistent with how the department of education interprets those provisions  due to uncertainty about the meaning of the rules or otherwise  we may be found to be in noncompliance with such provisions and the department of education could impose monetary penalties  place limitations on our operations  and or condition or terminate our eligibility to receive title iv program funds 
we cannot predict with certainty the effect the new and pending regulatory provisions will have on our business 
a number of the risk factors below address potential substantive concerns and risks with respect to the new regulations 
with respect to the final regulations generally  and each of the regulations discussed in the risk factors below specifically  we cannot predict how the final regulations will be interpreted 
compliance with any of these new rules or uncertainty that results from the rules being recently promulgated and the absence of past practice and limited guidance as to the implementation of these new rules could have an adverse impact on our enrollment  affect the manner in which we do business  increase our cost of doing business  and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
lack of clarity in the final rules or guidance by the department of education could result in uncertainties continuing for some period of time  and may require us to adopt overly narrow practices until clarity is obtained  and as a result our business could be materially and adversely affected 
a failure to meet us department of education standards regarding gainful employment may result in the loss of eligibility to participate in title iv programs 
on june   the department of education published final regulations on gainful employment programs effective july  the regulations established metrics related to student loan repayment rates and debt to income ratios for gainful employment programs 
if a program failed all three of the gainful employment metrics in a given year  the us department of education would require the institution to disclose the amount by which the program under performed the metrics and the institution s plan for program improvement 
also  the regulations required an institution to establish a three day waiting period for enrollment after the warning information is given 
if a program failed to achieve the metrics twice within three years  the institution had to continue to provide the first year disclosures and  among other things  also disclose to current and prospective students that they should expect to have difficulty repaying their student loans  provide an explanation of the risks associated with enrolling or continuing in the program  including the potential consequences for  and options available to  the student if the program became ineligible for title iv funds  and explain the resources available to research other educational options and compare program costs 
should a program fail three times within a four year period  the regulations permitted the department of education to terminate the program s eligibility for federal student aid ie  students in the program would immediately lose eligibility to participate in title iv programs  and the institution would not be able to reestablish the program s eligibility for at least three years  though the program could continue to operate without title iv funding 
in addition  the regulations required institutions to notify the department of education at least days before commencing a new educational program leading to gainful employment in a recognized occupation 
the regulations required the department of education to approve a new program in certain circumstances 
on june   the us district court for the district of columbia vacated these regulations 
the court did not vacate the requirement that institutions provide information to prospective students on their website and in their promotional materials about their gainful employment programs  such as the occupations that the gainful employment program prepares the student to enter  on time graduate rates for students in the program  cost  job placement rate  and median loan debt incurred by graduates of the program 
the department of education required institutions to make such disclosures by july   and to update such disclosures for the award year by january  these disclosure requirements  and the requirements for reporting to the department and to our students information relating to programs  have increased our administrative burdens 
the disclosure requirements could impact student enrollment and retention in ways that we cannot now predict 
for example  if our disclosures compare unfavorably with those of other educational institutions  such disclosures could adversely impact student enrollment 
on july   the department of education filed a motion to alter or amend the court june  judgment 
the department of education argued in its motion that even though it would not be permitted to sanction education institutions for failure to meet the debt measure thresholds i education institutions should disclose information to the department of education that will allow the department of education to calculate the debt measures and ii education institutions should include the results of the debt measure calculations in their disclosures to prospective students 
on september   the us district court for the district of columbia requested a supplemental briefing by the parties addressing  in brief  i the scope of the department of education statutory authorization to maintain a database of information about student borrowers and ii the authority on which the department of education relied to argue that it could require education institutions to provide information to the department of education for purposes of calculating the debt measures and then require education institutions to disclose the results of those debt measure calculations 
the parties filed supplemental briefs in november  and the us district court for the district of columbia is expected to render a decision in if the regulations are reinstated on appeal or repromulgated by the department of education  it is not possible at this time to determine with any degree of certainty whether such future regulations will cause any of our programs to become ineligible to participate in the title iv programs owing to factors beyond our control  such as changes in the actual or deemed income level of our graduates  changes in student borrowing levels  increases in interest rates  changes in the federal poverty income level relevant for calculating discretionary income  changes in the percentage of our former students who are current in repayment of their student loans  and other factors 
in addition  even though deficiencies in the metrics may be correctible on a timely basis  if we are required to disclose such metrics to students it may adversely impact enrollment in certain programs and may adversely impact the reputation of our educational institutions 
our failure to obtain department of education approval  where required  for new programs that prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation could materially and adversely affect our business 
on october   the department of education issued final regulations to establish a new process under which an institution applies for approval to offer an educational program that prepares students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation 
under the final regulations  which became effective july   an institution must notify the department of education at least days before the first day of class when it intends to add a program that prepares students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation 
the institution seeking approval may proceed to offer the program  unless the department of education advises the institution at least days before the first day of classes that the department of education must approve the program for title iv purposes 
if the department of education denies approval  the institution may not award title iv funds in connection with the program 
on june   us district court for the district of columbia vacated the regulations requiring the us department of education to receive notice of and possibly approve any new program that prepares students for gainful employment  which for apus includes most of its programs 
pending a final ruling in this case  the department of education has advised institutions to follow the rules on additional programs that immediately preceded the gainful employment rules 
the version once again in effect provides that approval of new programs is not required if the additional program prepares students for gainful employment in the same or related occupation as an educational program that has previously been designated as eligible and is at least eight semester hour  quarter hours  or clock hours 
it is unclear whether the department of education will repromulgate the regulation in a form that can withstand challenge 
see risks related to the regulation of our industry for additional information on these new program approval requirements 
if the department were to deny approval to one or more of our new programs  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
furthermore  compliance with any new procedures could cause delay in our ability to offer new programs and put our business at a competitive disadvantage 
compliance could also adversely affect our ability to timely offer programs of interest to our students and potential students and adversely affect our ability to increase our revenues 
as a result  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
our failure to comply with the department of education s incentive payment rule could result in sanctions 
if we pay a bonus  commission  or other incentive payment in violation of applicable department of education rules  we could be subject to sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in the final regulations published on october   the department of education abolished safe harbors that described permissible arrangements under the regulation 
the amended regulation was effective july  abolition of the safe harbors and other aspects of the new regulation may create uncertainty about what constitutes impermissible incentive payments 
the modified incentive payment rule and related uncertainty as to how it will be interpreted also may influence our approach  or limit our alternatives  with respect to employment policies and practices and consequently may affect negatively our ability to recruit and retain employees  and as a result our business could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  the government accountability office  or gao  has issued a report critical of the department of education s enforcement of the incentive payment rule  and the department of education has undertaken to increase its enforcement efforts 
if the department of education determines that an institution violated the incentive payment rule  it may require the institution to modify its payment arrangements to the department of education s satisfaction 
the department of education may also fine the institution or initiate action to limit  suspend  or terminate the institution s participation in the title iv programs 
the department of education may also seek to recover title iv funds disbursed in connection with the prohibited incentive payments 
in addition  third parties may file qui tam or whistleblower suits on behalf of the department of education alleging violation of the incentive payment provision 
such suits may prompt department of education investigations 
particularly in light of the uncertainty surrounding the new incentive payment rule  the existence of  the costs of responding to  and the outcome of  qui tam or whistleblower suits or department of education investigations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation causing our enrollments to decline and could cause us to incur costs that are material to our business  among other things 
as a result  our business could be materially and adversely affected our failure to comply with the department of education s substantial misrepresentation rules could result in sanctions 
the department of education may take action against an institution in the event of substantial misrepresentation by the institution concerning the nature of its educational programs  its financial charges or the employability of its graduates 
in the final regulations published on october   the department of education has expanded the activities that constitute a substantial misrepresentation  effective july  under the final regulation  an institution engages in substantial misrepresentation when the institution itself  one of its representatives  or an organization or person with which the institution has an agreement to provide educational programs  marketing  advertising  or admissions services  makes a substantial misrepresentation directly or indirectly to a student  prospective student or any member of the public  or to an accrediting agency  a state agency  or to the secretary of education 
the final regulations define misrepresentation as any false  erroneous or misleading statement  and they define a misleading statement as any statement that has the likelihood or tendency to deceive or confuse 
the final regulations define substantial misrepresentation as any misrepresentation on which the person to whom it was made could reasonably be expected to rely  or has reasonably relied  to the person s detriment 
if the department of education determines that an institution has engaged in substantial misrepresentation  the department of education may revoke an institution s program participation agreement  impose limitations on an institution s participation in the title iv programs  deny participation applications made on behalf of the institution  or initiate a proceeding against the institution to fine the institution or to limit  suspend or termination the institution s participation in the title iv programs 
on june   the us court of appeals for the district of columbia vacated portions of the substantial misrepresentation regulation that permitted the us department of education to i revoke an institution program participation agreement or impose limitations on an institution participation without affording procedural protections  ii proscribe misrepresentations with respect to subjects not covered by the higher education act  and iii proscribe statements that are merely confusing 
the court remanded the matters so that the department of education can revise the regulations 
the department of education could promulgate regulations that expand its role in monitoring and enforcing prohibitions on misrepresentation 
this could lead to an increase in administrative actions and litigation claiming substantial misrepresentation  which at a minimum would increase legal costs associated with defending such actions 
as a result  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
failure to comply with the department of education s credit hour requirements could result in sanctions 
in the final regulations published on october   the department of education has defined credit hour for title iv purposes 
the credit hour is used for title iv purposes to define an eligible program and an academic year and to determine enrollment status and the amount of title iv aid that an institution may disburse in a payment period 
the final regulations define credit hour as an institutionally established equivalency that reasonably approximates certain specified time in class and out of class or an equivalent amount of work for other academic activities 
the final regulations also require institutional accreditors to review an institution s policies  procedures  and administration of policies and procedures for assignment of credit hours 
an accreditor must take appropriate actions to address an institution s credit hour deficiencies and to notify the department of education if it finds systemic noncompliance or significant noncompliance in one or more programs 
the department of education has indicated that if it finds an institution to be out of compliance with the credit hour definition for title iv purposes  it may require the institution to repay the amount of title iv awarded under the incorrect assignment of credit hours and  if it finds significant overstatement of credit hours  it may fine the institution or limit  suspend  or terminate its participation in title iv programs  as a result of which our business could be materially and adversely affected 
failure to comply with the department of education s state authorization rules could result in our students being ineligible for title iv programs 
to be eligible for title iv programs  an institution must be legally authorized to provide postsecondary education in the state in which it is physically located 
in the final regulations published on october   the department of education specified the type of state approvals that are acceptable for an institution to demonstrate that it is legally authorized by the state in which it is located 
the regulations also provide that states must have mechanisms to take appropriate action against institutions and to respond to complaints 
currently  apus is headquartered in the state of west virginia and is authorized by the west virginia higher education policy commission 
apus has a physical presence in the commonwealth of virginia based on administrative offices in that state  and it is authorized by the state council of higher education for virginia 
we believe that the only state licensure or authorization that is currently necessary for apus to participate in the tuition assistance programs for the united states armed forces and in title iv programs is our authorization from the west virginia higher education policy commission 
it is possible that west virginia and other states could  as a result of the limited amount of time for states to evaluate and implement the department of education s final state authorization rule or otherwise  adopt standards that are detrimental to institutions such as ours 
as a result  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
if we acquire additional locations  we will need to seek authorization from the states where they are physically located 
if apus does not maintain its authorization in west virginia  our operations would be curtailed  and we may not grant degrees 
apus is headquartered in the state of west virginia and is authorized by the west virginia higher education policy commission to grants degrees  diplomas and certificates 
the west virginia higher education policy commission may also take disciplinary action or revoke authorization if an institution s bond is cancelled  if the institution fails to take corrective action to bring it into compliance with west virginia higher education policy commission policies  or if the owner is convicted for a felony or crime involving institution administration of title iv programs 
under current west virginia law  if we were to lose our accreditation by the higher learning commission  the west virginia higher education policy commission may suspend  withdraw  or revoke our authorization 
in addition  in order to maintain our eligibility for accreditation by the higher learning commission  we must remain headquartered and have a substantial presence in one of the states in its region  which includes west virginia 
thus  if we were to lose our authorization from the west virginia higher education policy commission  we would be unable to provide educational services in west virginia  we would lose our eligibility for title iv programs  and we would lose our regional accreditation 
our failure to comply with regulations of various states could have a material adverse effect on our enrollments  revenues  and results of operations 
various states impose regulatory requirements on educational institutions operating within their boundaries 
several states assert jurisdiction over online educational institutions that have no physical location or other presence in the state but offer educational services to students who reside in the state or advertise to or recruit prospective students in the state 
state regulatory requirements for online education are inconsistent among states and not well developed in many jurisdictions 
as such  these requirements change frequently and  in some instances  are not clear or are left to the discretion of state regulators 
in final regulations published on october   the department of education stated that if an institution offers postsecondary education through distance education to students in a state in which the institution is not physically located  the institution must meet state requirements for it to be legally offering postsecondary distance education in that state 
that rule was effective on july   although in an april guidance letter the department of education indicated that it would not initiate any action to establish repayment liabilities or limit student eligibility for distance education activities undertaken before july   provided the institution was making a good faith effort to identify and obtain necessary state authorization before that date 
on july   the us district court for the district of columbia vacated the portion of the department of education state authorization regulation that requires online education providers to obtain any required authorizations from all states in which their students reside  finding that the department of education had failed to provide sufficient notice and opportunity for comment on the requirement 
on june   the us court of appeals for the district of columbia affirmed the district court july  ruling 
on july   the department of education issued a dear colleague letter cautioning education institutions to remain in compliance with all applicable state laws and regulations related to distance education 
the level of regulatory oversight varies substantially from state to state 
in some us states  institutions are subject to licensure by the state education agency and also by a separate state agency or agencies  depending on the programs offered 
some states have sought to assert jurisdiction over online educational institutions that offer educational services to residents in the state or that advertise or recruit in the state  notwithstanding the lack of a physical location in the state 
state laws may establish standards for instruction  qualifications of faculty  location and nature of facilities  financial policies and responsibility and other operational matters 
state laws and regulations may limit our ability to obtain authorization to operate in certain states or to award degrees or diplomas or offer new degree programs 
furthermore  certain states prescribe standards of financial responsibility that are different from those prescribed by the us department of education 
the department of education s distance education state authorization requirement could lead some states to adopt new laws and regulatory practices affecting the delivery of distance education to students located in those states 
in the event we are found not to be in compliance with a state s new or existing requirements for offering distance education within that state  the state could seek to restrict one or more of our business activities within its boundaries  we may not be able to recruit students from that state  and may have to cease providing service to students in that state 
in addition  the department of education has not announced its next steps  but it may engage in the future in a negotiated rulemaking to address distance education and state authorization 
should the federal distance education requirements published in october be enforced in the future  and if we fail to obtain required state authorization to provide postsecondary distance education in a specific state  we could lose our ability to award title iv aid to students in that state 
the requirements of some states regulations could make it more difficult for us to successfully pursue particular program initiatives 
some states have regulations that apply to certain types of programs 
for example  a number of states require that we obtain additional authorizations for our students to pursue sponsored internships or participate in practicums in the states  even where we have no other physical presence in the state 
these types of provisions may make it more difficult for us to offer certain programs or degrees in those states 
program initiatives  such as our teacher education programs  that include on the ground components eg  student teaching  professional internships  etc 
that may be described as instructional activities  will be viewed by some state regulatory agencies as constituting a physical presence for regulatory purposes 
as we expand some of our existing programs and pursue new programs  there is a high probability that we will need to seek formal authorization to operate in some states where historically we were not required to do so 
the extent of this expansion in regulatory requirements  and the associated costs  are not known at this time  but we anticipate they may be significant 
furthermore  there may be some states where it takes a significant amount of time to meet the applicable regulatory requirements with respect to a new program initiative  or where we are not able to do so at all 
the inability to efficiently or successfully expand existing programs and pursue new program initiatives would harm our ability to grow our business and meet our business objectives and could lead to higher regulatory costs and expose us to adverse actions by state regulators 
our experience with the title iv programs is limited  because we only began to participate in the programs in  and our failure to comply with the complex regulations associated with title iv programs would have a significant adverse effect on our operations and prospects for growth 
we first became certified to participate in title iv programs for classes beginning in november we expect a significant portion of our growth in enrollments and revenues to come from students who are utilizing funds from title iv programs 
however  compliance with the requirements of the higher education act and title iv programs is highly complex and imposes significant additional regulatory requirements on our operations  which require additional staff  contractual arrangements  systems and regulatory costs 
we have limited demonstrated history of compliance with these additional regulatory requirements  and as discussed in the risk factor immediately below  in the department of education found that we failed to properly calculate and return federal financial aid in accordance with applicable title iv policies  resulting in apus having a  liability to the department 
if we fail to comply with any of the regulatory requirements under title iv programs  the department of education could  among other things  impose monetary penalties  place limitations on our operations  and or condition or terminate our eligibility to receive title iv program funds  which would limit our potential for growth outside the military sector and adversely affect our enrollment  revenues  and results of operations 
government and regulatory agencies and third parties may conduct compliance reviews  bring claims  or initiate litigation against us  any of which could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our performance 
because we operate in a highly regulated industry  we are subject to compliance reviews and claims of noncompliance and lawsuits by government agencies  regulatory agencies  and third parties  including claims brought by third parties on behalf of the federal government 
for example  the department of education regularly conducts program reviews of educational institutions that are participating in the title iv programs and the office of inspector general of the department of education regularly conducts audits and investigations of such institutions 
in august  the secretary of education announced in a letter to several members of congress that  in part in response to recent allegations against proprietary institutions of deceptive trade practices and noncompliance with department of education regulations  the department planned to strengthen its oversight of title iv programs through  among other approaches  increasing the number of program reviews by  from conducted in up to reviews in if the results of compliance reviews or other proceedings are unfavorable to us  or if we are unable to defend successfully against lawsuits or claims  we may be required to pay monetary damages or be subject to fines  limitations  loss of title iv funding  injunctions  or other penalties  including the requirement to make refunds 
even if we adequately address issues raised by an agency review or successfully defend a lawsuit or claim  we may have to divert significant financial and management resources from our ongoing business operations to address issues raised by those reviews or to defend against those lawsuits or claims 
claims and lawsuits brought against us may damage our reputation  even if such claims and lawsuits are without merit 
on february  the us department of education began an on site program review of apus administration of the title iv programs 
on may  the department of education issued a final program review determination  or fprd 
the fprd identified liabilities resulting from the program review report findings  provided instructions for payment of the liabilities to the department of education  notified apus of its right to appeal  and notified apus that under department of education regulations  apus is required to post an irrevocable letter of credit payable to the us secretary of education due to the number of unpaid and late refunds identified as part of the program review 
the liabilities and letter of credit requirements are based on the program review report finding that apus policies improperly failed to treat certain students as having unofficially withdrawn from the institution and that apus consequently failed to calculate and return federal student financial aid to the department of education as a result of these unofficial withdrawals 
the fprd stated that apus total monetary liability  including interest  is  notwithstanding that the company disagrees with the department position  after considering the time  effort  expense and other factors involved in a full appeal  the company determined to pay the liability 
because we cannot be assured that we will be able to collect the full amounts from the relevant former students  we have established a partial reserve against these receivables 
we will continue to monitor the collection history and the reserve established 
in response to the fprd  we have also posted an irrevocable letter of credit in favor of the department of education in the amount of  certain of our students are eligible to receive funds from education assistance programs administered by the department of veterans affairs  including under the gi bills 
pursuant to federal law related to those programs  we are approved for education of veterans and members of the selective reserve and their dependents by the state approving agencies in virginia and west virginia 
on april   the department of veterans affairs began an on site program review of our programs 
the on site review was concluded on april   and we have not yet received a formal report from the department of veterans affairs 
we must periodically seek recertification to participate in title iv programs  and may  in certain circumstances  be subject to review by the department of education prior to seeking recertification  and our future success may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully maintain certification or obtain recertification 
an institution generally must seek recertification from the department of education at least every six years and possibly more frequently depending on various factors  such as whether it is provisionally certified 
the department of education may also review an institution s continued eligibility and certification to participate in title iv programs  or scope of eligibility and certification  in the event the institution undergoes a change in ownership resulting in a change of control or expands its activities in certain ways  such as the addition of certain types of new programs  or  in certain cases  changes to the academic credentials that it offers 
in certain circumstances  the department of education must provisionally certify an institution  such as when it is an initial participant in title iv programs or has undergone a change in ownership and control 
in  we applied to participate in title iv programs for the first time and were provisionally certified for a period through june  we timely submitted our application for recertification  and the department of education granted us provisional certification through june  in may  we were fully recertified to participate in title iv programs 
in august  we were deemed to have undergone a change in ownership and control requiring review by the department of education in order to reestablish our eligibility and continue participation in title iv programs 
as required under department of education regulations  we timely notified the department of education of our change in ownership and control 
in connection with the department of education s review of the change  we submitted to the department of education a change in ownership application that included the submission of required documentation  including a letter from the higher learning commission indicating that it had approved the change 
on october   we received a letter from the department of education approving the change in ownership and control and granting us provisional certification until september  a provisionally certified institution must apply for and receive department of education approval of substantial changes and must comply with any additional conditions included in its program participation agreement 
if the department of education determines that a provisionally certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program participation agreement  it may seek to revoke the institution s certification to participate in title iv programs with fewer due process protections for the institution than if it were fully certified 
the department of education may withdraw the institution s certification if it determines that the institution is not fulfilling material requirements for continued participation in title iv programs 
in  we applied for recertification and  on july   we received a letter from the department of education notifying us that we are fully recertified to participate in title iv programs through december  if the department of education were to withdraw or not renew our certification to participate in title iv programs  our students would no longer be able to receive title iv program funds  which would have a material adverse effect on our enrollments  revenues  and results of operations 
in addition  regulatory restraints related to the addition of new programs could impair our ability to attract and retain students and could negatively affect our financial results 
the us congress has been examining the for profit postsecondary education sector  which could result in legislation or additional department of education rulemaking that may limit or condition title iv program participation of proprietary schools in a manner that may materially and adversely affect our business 
in recent years  the us congress has increased its focus on for profit education institutions  including a review of their participation in the title iv programs 
beginning in june  the help committee held hearings to examine the proprietary education sector 
on august   we received a letter from senator tom harkin  chairman of the help committee  requesting documents as part of a review of matters related to for profit postsecondary education institutions whose students receive federal student financial aid 
we understand that the request was one of approximately thirty requests made to for profit colleges in connection with the help committee s review of matters related to for profit colleges participating in title iv programs 
in june  the education and labor committee of the us house of representatives held a hearing to examine accreditors standards and procedures pertinent to higher education institutions policies on credit hours and program length 
during the hearing  some committee members voiced concerns about the growing proportion of federal student financial aid going to proprietary institutions 
on june  the chairmen of each of the senate and house education committees  together with other members of congress  requested the gao to conduct a review and prepare a report with recommendations regarding various aspects of the proprietary education sector  including recruitment practices  educational quality  student outcomes  the sufficiency of integrity safeguards against waste  fraud and abuse in title iv programs  and the degree to which proprietary institutions revenue is comprised of title iv and other federal funding sources 
on august  the gao released a report based on a three month undercover investigation of recruiting practices at proprietary institutions  which concluded that employees at a non random sample of proprietary institutions which did not include apus made deceptive statements to students about accreditation  graduation rates  job placement  program costs  or financial aid 
on november   the gao issued a revised version of that report that corrected or further explained a number of the instances of allegedly deceptive conduct 
we incurred significant legal and other costs to respond to the congressional inquiry  and could incur significant legal and other cost to respond to any future inquiries 
on august   the senate help committee held a hearing to examine the student recruitment experience at for profit postsecondary education institutions  and on september   the senate help committee held a hearing in regard to the federal investment in for profit education and the resulting student outcomes 
the senate help committee held additional hearings in on march   the committee held a hearing to present a case study of another for profit postsecondary education institution  its educational services  and the role of accreditor  state  and federal oversight 
a hearing about financial outcomes of students at for profit colleges was held by the senate help committee on june  at a number of hearings  committee members have expressed concern about the amount of student loan debt taken on by students at for profit institutions 
following those hearings  on july   the committee hosted a roundtable discussion of policy solutions for improving for profit postsecondary education 
on july   the help committee issued a final report entitled for profit higher education the failure to safeguard the federal investment and ensure student success  which summarized the results of its investigations 
while the report acknowledged that for profit education institutions have a role to play in american society given insufficient capacity at not for profit and public education institutions  it made specific policy suggestions for future legislation that could affect proprietary institutions  including tying access to federal aid to meeting minimum student outcome thresholds  prohibiting institutions from funding marketing  advertising and recruiting activities with federal financial aid dollars  improving cohort default rate tracking by expanding the default reporting rate period beyond years  requiring that proprietary colleges receive at least percent of revenues from sources other than federal funds  and using criteria beyond accreditation and state authorization for determining institutions access to federal financial aid 
the report was not adopted by the full committee  and the minority members released their own report criticizing the majority investigation in many aspects  including that it did not include a review of all institutions of higher education 
despite the fact that the full committee did not adopt the report  congress may consider the report as it begins the process of reauthorizing the higher education act 
on september   a group of senators wrote a letter to the federal trade commission urging it to evaluate the marketing practices utilized by many proprietary institutions through the use of third party lead generators 
in addition  legislation was introduced in the senate in april  which would prevent institutions from using title iv funds for marketing activities 
on october   the gao released a second report following additional undercover investigation related to enrollment  cost  financial aid  course structure  substandard student performance  withdrawal  and exit counseling 
the report concluded that while some of the unidentified for profit schools investigated appeared to follow existing policies  others did not 
although the report identified a number of deficiencies in specific instances  it made no recommendations 
on december   the gao released a report that attempted to compare the quality of education provided by for profit  not for profit  and public schools based upon multiple outcome measures including graduation rates  pass rates on licensing exams  employment outcomes  and student loan default rates 
the report found that for profit school students had higher graduation rates for certificate programs  similar graduation rates for associate s degree programs  and lower graduation rates for bachelor s degree programs than students at not for profit and public schools 
it also found that a higher proportion of bachelor s degree recipients from for profit schools took out loans than did degree recipients from other schools and that there is some evidence that students at for profits schools default on their student loans at higher rates 
on nine of the licensing exams reviewed  graduates of for profit schools had lower pass rates than students from not for profit and public schools 
the consumer financial protection bureau  or cfpb  submitted two reports to congress in with specific recommendations for restructuring the student borrowing experience  including requiring institutions to certify that a student is not eligible for any further federal funds before a private loan may be issued to such student 
in addition  on january   cfpb encouraged institutions of higher education  students  and others to provide information to the cfpb by march  about the financial products and services currently offered to students  and comments on how current and future arrangements between institutions of higher education and financial institutions could be structured in order to promote positive financial decision making among consumers 
on january   senator durbin introduced the know before you owe private student loan act of  which would require institutions to certify to a private loan lender a student cost of attendance and estimated federal financial assistance before a loan may be issued to such student 
the act would also require institutions to counsel students about their loan options  including discussion of differences between federal loans and private loans 
private loan lenders would be required to provide students with quarterly account updates on the balance and interest accrued 
on january   senator durbin also introduced the fairness for struggling students act of  which would allow private student loans to be dischargeable in bankruptcy 
we do not know what steps congress may take in response to these actions and whether such actions if any will have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
in addition  other congressional hearings and reviews addressing various aspects of the education sector may occur  which may affect our business 
the confluence of the increasing scrutiny in congress of the proprietary education sector and the unprecedented federal budget deficits increases the likelihood of legislation that will adversely impact our business 
we cannot predict the extent to which  or whether  these hearings and reviews will result in legislation  further rulemaking affecting our participation in title iv programs  or more vigorous enforcement of title iv requirements 
legislation  for example  could be focused on measures of student outcomes that do not take into account that as an institution that has historically had an open enrollment policy  we will naturally have a lower graduation rate than institutions that have selective admission policies 
to the extent that any laws or regulations are adopted that limit or condition title iv program participation or the amount of federal student financial aid for which our students are eligible  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
congressional examination of department of defense oversight of tuition assistance used for distance education and proprietary institutions and pending rulemaking by the department of defense could result in legislative or regulatory changes that may materially and adversely affect our business 
in recent years  the us congress has increased its focus on dod tuition assistance that is used for distance education and programs at proprietary institutions 
in september  the subcommittee on oversight and investigations of the us house of representative s armed services committee held a hearing titled a question of quality and value department of defense oversight of tuition assistance used for distance learning and for profit colleges 
witnesses and subcommittee members expressed concern about dod s oversight of distance education programs  especially those offered by proprietary institutions 
in august  dod issued a proposed regulation that would increase oversight of educational programs offered to active duty service members 
the final rule  published december  and effective january   requires all institutions to sign a memorandum of understanding  or mou  by march  the mou outlines certain commitments and agreements between the institution and dod prior to accepting funds under the tuition assistance program 
we have entered into a standard mou with dod 
in addition  in december  the senate help committee released a report entitled benefitting whom for profit education companies and the growth of military educational benefits  which raised questions about the growing share of dod tuition assistance received by proprietary institutions 
in march  the gao published a report entitled dod education benefits increased oversight of tuition assistance program is needed  which offered several recommendations for improving accountability within the tuition assistance program 
in september  the senate subcommittee on federal financial management  government information  federal services  and international security held a hearing focused on the classification of military education benefits under the rule  which requires proprietary institutions to derive at least percent of their revenue from non title iv sources 
some of the panelists suggested that the classification of military benefits as non title iv revenue for purposes of the rule has led some for profit institutions to recruit aggressively and sometimes illegally members of the military in order to ensure compliance with the rule 
senator harkin  chairman of the senate committee on health  education  labor pensions spoke on the senate floor on may  and hosted a press conference on september  encouraging reformation of the rule 
senator harkin has accused for profit institutions of engaging in deceptive marketing and aggressive recruiting in order to enroll veteran and active duty military members 
he has also criticized for profit institutions on the basis of their program withdrawal rates and demanded more accountability for the use of federal funds 
in addition  the president eo  issued april   establishing principles to strengthen oversight  in part  of the dod tuition assistance program requires federal agencies to implement the principles through various actions 
congress may also decide to take action in response to the principles 
we cannot predict the extent to which  or whether  congressional hearings result in legislation or further rulemaking affecting our participation in dod s tuition assistance program or the title iv programs 
members of congress have stated  both in committee hearings and in the help committee report  that congress should revise the rule to count dod tuition assistance and veterans educational benefits toward the limit 
in january  senators harkin and durbin introduced a bill to modify the rule by reducing the threshold to and counting the title iv programs  the dod tuition assistance program  and veterans education benefits programs as sources from which an institution may derive no more than of its revenue 
in february  companion bills were introduced in the us senate and us house of representatives that would modify the rule to count dod tuition assistance and veterans education benefits toward the limit  along with title iv programs 
on may   attorneys general for states called on congress to enact this type of legislation 
we cannot predict the likelihood that congress will amend the rule to count dod tuition assistance and veterans education benefits toward the limit or to lower the ratio to  nor can we predict the likelihood that congress or president obama will not take some other action to limit tuition assistance and veterans education benefits to proprietary institutions 
to the extent that any laws or regulations are adopted that limit or condition the participation of proprietary schools or distance education programs in dod tuition assistance programs or in title iv programs with respect to dod tuition assistance programs  or that limit or condition the amount of tuition assistance for which proprietary schools or distance education programs are eligible  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
our regulatory environment and our reputation may be negatively influenced by the actions of other for profit institutions 
we are one of a number of for profit institutions serving the postsecondary education market 
in recent years  regulatory investigations and civil litigation have been commenced against several companies that own for profit educational institutions 
these investigations and lawsuits have alleged  among other things  deceptive trade practices and noncompliance with department of education regulations 
these allegations have attracted adverse media coverage and have been the subject of federal and state legislative hearings 
broader allegations against the overall for profit school sector may negatively affect public perceptions of for profit educational institutions  including apus 
in addition  in recent years reports on student lending practices of various lending institutions and schools  including for profit schools  and investigations by a number of state attorneys general  congress and governmental agencies have led to adverse media coverage of postsecondary education 
adverse media coverage regarding other companies in the for profit school sector or regarding us directly could damage our reputation  could result in lower enrollments  revenues and operating profit  and could have a negative impact on our stock price 
such allegations could also result in increased scrutiny and regulation by the department of education  congress  accrediting bodies  state legislatures  or other governmental authorities with respect to all for profit institutions  including us 
sequestration could reduce demand by reducing the availability of title iv funds and increasing processing time and could have similar effects on tuition assistance funds 
congressional actions that reduce title iv program funding whether through across the board funding reductions  sequestration or otherwise or materially affect the eligibility of apus or its students to participate in title iv programs would have a material adverse effect on our enrollment  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
on december   president obama signed into law the consolidated appropriations act of  which made several alterations to federal student aid programs authorized under title iv 
also  under the budget control act of  congress must develop legislation to achieve further deficit reduction  and the outcome of this process is uncertain 
the budget control act of and the statutory pay as you go act of each provide for the possibility of automatic across the board reductions in federal spending also known as sequestration as a budgetary enforcement tool 
on january   president obama signed legislation to avoid the so called fiscal cliff 
however  unless congress takes further action  sequestration will begin on march  the house committee on the budget released a report in january stating that programs administered by the department of veterans affairs will be exempt from sequestration 
if sequestration is triggered by either the budget control act of or the statutory pay as you go act of  funding for title iv programs would be affected 
pell grants would be exempt from cuts through fiscal year  but could be subject to sequestration in fiscal year and beyond 
most other federal student aid programs would be subject to across the board cuts to discretionary programs at a rate of approximately 
origination fees for stafford loans and plus loans would increase approximately  to approximately and of the total loan  respectively 
cuts to the department of education federal student aid administration budget could lead to delays in student eligibility determinations and delays in processing and origination of federal student loans 
a reduction in the maximum annual pell grant amount or changes in eligibility could increase student borrowing and make it more difficult for us to comply with other regulatory requirements  such as the cohort default rate regulations 
in addition  the department of education federal student aid administration budget would be reduced by sequestration  which could delay student eligibility determinations and processing of federal student loans 
furthermore  in the event of sequestration  the amounts available under the tuitions assistance programs of the department of defense could also be significantly curtailed or even eliminated  and the time for the various services to process requests for tuition assistance could be lengthened 
these events could make it more difficult for students to obtain funding for an apus education  either in a timely manner or at all  and would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
congress may change the law or reduce funding for title iv programs  which could reduce our student population  revenues and profit margin 
on april   senators kay hagan and tom harkin introduced new legislation that would prohibit colleges and universities from using funds from title iv programs  military tuition assistance  veterans education benefits programs  and other federal educational assistance funds to pay for marketing  advertising  and recruiting 
if a similar bill were introduced in the th congress and enacted  it would significantly affect our ability to identify and attract prospective students 
the higher education act comes up for reauthorization by congress approximately every five to six years 
when congress does not act on complete reauthorization  there are typically amendments and extensions of authorization 
on august   president obama signed the budget control act of  which eliminated direct subsidized loans for graduate and professional students  as of july  the cost of borrowing will increase for graduate students who defer payment of interest while enrolled  which could adversely impact our enrollments 
in addition  there is no assurance that congress will not in the future enact changes that decrease title iv program funds available to students  including students who attend our institution 
any action by congress that significantly reduces funding for title iv programs or the ability of our school or students to participate in these programs would require us to arrange for other sources of financial aid and would materially decrease our enrollment 
such a decrease in enrollment would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
congressional action may also require us to modify our practices in ways that could result in increased administrative and regulatory costs and decreased profit margin 
we are not in a position to predict with certainty whether any legislation will be passed by congress or signed into law in the future 
the reallocation of funding among title iv programs  material changes in the requirements for participation in such programs  or the substitution of materially different title iv programs could reduce the ability of certain students to finance their education at our institution and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
investigations by state attorneys general  congress  and governmental agencies regarding relationships between loan providers and educational institutions and their financial aid officers may result in increased regulatory burdens and costs 
in recent years  the student lending practices of postsecondary educational institutions  financial aid officers  and student loan providers have been subjected to several investigations by state attorneys general  congress  and governmental agencies 
these investigations concern  among other things  possible deceptive practices in the marketing of private student loans and loans provided by lenders pursuant to title iv programs 
the higher education opportunity act  or heoa  contains new requirements pertinent to relationships between lenders and institutions 
in particular  heoa requires institutions to have a code of conduct  with certain specified provisions  pertinent to interactions with lenders of student loans  prohibits certain activities by lenders and guaranty agencies with respect to institutions  and establishes substantive and disclosure requirements for lists of recommended or suggested lenders of federal and private student loans 
in addition  heoa imposes substantive and disclosure obligations on institutions that make available a list of recommended lenders for potential borrowers 
on august   the consumer financial protection bureau submitted a report to the senate committee on banking  housing  and urban affairs  the senate help committee  the house of representatives committee on financial services  and the house of representatives committee on education and the workforce entitled private student loans 
the report contained specific suggestions for congressional action to restructure the student lending experience  including possibly requiring institutions to certify that a student is not eligible for any further federal funds before a private loan may be issued to such student 
on october   the consumer financial protection bureau ombudsman for private student loan matters issued a report containing recommendations for the senate committee on banking  housing  and urban affairs  the senate help committee  the house committee on financial services  the house committee on education and the workforce  the secretary of the treasury  the director of the consumer financial protection bureau  and the secretary of education 
the report addressed potential reforms to student loan servicing and expansion of loan modification and refinancing options 
in addition  on october   the consumer financial protection bureau released a report entitled the next front student loan servicing and the cost to our men and women in uniform 
the report details the challenges that some service members have encountered when utilizing private and federal student loans 
in january  cfpb encouraged institutions of higher education  students  and others to provide information by march  about the financial products and services currently offered to students  and comments on how current and future arrangements between institutions of higher education and financial institutions could be structured in order to promote positive financial decision making among consumers 
we do not know what steps congress or federal agencies may take in response to these reports and whether such actions if any will have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
in addition  state legislators have also passed or may be considering legislation related to relationships between lenders and institutions 
we can neither know nor predict with certainty the effects of such developments 
governmental action may impose increased administrative and regulatory costs and decreased profit margins 
we are subject to sanctions that could be material to our results and damage our reputation if we fail to calculate correctly and return timely title iv program funds for students who withdraw before completing their educational program 
a school participating in title iv programs must calculate correctly the amount of unearned title iv program funds that have been disbursed to students who withdraw from their educational programs before completion and must return those unearned funds in a timely manner  generally within days after the date the school determines that the student has withdrawn 
because we began to participate in title iv programs in and the final regulations published on october  include new rules applicable to return of title iv calculations  we have limited experience complying with these provisions 
furthermore  as discussed above  in the department of education found  in a conclusion with which the company disagrees  that we failed to do so properly with respect to  of title iv funds 
under department of education regulations  late returns of title iv program funds for or more of students sampled in connection with the institution s annual compliance audit constitutes material noncompliance 
if unearned funds are not properly calculated and timely returned  we may have to repay title iv funds  post a letter of credit in favor of the department of education or otherwise be sanctioned by the department of education  which could increase our cost of regulatory compliance and adversely affect our results of operations 
a failure to demonstrate financial responsibility may result in the loss of eligibility by apus to participate in title iv programs or require the posting of a letter of credit in order to maintain eligibility to participate in title iv programs 
to participate in title iv programs  an eligible institution must satisfy specific measures of financial responsibility prescribed by the department of education  or post a letter of credit in favor of the department of education and possibly accept other conditions  such as provisional certification  additional reporting requirements  or regulatory oversight  on its participation in title iv programs 
the department of education may also apply such measures of financial responsibility to the operating company and ownership entities of an eligible institution and  if such measures are not satisfied by the operating company or ownership entities  require the institution to post a letter of credit in favor of the department of education and possibly accept other conditions on its participation in title iv programs 
any obligation to post a letter of credit could increase our costs of regulatory compliance 
if we were unable to secure a letter of credit  we would lose our eligibility to participate in title iv programs 
in addition to the obligation to post a letter of credit under certain circumstances  an institution that is determined by the department of education not to be financially responsible may be transferred from the advance system of payment of title iv funds  which allows the institution to obtain title iv program funds from the department of education prior to making disbursements to students  to cash monitoring status or to the reimbursement system of payment  which requires the institution to make title iv disbursements to students and seek reimbursement from the department of education 
a change in our system of payment could increase our costs of regulatory compliance 
if we fail to demonstrate financial responsibility and thus lose our eligibility to participate in title iv programs  our students would lose access to title iv program funds for use in our institution  which would limit our potential for growth outside the military community and adversely affect our enrollment  revenues and results of operations 
a failure to demonstrate administrative capability may result in the loss of apus eligibility to participate in title iv programs 
department of education regulations specify extensive criteria an institution must satisfy to establish that it has the requisite administrative capability to participate in title iv programs 
see regulation of our business in this annual report for more information on the department of education s regulations on administrative capability 
if an institution fails to satisfy any of these criteria or comply with any other department of education regulations  the department of education may require the repayment of title iv funds  transfer the institution from the advance system of payment of title iv funds to cash monitoring status or to the reimbursement system of payment  place the institution on provisional certification status  or commence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit  suspend or terminate the participation of the institution in title iv programs 
if we are found not to have satisfied the department of education s administrative capability requirements  we could be limited in our access to  or lose  title iv program funding  which would limit our potential for growth outside the military sector and adversely affect our enrollment  revenues  and results of operations 
we have limited experience internally administering our participation in title iv programs and failure to comply with applicable regulations could cause us to lose our eligibility to participate in title iv programs 
we recently determined to terminate our relationship with global financial aid services  inc  or global  which had assisted us with administration of our participation in title iv programs since we began to participate in those programs in  and to administer our participation in title iv programs internally 
to effect this transition  we will require cooperation and on going assistance from global during a period of transition 
to the extent global declines to cooperate with us  or responds to our requests for assistance in a less than timely fashion  we may not be able to effect this transition in a timely and cost efficient manner 
furthermore  we may not realize the expected efficiencies from this transition  and given our lack of experience administering title iv programs on our own  we may not be able to effectively do so 
if our ability to comply with the requirements of title iv programs is effected because of disputes or delays in connection with the transition process or because of problems administering title iv programs on our own  we could be subject to the sanctions discussed in the risk factors above and it could limit our enrollments  revenues  and results of operation 
we may lose eligibility to participate in title iv programs if our student loan default rates are too high  and if we lose that eligibility our future growth could be impaired 
an educational institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all title iv programs if  for three consecutive federal fiscal years  or more of its students who were required to begin repaying their student loans in the relevant federal fiscal year default on their payment by the end of the next federal fiscal year 
in addition  an institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all title iv programs if its default rate exceeds in the most recent federal fiscal year for which default rates have been calculated by the department of education 
heoa modifies the higher education act s default rate provisions 
because we began only recently to enroll students who are participating in the federal student loan programs  we have no historical cohort default rate for federal fiscal year or earlier 
our cohort default rate for federal fiscal years   and are  and  respectively 
beginning with default rate calculations for federal fiscal year  the cohort default rate will be calculated by determining the rate at which borrowers who become subject to their repayment obligation in the relevant federal fiscal year default by the end of the second following federal fiscal year 
the three year cohort default rate 
in september  the department of education began publishing the official three year cohort default rates 
the department of education will publish the three year cohort default rates in addition to the current method of calculating rates described in the paragraph above until the phase in of the three year measurement period is complete 
as of september  only the three year cohort default rates will be applied for purposes of measuring compliance  beginning with the three year cohort default rate for the cohort 
an institution will lose its eligibility to participate in certain title iv programs days after it receives notice from the department of education that its most recent cohort default rate for fiscal year or later is greater than 
in addition  an institution may lose its eligibility to participate in certain title iv programs days after it receives notice from the department of education that its three most recent cohort default rates are each or greater 
our official three year cohort default rate for is 
if our student loan default rates approach the limits detailed above  we may be required to increase our efforts and resources dedicated to improving these default rates 
in addition  because there is a lag between the funding of a student loan and a default thereunder  many of the borrowers who are in default or at risk of default are former students with whom we may have only limited contact 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we would be able to effectively improve our default rates or improve them in a timely manner to meet the requirements for continued participation in title iv funding if we experience a substantial increase in our student loan default rates 
if apus loses its eligibility to participate in title iv programs because of high student loan default rates  our students would no longer be eligible to use title iv program funds in our institution  which would significantly reduce our enrollments and revenues and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
if we undergo a change in ownership and control  the department of education will place us on provisional certification  and the terms of that provisional certification could limit our potential for growth outside the military sector and adversely affect our enrollment  revenues  and results of operations 
department of education regulations provide that a change of control of a publicly traded corporation occurs if there is an event that would obligate the corporation to file a current report on form k with the sec disclosing a change of control or ii the corporation has a stockholder that owns at least of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation and is the largest stockholder of the corporation  and that stockholder ceases to own at least of such stock or ceases to be the largest stockholder 
a significant purchase or disposition of our voting stock could be determined by the department of education to be a change in ownership and control under this standard 
under the higher education act  an institution that undergoes a change in ownership resulting in a change in control loses its eligibility to participate in title iv programs and must apply to the department of education in order to reestablish such eligibility 
during our period of provisional certification  we had to comply with any additional conditions included in our program participation agreement  which included  among other things  limitations on our operations 
our program participation agreement provided that  as a provisionally certified institution  we had to apply for and receive approval by the secretary for any substantial change  including but not limited to establishment of additional locations  an increase in the level of academic offering  and addition of any non degree or short term training program 
the department of education also had authority to review us more closely during our provisional certification 
on july   we received a letter from the department of education notifying us that we are fully recertified to participate in title iv programs through december  future transactions could constitute a change in ownership or control under department of education regulations and could cause the department to place us on provisional certification as require by the law when an institution undergoes a change in ownership and control 
the conditions to provisional certification or closer review by the department of education could impact  among other things  our ability to add educational programs  acquire other schools  or make other significant changes 
in addition  if the department of education were to determine that we were unable to meet our responsibilities while we were provisionally certified  the department could seek to revoke our certification to participate in title iv programs with fewer due process protections than if we were fully certified 
limitations on our operations could  and the loss of our certification to participate in title iv programs would  adversely affect our ability to grow our presence outside the military sector in addition to having adverse effects on our enrollment  revenues  and results of operations 
if regulators do not approve or delay their approval of transactions involving a change of control of our company  our ability to operate could be impaired 
if we or apus experience a change of control under the standards of applicable state education agencies  the department of education  the higher learning commission  or other regulators  we must notify or seek the approval of each relevant regulatory agency 
transactions or events that constitute a change of control include significant acquisitions or dispositions of an institution s common stock and significant changes in the composition of an institution s board of directors 
some of these transactions or events may be beyond our control 
our failure to obtain  or a delay in receiving  approval of any change of control from the west virginia higher education policy commission  the state council of higher education for virginia  the department of education or the higher learning commission could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
our failure to obtain  or a delay in receiving  approval of any change of control from other states in which we are currently licensed or authorized could require us to suspend our activities in that state or otherwise impair our operations 
the potential adverse effects of a change of control could influence future decisions by us and our stockholders regarding the sale  purchase  transfer  issuance  or redemption of our stock 
in addition  the regulatory burdens and risks associated with a change of control also could have an adverse effect on the market price of your shares 
our business could be harmed if we experience a disruption in our ability to receive federal funding 
we collected the substantial majority of our fiscal year total consolidated net revenue from federal government funding sources  such as title iv financial aid program funds  including from federal student loans under the federal direct loan program  dod tuition benefits and veterans education benefits 
any processing disruptions by the us department of education  dod or the department of veterans affairs may impact our students ability to obtain student loans or tuition benefits  respectively  on a timely basis 
if we experience a disruption in our ability to process student loans through the direct loan program or to process tuition benefits for military students through dod because of administrative challenges on our part or the inability of the department of education  dod or department of veterans affairs to process the volume of direct loans  military tuition benefits or veterans benefits  respectively  on a timely basis  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely and materially affected 
risks related to owning our common stock the price of our common stock may be volatile  and as a result returns on an investment in our common stock may be volatile 
we completed our initial public offering in november for a significant portion of the time since our initial public offering  we have had relatively limited public float  and trading in our common stock has also been limited and  at times  volatile 
an active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained  and the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially 
the price of the common stock may fluctuate as a result of price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time  significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of comparable companies  actual or anticipated changes in our earnings  enrollments or net course registrations  or fluctuations in our operating results or in the expectations of securities analysts  the actual  anticipated or perceived impact of changes in government policies  laws and regulations  or similar changes made by accrediting bodies  the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock  general economic conditions and trends  catastrophic events  sales of large blocks of our stock  or recruitment or departure of key personnel 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
because of the potential volatility of our stock price  we may become the target of securities litigation in the future 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources from our business 
seasonal and other fluctuations in our results of operations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
our results in any quarter may not indicate the results we may achieve in any subsequent quarter or for the full year 
our revenues and operating results normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal or other variations in our enrollments 
student population varies as a result of new enrollments  graduations  student attrition  the success of our marketing programs and other reasons that we cannot always anticipate 
while our number of enrolled students has grown in each sequential quarter over the past three years  the number of enrolled students has been proportionally greatest in the fourth quarter of each respective year 
a significant portion of our general and administrative expenses do not vary proportionately with fluctuations in revenues 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results to continue as a result of seasonal enrollment patterns 
such patterns may change  however  as a result of new program introductions and increased enrollments of students  or as a result of other factors we cannot anticipate 
these fluctuations may result in volatility in our results of operations and or have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
if securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade their evaluations of our stock  the price of our stock could decline 
the trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business 
if one or more of the analysts covering us downgrade their estimates or evaluations of our stock  the price of our stock could decline 
if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company  we could lose visibility in the market for our stock  which in turn could cause our stock price to decline

overview american public education  inc is a provider of online postsecondary education with an emphasis on the needs of the military and public service communities 
we operate through two universities  american military university  or amu  and american public university  or apu  which together constitute the american public university system  or apus 
we were founded as american military university  inc in and began offering graduate courses in january following accreditation by the accrediting commission of the distance education and training council  or detc  a national accrediting agency  in  american military university began offering undergraduate programs primarily directed to members of the armed forces 
over time  american military university diversified its educational offerings in response to demand by military students for post military career preparation 
with its expanded program offerings  american military university extended its outreach to the greater public service community  primarily police  fire  emergency management personnel and national security professionals 
in  we reorganized into a holding company structure  with american public education  inc serving as the holding company of apus  which operates our two universities  amu and apu 
our university system achieved accreditation in may with the higher learning commission of the north central association of colleges and schools  a regional accrediting agency  and became eligible for federal student aid programs under title iv for classes beginning in november our course enrollments  or net course registrations  representing the aggregate number of classes in which students remain enrolled after the date by which they may drop the course without cost and combining one credit lab courses with their related three credit course for the years ended december  and  increased at a compound annual growth rate cagr of from to over that same time  total revenue increased at a cagr of  from million in to million in we believe achieving regional accreditation in may  gaining access to title iv programs beginning with classes that started in november  and the variety and affordability of our programs have been some of the factors driving growth 
net course registrations increased by in over  our revenue increased from million to million  or by  over the same time period  while operating margins decreased to from over the same time period 
net course registrations increased by in over  our revenue increased from million to million  or by  over the same time period and operating margins decreased to from over the same time period 
while we have experienced substantial growth in recent periods  you should not rely on the results of any prior periods as an indication of our future growth in adjusted net course registrations or revenue as we do not expect that our historical growth rates are sustainable 
similarly  you should not rely on our operating margins in any prior periods as an indication of our future operating margins 
since gaining access to title iv programs  a significant portion of our growth is attributable to students using title iv programs 
in addition to the positive impact this has had on our growth in net registrations and revenues  this has had other effects on our business and results of operations  including a change to the mix of students we serve 
this has resulted  and will continue to result  in a need to provide a greater level of services to our students 
our costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue have increased due in part to increased general and administrative expenses related to this shift in student mix and primarily attributable to an increase in expenditures for financial aid processing fees  expenditures for technology required to support the increase in civilian students  and increased bad debt primarily associated with our civilian students 
in order to support the number of students we now have and to plan for the future  we also expect that we will make significant investments in our technology infrastructure and financial aid processing capabilities  which from time to time  including in  will result in an increased level of spending  not all of which can be capitalized 
the change to our student mix is also correlated to limitations we have encountered on our ability to make long range forecasts with respect to student enrollments 
we have had more difficulty forecasting the number of students who will enroll  we have noticed a decrease in the predictability of the rate at which we convert leads into enrolled students  and we have had more difficulty attracting students that will perform well over the long term  all of which we attribute in part to the growth of civilian students  particularly the growth of civilian students from outside of public service communities 
in addition to the above factors related to title iv programs and civilian students  in we observed that some students enroll or attempt to enroll solely to obtain title iv funds  and some students who might not otherwise pursue a degree or certificate are attracted to enroll because of the availability of title iv funds and economic hardships resulting from today s economic climate 
we believe these students may be more likely than other students to cease pursuing a degree or certificate due to other factors  such as becoming employed or not having the level of commitment necessary to complete successfully the required coursework 
as a result  the growth in our enrollments in reflected some students who will not persist as students 
we have also been the target of fraudulent activities by outside parties with respect to student enrollment and title iv programs  and as we continue to grow we may be susceptible to an increased risk of such activities 
we are not able to estimate the number of students who fall into these enrollment categories  and our ability to estimate the impact on our enrollments over time is limited  as is our ability to estimate any additional impact that this could have on our exposure to bad debt or the number of our students who default on their title iv student loans 
each of the budget control act of and the statutory pay as you go act of provide for the possibility of automatic across the board reductions in federal spending also known as sequestration as a budgetary enforcement tool 
the house committee on the budget released a report in january stating that programs administered by the department of veterans affairs will be exempt from sequestration 
however  if sequestration is triggered  funding for title iv programs would be affected 
pell grants would be exempt from cuts through fiscal year  but could be subject to sequestration in fiscal year and beyond 
most other federal student aid programs would be subject to across the board cuts to discretionary programs at a rate of approximately 
origination fees for stafford loans and plus loans would increase approximately  to approximately and of the total loan  respectively 
cuts to the department of education federal student aid administration budget could lead to delays in student eligibility determinations and delays in processing and origination of federal student loans 
a reduction in the maximum annual pell grant amount or changes in eligibility could increase student borrowing and make it more difficult for us to comply with other regulatory requirements  such as the cohort default rate regulations 
in addition  the department of education federal student aid administration budget would be reduced by sequestration  which could delay student eligibility determinations and processing of federal student loans 
as a result of sequestration the amounts available under the tuition assistance programs of the department of defense could also be significantly curtailed or even eliminated  and the time for the various services to process requests for tuition assistance could be lengthened 
these events could make it more difficult for students to obtain funding for an apus education  either in a timely manner or at all  and would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
our key financial results metrics revenues in reviewing our revenues we consider the following components net course registrations  tuition we charge  tuition net of scholarships  and other fees 
net course registrations 
for financial reporting and analysis purposes  we measure our student body in terms of aggregate course enrollments  or net course registrations 
net course registrations represent the aggregate number of classes in which students remain enrolled after the date by which they may drop the course without cost and combining one credit lab courses with their related three credit courses 
because we recognize revenues over the length of a course  net course registrations in a financial reporting period do not correlate directly with revenues for that period because revenues recognized from courses are not necessarily recognized in the financial reporting period in which the course registrations occur 
for example  revenues in a quarter reflect a portion of the revenue from courses that began in a prior quarter and continued into the quarter  all revenue from courses that began and ended in the quarter  and a portion of the revenue from courses that began but did not end in the quarter 
we believe our curriculum is directly relevant to federal  state and local law enforcement and other first responders  but historically this market was limited to us because  outside the federal government  only a few agencies or departments have the tuition reimbursement plans critical to fund continuing adult education 
in recent years  in part because our students can access title iv programs  we have been increasing our focus on these markets 
title iv programs require participating students to take more courses per semester than students participating in department of defense  or dod  tuition assistance programs 
as a result  we expect that our increased focus on markets that utilize title iv programs may cause the average number of courses per student per semester to increase 
tuition 
providing affordable programs is an important element of our strategy for growth 
since  we have not raised undergraduate tuition and have only increased graduate tuition by modest amounts in  and we set our undergraduate tuition costs within the dod ceilings 
using the dod tuition ceiling as a benchmark keeps our tuition in line with four year public university  in state rates for undergraduates 
net tuition 
tuition revenues vary from period to period based on the aggregate number of students attending classes and the number of classes they are attending during the period 
tuition revenue is adjusted to reflect amounts for students who withdraw from a course in the month the withdrawal occurs 
we also provide scholarships to certain students to assist them financially and to promote their registration 
the cost of these scholarships is netted against tuition revenue in the period incurred for purposes of establishing net tuition revenue and typically represents less than of revenues 
other fees 
other fees include charges for transcript credit evaluation  which includes assistance in securing official transcripts on behalf of the student in addition to evaluating transcripts for transfer credit 
students also are charged withdrawal  graduation  late registration  transcript request and comprehensive examination fees  when applicable 
in accordance with emerging issues tasks force issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc topic  other fees also includes book purchase commissions we receive for graduate student book purchases and ancillary supply purchases students make directly from our preferred book vendor 
a technology fee of per course was also implemented for course registrations beginning after september  the technology fee is earned over the length of the course 
however  apus provides a grant to cover the fee for active duty military  national guard and reserve personnel  and for anyone using dod tuition assistance benefits 
the grant also covers the fee for students using veterans education benefits 
costs and expenses we categorize our costs and expenses as i instructional costs and services  ii selling and promotional  iii general and administrative  and iv depreciation and amortization 
instructional costs and services 
instructional costs and services are expenses directly attributable to the educational services we provide our students 
this expense category includes salaries and benefits for full time faculty  administrators and academic advisors  and costs associated with adjunct faculty 
instructional pay for adjunct faculty is primarily dependent on the number of students taught 
instructional costs and services expenses also include costs for educational supplies such as books  costs associated with academic records and graduation  and other university services such as evaluating transcripts 
substantially all undergraduate students receive their textbooks through our book grant program 
over the course of a complete bachelor s degree program  this represents a potential average student savings of approximately  when compared to four year public colleges according to the college board study  annual survey of colleges report from in connection with our book grant program  we have been working to reduce the overall cost of books per course 
graduate students may order and pay for their books through the contracted vendor from which we purchase the undergraduate book grant program books or they can purchase books from a vendor of their choice 
selling and promotional 
selling and promotional expenses include salaries and benefits of personnel engaged in recruitment and promotion  as well as costs associated with advertising and the production of marketing materials related to new enrollments and current students 
our selling and promotional expenses are generally affected by the cost of advertising media  the efficiency of our selling efforts  salaries and benefits for our selling and admissions personnel  and the number of advertising initiatives for new and existing academic programs 
the availability of title iv program funds to our students have increased our marketability in non military markets  but the more competitive nature of these markets has caused our student acquisition costs to increase 
as we continue to grow in size and continue to focus on students using title iv funds outside of public service communities  this trend may continue and our student acquisition costs may continue to increase due to our marketing the apu brand and our efforts to realize a greater number of civilian student net registrations 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include salaries and benefits of employees engaged in corporate management  finance  information technology  human resources  facilities  compliance and other corporate functions 
in addition  the cost of renting and maintaining our facilities  technology expenses  and costs for professional services are included in general and administrative costs 
general and administrative expenses also include bad debt expense 
depreciation and amortization 
we incur depreciation and amortization expenses for costs related to the capitalization of property  equipment  software and program development on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
interest income  net interest income  net consists primarily of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents  net of any interest expense 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
during the preparation of these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of long lived assets  contingencies  income taxes and stock based compensation expense 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and the impact of such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 
a summary of our critical accounting policies follows revenue recognition 
we record all tuition as deferred revenue when students begin a class 
at the beginning of each class  revenue is recognized on a pro rata basis over the period of the class  which is either eight or sixteen weeks 
this results in our balance sheet including future revenues that have not yet been earned as deferred revenue for classes that are in progress 
students who request to be placed on program hold are required to complete or withdraw from the courses prior to being placed on hold 
other revenue includes charges for transcript credit evaluation  which includes assistance in securing official transcripts on behalf of the student in addition to evaluating transcripts for transfer credit 
students also are charged withdrawal  graduation  late registration  transcript request and comprehensive examination fees  when applicable 
in accordance with fasb asc topic  accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor  other fees also includes book purchase commissions we receive for graduate student book purchases and ancillary supply purchases students make directly from our preferred book vendor 
tuition revenues vary from period to period based on the number of net course registrations 
students may remit tuition payments through the online registration process at any time or they may elect various payment options  including payments by sponsors  alternative loans  financial aid  or the dod tuition assistance program that remits payments directly to us 
these other payment options can delay the receipt of payment up until the class starts or longer  resulting in the recording of a receivable from the student and deferred revenue at the beginning of each session 
the company refunds of tuition for courses that are dropped by students before the conclusion of the first seven days of a course 
because courses begin the first monday of every month and penalty free drops occur by the second monday of every month  the company does not recognize revenue for dropped courses 
after a course begins and if a student does not drop their course  the following refund policy is used week course tuition refund schedule withdrawal request date tuition refund percentage before or during week during week during weeks and during weeks through no refund week course tuition refund schedule withdrawal request date tuition refund percentage before or during week during week during weeks and during weeks through during weeks through no refund accounts receivable 
course registrations are recorded as deferred revenue and accounts receivable at the time students begin a course 
students may remit tuition payments through the online registration process at any time or they may elect various payment options  which can delay the receipt of payment up until the class starts or longer 
these other payment options include payments by sponsors  alternative loans  financial aid  or a tuition assistance program that remits payments directly to us 
when a student remits payment after a class has begun  accounts receivable is reduced 
if payment is made prior to the start of class  the payment is recorded as a student deposit and the student is provided access to the classroom when classes start 
if one of the various other payment options are confirmed as secured  the student is provided access to the classroom 
if no receipt is confirmed or payment option secured  the student will be dropped from the class 
therefore  billed amounts represent invoices that have been prepared and sent to students or their sponsor  lender  financial aid  or tuition assistance program according to the billing terms agreed upon in advance 
the dod tuition assistance program is billed on a course by course basis when a student starts class  whereas federal financial aid programs are billed based on the classes included in a student s semester 
billed accounts receivable are considered past due if the invoice has been outstanding more than days 
the provision for doubtful accounts is based on management s evaluation of the status of existing accounts receivable 
recoveries of receivables previously written off are recorded when received 
we do not charge interest on our past due accounts receivable 
property and equipment 
property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation and amortization are calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
our partnership at a distance  or pad  is a customized student information and services system  that manages admissions  online orientation  course registrations  tuition payments  grade reporting  progress toward degrees  and various other functions 
costs associated with the project have been capitalized in accordance with fasb asc topic  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  and classified as property and equipment 
these costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of five years 
the company capitalizes the costs for program development 
costs are transferred to property and equipment upon completion of each program and amortized over an estimated life not to exceed three years 
investment 
on september   we made a million or approximately investment in preferred stock of nwhw holdings  inc  which in turn acquired new horizons worldwide  inc  or new horizons 
new horizons is a global it training company operating over locations around the world through franchise arrangements in states and countries 
in connection with the investment  we are is entitled to certain rights  including right to representation on the board of directors of nwhw holdings 
we recorded the investment under the equity method and will recognize our share of earnings or losses in the investee in the periods for which they are reported with a corresponding adjustment in the carrying amount of the investment 
note receivable 
in connection with the company minority investment in nwhw holdings  inc  the company extended million in credit to new horizons in exchange for a subordinated note 
the note matures on september  with monthly interest payments of per annum during the first five years of the note and interest payments of per annum in the sixth year 
we evaluate the loan receivable by analyzing the borrower creditworthiness  cash flows and financial status  and the condition and estimated value of the collateral 
we consider a loan to be impaired when  based upon current information and events  we believe it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
income taxes 
deferred taxes are determined using the liability method  whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
as those differences reverse  they will enter into the determination of future taxable income 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
stock based compensation 
prior to  we used a mix of stock options and restricted stock  but in we did not issue stock options 
we apply fasb asc topic  share based payment  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for stock based payment awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options 
we have selected the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the stock option awards on the date of grant 
our determination of the fair value of these stock option awards was affected by the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant  as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
prior to  we calculated the expected term of stock option awards using the simplified method as defined by security and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletins no 
and because we lacked historical data and were unable to make reasonable expectations regarding the future 
we also estimate forfeitures of share based awards at the time of grant and revise such estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from original projections 
we make assumptions with respect to expected stock price volatility based on the average historical volatility of peers with similar attributes 
in addition  we determine the risk free interest rate by selecting the us treasury five year constant maturity  quoted on an investment basis in effect at the time of grant for that business day 
estimates of fair value are subjective and are not intended to predict actual future events  and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made under fasb topic recent accounting pronouncements there have been no applicable announcements since our last filing
