executive overview financial performance review in  we reported net income of million  or per common share  an increase of million compared with see table 
the increase primarily reflected a million  or  increase in noninterest income and an million  or  increase in net interest income 
this was partially offset by a million  or  increase in noninterest expense 
despite the challenging economic and extended low interest rate environment combined with impacts of government mandated reductions in fee income during  return on average total assets increased to  compared with in results from our strategic business investments and ocr sales approach continued in also  see significant items influencing financial performance comparisons within the discussion of results of operations 
fully taxable equivalent net interest income was billion in  an increase of million  or  compared with average earning assets increased billion  or  including a billion  or  increase in total loans and leases and a billion increase in loans held for sale 
this reflected benefits from our strategic c i initiatives focusing on the equipment finance  dealer floorplan  large corporate  and middle market segments 
this increase was partially offset by a decline in our automobile loans  reflecting the impact of our continued program of securitization and sale of such loans 
additionally  our cre portfolio declined  reflecting continued runoff of the noncore portfolio 
average core deposits grew billion  or  reflecting our consumer household and commercial relationship growth 
this growth continued even as we focused on fundamentally changing our deposit mix and reducing the overall cost of funds 
the net interest margin increased basis points to from 
the increase reflected the positive impact of a basis point decline in total deposit costs that was partially offset by a basis point decline in the yield on earning assets and a basis point decrease related to non deposit funding and other items 

table of contents noninterest income was billion in  a increase compared with this included a million  or  increase in mortgage banking income  a million  or  increase in gain on sale of loans  an million  or  increase in service charges on deposit accounts  an million  or  increase in capital market fees  and an million bargain purchase gain related to the acquisition of fidelity bank 
these positive impacts were partially offset by a million  or  decrease in electronic banking income  which was negatively impacted by over million from the durbin amendment  and a million  or  decrease in other income reflecting a million  or  decrease in automobile operating lease income 
this year s results showed the continued benefit of our investments and our differentiated strategy 
these investments  combined with adding over  consumer households  a increase  and  commercial relationships  a increase  has allowed us to grow revenue and pretax income by more than million and million  respectively 
noninterest expense was billion in  a increase compared with this included a million  or  increase in personnel costs primarily reflecting an increase in the number of full time equivalent employees as well as higher incentive based compensation and a million  or  increase in equipment expense  primarily reflecting the implementation of strategic initiatives  including opening  or  net new branches 
these increases were offset partially by a million  or  decrease in deposit and other insurance expense 
the current year results also included million of noninterest expense related to the fidelity acquisition  which closed on march  credit quality performance continued to show improvement as both our nals and ncos declined and coverage ratios increased 
compared with the prior year  nals declined 
ncos were million  or of average total loans and leases  down from million  or in of the current year s ncos  million related to regulatory guidance requiring consumer loans discharged under chapter bankruptcy to be charged down to collateral value 
the acl as a percentage of loans and leases was  down from at december  and our acl as a percentage of total nals increased to from 
the level of criticized commercial loans also declined billion  or  from last year 
the provision for credit losses declined million  or  from at december   our regulatory tier common risk based capital ratio was  up from at december   and our tangible common equity ratio increased to from over this same period 
the regulatory tier risk based capital ratio at december   was  down from  at december  this decline reflected the redemption of million of trust preferred securities and the repurchase of million common shares at an average price of per share 
reinvesting excess capital to grow the business organically remains our first priority 
importantly  through dividends and share repurchases  we have the flexibility  subject to market conditions and regulatory approval  to return a meaningful amount of our earnings to our shareholders 
we continue to evaluate other capital actions 
as we have shown over the last several years  we will continue to maintain a high level of discipline when considering mergers and acquisitions 
business overview general our general business objectives are grow net interest income and fee income  increase cross sell and share of wallet across all business segments  improve efficiency ratio  continue to strengthen risk management  including sustained improvements in credit metrics  and maintain strong capital and liquidity positions 
we were pleased with the financial results in  which reflected steady growth in a number of key areas including loans  deposits  and customer relationships as well as improved profitability 
this growth has occurred in a challenging economic and regulatory environment 
it demonstrates the continued benefits from successfully executing our long term strategic plan  including the investments we have made during the previous three years 
those investments added over million of pretax income during and we expect that benefit to grow as those investments continue to mature 
while some businesses are hesitant to invest given the current uncertainty in the economy  we believe our differentiated approach to banking  combined with investing in our franchise through enhanced products and services  will drive growth and improvement of our long term profitability 
as is the nature of a mature industry with arguably overcapacity  we continue to face strong competition from other banks and financial service firms in our markets 
to address these challenges  the cornerstone of our strategy has been to invest in the franchise in order to grow our market share and share of wallet 
in this regard  our ocr methodology continued to deliver strong success in consumer checking account households grew  and our cross sell performance continued to improve 
at the end of the year  of our consumer checking account households utilized over four products 
this compared with a year earlier 
growth in commercial relationships was in at the end of the year  of our commercial relationships used over four products or services  up from a year earlier 
our fair play philosophy  combined with continued ocr success  while positively impacting results  also positions us for better long term performance 

table of contents economy we continue to see positive trends within our midwest markets relative to the broader united states 
nevertheless  broad based customer sentiment began to change in late  due to increased concerns regarding the us economy 
while some businesses are hesitant to invest given the current uncertainty in the economy  we believe our differentiated approach to banking  combined with investing in our franchise through enhanced products and services  will drive growth and improvement of our long term profitability 
generally  our footprint large metropolitan statistical areas msa unemployment rates were below the national average as of november in addition  fhfa housing prices were up in the third quarter relative to the same quarter of last year in all of our footprint states  except pennsylvania  which was essentially unchanged 
strong affordability and continued economic growth should support continued housing recovery in  as long as risks to the overall us economy are contained 
legislative and regulatory regulatory reforms continue to be adopted which impose additional restrictions on current business practices 
recent actions affecting us include the banking regulators basel iii proposal and deferral  frb and occ capital plans and stress testing rules  and cfpb rules governing consumer mortgage lending 
a comprehensive discussion of legislative and regulatory matters can be found in the regulatory matters section included in item of this form k 
expectations we expect to continue seeing the strong growth of the midwest economy relative to the broader united states 
however  business sentiment continues to be negatively influenced by the uncertainty in washington and its direct impact on the us economy 
we remain optimistic that when solutions are in place  the strength of the midwest and the soundness of our strategy will continue to drive growth 
net interest income is expected to modestly grow over the course of  after experiencing its usual first quarter seasonal decline  as we anticipate an increase in total loans  excluding the impact of any future loan securitizations 
however  those benefits to net interest income are expected to be mostly offset by downward pressure on our net interest margin 
the net interest margin is not expected to fall below the mid s due to continued deposit re pricing and mix shift opportunities  while maintaining a disciplined approach to loan pricing 
the c i portfolio is expected to continue to see growth in  although we expect growth will be more heavily weighted to the back half of the year when we expect economic uncertainty driven by washington to be resolved 
our c i sales pipeline remains robust with much of this reflecting the positive impact from our strategic initiatives  focused ocr sales process  and continued support of middle market and small business lending in the midwest 
while on balance sheet exposure is expected to increase  we will continue to evaluate the use of automobile loan securitizations due to our expectation of continued strong levels of originations and anticipate two securitizations in residential mortgages and home equity loan balances are expected to increase modestly 
cre loans likely will experience declines from current levels but are expected to remain in the to billion range 
excluding potential future automobile loan securitizations  we anticipate the increase in total loans will modestly outpace growth in total deposits 
this reflects our continued focus on the overall cost of funds  the continued shift towards low and no cost demand deposits and money market deposit accounts  and a reduction in balances with several larger relationships 
noninterest income over the course of  excluding the impact of any automobile loan sales  any net msr impact  and typical first quarter seasonality  is expected to be relatively stable at current levels 
the anticipated slowdown in mortgage banking activity is expected to be offset by continued growth in new customers  increased contribution from higher cross sell  and the continued maturation of our previous strategic investments 
noninterest expense continued to run at levels above our long term expectations relative to revenue 
in response to changes in our economic outlook  we have moderated the pace and size of our planned investments in order to drive positive operating leverage in credit quality is expected to experience improvement  and ncos should approach normalized levels by the end of the level of provision for credit losses in was at the low end of our long term expectation  and we expect some quarterly volatility within each of the loan categories given the absolute low level of the provision for credit losses and the uncertain and uneven nature of the economic recovery

significant items definition of significant items from time to time  revenue  expenses  or taxes  are impacted by items judged by us to be outside of ordinary banking activities and or by items that  while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities  are so unusually large that their outsized impact is believed by us at that time to be infrequent or short term in nature 
we refer to such items as significant items 
most often  these significant items result from factors originating outside the company  eg  regulatory actions assessments  windfall gains  changes in accounting principles  one time tax assessments refunds  litigation actions  etc 
in other cases they may result from our decisions associated with significant corporate actions out of the ordinary course of business  eg  merger restructuring charges  recapitalization actions  goodwill impairment  etc 
even though certain revenue and expense items are naturally subject to more volatility than others due to changes in market and economic environment conditions  as a general rule volatility alone does not define a significant item 
for example  changes in the provision for credit losses  gains losses from investment activities  asset valuation writedowns  etc  reflect ordinary banking activities and are  therefore  typically excluded from consideration as a significant item 
management believes the disclosure of significant items in current and prior period results aids analysts investors in better understanding corporate performance and trends so that they can ascertain which of such items  if any  they may wish to include exclude from their analysis of the company s performance ie  within the context of determining how that performance differed from their expectations  as well as how  if at all  to adjust their estimates of future performance accordingly 
to this end  management has adopted a practice of listing significant items in its external disclosure documents eg  earnings press releases  quarterly performance discussions  investor presentations  forms q and k 
significant items for any particular period are not intended to be a complete list of items that may materially impact current or future period performance 
significant items influencing financial performance comparisons earnings comparisons among the three years ended december    and were impacted by a number of significant items summarized below

net interest income average balance sheet our primary source of revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between interest income from earning assets primarily loans  securities  and direct financing leases  and interest expense of funding sources primarily interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
earning asset balances and related funding sources  as well as changes in the levels of interest rates  impact net interest income 
the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid for interest bearing liabilities is the net interest spread 
noninterest bearing sources of funds  such as demand deposits and shareholders equity  also support earning assets 
the impact of the noninterest bearing sources of funds  often referred to as free funds  is captured in the net interest margin  which is calculated as net interest income divided by average earning assets 
both the net interest margin and net interest spread are presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis  which means that tax free interest income has been adjusted to a pretax equivalent income  assuming a tax rate 
the following table shows changes in fully taxable equivalent interest income  interest expense  and net interest income due to volume and rate variances for major categories of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

versus the provision for income taxes was million for compared with a provision for income taxes of million in both years included the benefits from tax exempt income  tax advantaged investments  and general business credits 
in prior periods  we established a full valuation allowance against state deferred tax assets and state net operating loss carryforwards based on the uncertainty of forecasted state taxable income expected in applicable jurisdictions in order to utilize the state deferred tax asset and net operating loss carryforwards 
based on current analysis of both positive and negative evidence and projected forecasted state taxable income  we believe that it is more likely than not that a portion of the state deferred tax asset and state net operating loss carryforwards will be realized 
as a result of this analysis  a net million reduction in the provision for income taxes was recorded 
at december   a valuation allowance of million remained for certain state deferred tax assets and state net operating loss carryforwards totaling million that are not expected to be realized within the carryforward periods 
at december   we had a net deferred tax asset of million 
based on both positive and negative evidence and our level of forecasted future taxable income  we determined that no impairment existed to the net deferred tax asset at december  for regulatory capital purposes  there was no disallowed net deferred tax asset at december   compared to a total disallowed net deferred tax asset of million at december  we file income tax returns with the irs and various state  city  and foreign jurisdictions 
federal income tax audits have been completed for tax years through we have appealed certain proposed adjustments resulting from the irs examination of our and tax returns 
in addition  we will appeal certain proposed adjustments resulting from the irs examination of our and tax returns 
we believe our positions related to such proposed adjustments are correct and supported by applicable statutes  regulations  and judicial authority  and intend to vigorously defend them 
during  we entered into discussions with the appeals division of the irs for the and tax returns 
it is possible the ultimate resolution of the proposed adjustments  if unfavorable  may be material to the results of operations in the period it occurs 
nevertheless  although no assurances can be given  we believe that the resolution of these examinations will not  individually or in the aggregate  have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position 
various state and other jurisdictions remain open to examination  including kentucky  indiana  michigan  pennsylvania  west virginia and illinois 
versus the provision for income taxes was million for compared with a provision of million in both years included the benefits from tax exempt income  tax advantaged investments  and general business credits

during  a million net tax benefit was recognized  primarily reflecting the increase in the net deferred tax asset relating to the assets acquired from the march  franklin restructuring 
risk management and capital risk awareness  identification and assessment  reporting  and active management are key elements in overall risk management 
we manage risk to an aggregate moderate to low risk profile through a control framework and by monitoring and responding to identified potential risks 
controls include  among others  effective segregation of duties  access  authorization and reconciliation procedures  as well as staff education and a disciplined assessment process 
we identify primary risks  and the sources of those risks  within each business unit 
we utilize risk and control self assessments rcsa to identify exposure risks 
through this rcsa process  we continually assess the effectiveness of controls associated with the identified risks  regularly monitor risk profiles and material exposure to losses  and identify stress events and scenarios to which we may be exposed 
our chief risk officer is responsible for ensuring that appropriate systems of controls are in place for managing and monitoring risk across the company 
potential risk concerns are shared with the risk management committee  risk oversight committee  and the board of directors  as appropriate 
our internal audit department performs on going independent reviews of the risk management process and ensures the adequacy of documentation 
the results of these reviews are reported regularly to the audit committee and board of directors 

table of contents we believe our primary risk exposures are credit  market  liquidity  operational  and compliance oriented 
credit risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in a counterparty s ability to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms 
market risk represents the risk of loss due to changes in the market value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates  and equity prices 
liquidity risk arises from the possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current or future commitments resulting from external macro market issues  investor and customer perception of financial strength  and events unrelated to us  such as war  terrorism  or financial institution market specific issues 
in addition  the mix and maturity structure of huntington s balance sheet  amount of on hand cash and unencumbered securities and the availability of contingent sources of funding  can have an impact on huntington s ability to satisfy current or future funding commitments 
we manage liquidity risk at both the bank and the parent company 
operational risk arises from our inherent day to day operations that could result in losses due to human error  inadequate or failed internal systems and controls  and external events 
compliance risk exposes us to money penalties  enforcement actions or other sanctions as a result of nonconformance with laws  rules  and regulations that apply to the financial services industry 
some of the more significant processes used to manage and control credit  market  liquidity  operational  and compliance risks are described in the following paragraphs 
credit risk credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a counterparty is not able to meet the agreed upon terms of the financial obligation 
the majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities  as the acceptance and management of credit risk is central to profitable lending 
we also have credit risk associated with our afs securities portfolio see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing  asset and liability management  mortgage banking  and for trading activities 
while there is credit risk associated with derivative activity  we believe this exposure is minimal 
we continue to focus on the identification  monitoring  and managing of our credit risk 
in addition to the traditional credit risk mitigation strategies of credit policies and processes  market risk management activities  and portfolio diversification  we use additional quantitative measurement capabilities utilizing external data sources  enhanced use of modeling technology  and internal stress testing processes 
our portfolio management resources demonstrate our commitment to maintaining an aggregate moderate to low risk profile 
in our efforts to continue to identify risk mitigation techniques  we have focused on product design features  origination policies  and treatment strategies for delinquent or stressed borrowers 
the maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers 
all authority to grant commitments is delegated through the independent credit administration function and is closely monitored and regularly updated 
concentration risk is managed through limits on loan type  geography  industry  and loan quality factors 
we focus predominantly on extending credit to retail and commercial customers with existing or expandable relationships within our primary banking markets  although we will consider lending opportunities outside our primary markets if we believe the associated risks are acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives 
although we offer a broad set of products  we continue to develop new lending products and opportunities 
each of these new products and opportunities goes through a rigorous development and approval process prior to implementation to ensure our overall objective of maintaining an aggregate moderate to low risk portfolio profile 
the checks and balances in the credit process and the independence of the credit administration and risk management functions are designed to appropriately assess and sanction the level of credit risk being accepted  facilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they occur  and to provide for effective problem asset management and resolution 
for example  we do not extend additional credit to delinquent borrowers except in certain circumstances that substantially improve our overall repayment or collateral coverage position 
to that end  we continue to expand resources in our risk management areas 
although credit quality improved in  the weak residential real estate market and us economy continued to negatively impact us and the financial services industry as a whole 
we continued to experience higher than historical levels of delinquencies and ncos in our loan portfolios 
the performance metrics associated with the cre  residential mortgage  and home equity portfolios continued to be the most significantly impacted portfolios as real estate prices remain substantially lower than pre additionally  continued high unemployment  along with other economic conditions  throughout slowed full recovery from the us recession 
loan and lease credit exposure mix at december   our loans and leases totaled billion  representing a billion  or  increase compared to billion at december   primarily reflecting growth in the c i portfolio  partially offset by a decline in the cre portfolio reflecting the continued runoff in the noncore portfolio 
the c i loan increase included the impacts related to a continuation of the growth in high quality loans originated over recent quarters and the purchase of a portfolio of high quality municipal equipment leases 
additionally  the fdic assisted fidelity acquisition resulted in the addition of million of loans 

table of contents total commercial loans were billion at december   and represented of our total loan and lease credit exposure 
our commercial loan portfolio is diversified along product type  customer size  and geography within our footprint  and is comprised of the following see commercial credit discussion c i loans c i loans and leases are made to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs  equipment purchases  or other projects 
the majority of these borrowers are customers doing business within our geographic regions 
c i loans and leases are generally underwritten individually and secured with the assets of the company and or the personal guarantee of the business owners 
the financing of owner occupied facilities is considered a c i loan even though there is improved real estate as collateral 
this treatment is a result of the credit decision process  which focuses on cash flow from operations of the business to repay the debt 
the operation  sale  rental  or refinancing of the real estate is not considered the primary repayment source for these types of loans 
as we expand our c i portfolio  we have developed a vertical strategy to ensure that new products or lending types are embedded within the structured  centralized commercial lending area with designated experienced credit officers 
cre loans cre loans consist of loans for income producing real estate properties  real estate investment trusts  and real estate developers 
we mitigate our risk on these loans by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount and underwriting the loan with projected cash flow in excess of the debt service requirement 
these loans are made to finance properties such as apartment buildings  office and industrial buildings  and retail shopping centers  and are repaid through cash flows related to the operation  sale  or refinance of the property 
construction cre loans construction cre loans are loans to individuals  companies  or developers used for the construction of a commercial or residential property for which repayment will be generated by the sale or permanent financing of the property 
our construction cre portfolio primarily consists of retail  residential land  single family  and condominiums  office  and warehouse project types 
generally  these loans are for construction projects that have been presold or preleased  or have secured permanent financing  as well as loans to real estate companies with significant equity invested in each project 
these loans are underwritten and managed by a specialized real estate lending group that actively monitors the construction phase and manages the loan disbursements according to the predetermined construction schedule 
total consumer loans were billion at december   and represented of our total loan and lease credit exposure 
the consumer portfolio was diversified primarily among automobile  home equity loans and lines of credit  and residential mortgages see consumer credit discussion 
automobile automobile loans are primarily comprised of loans made through automotive dealerships and include exposure in selected states outside of our primary banking markets 
no state outside of our primary banking market represented more than of our total automobile portfolio at december  we have successfully implemented a loan securitization strategy to remain within our established portfolio concentration limits 
home equity home equity lending includes both home equity loans and lines of credit 
this type of lending  which is secured by a first lien or junior lien on the borrower s residence  allows customers to borrow against the equity in their home 
products include closed end loans which are generally fixed rate with principal and interest payments  and variable rate  interest only lines of credit which do not require payment of principal during the year revolving period of the line of credit 
applications are underwritten centrally in conjunction with an automated underwriting system 
the home equity consists of both first lien and junior lien loans and lines of credit with underwriting criteria based on minimum credit scores  debt to income ratios  and ltv ratios 
residential mortgages residential mortgages represent loans to consumers for the purchase or refinance of a residence 
these loans are generally financed over a year to year term  and in most cases  are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence 
all applications are underwritten centrally and do not originate residential mortgages that allow negative amortization or allow the borrower multiple payment options 
also  all residential mortgages are originated based on a completed full appraisal 
other consumer loans leases primarily consists of consumer loans not secured by real estate  including personal unsecured loans

as shown in the table above  our loan portfolio is diversified by consumer and commercial credit 
we designate specific loan types  collateral types  and loan structures as part of our credit concentration policy 
c i lending by segment  specific limits for cre primary project types  loans secured by residential real estate  shared national credit exposure  and unsecured lending represent examples of specifically tracked components of our concentration management process 
our concentration management process is approved by our board of directors and is one of the strategies utilized to ensure a high quality  well diversified portfolio that is consistent with our overall objective of maintaining an aggregate moderate to low risk profile

table of contents commercial credit the primary factors considered in commercial credit approvals are the financial strength of the borrower  assessment of the borrower s management capabilities  cash flows from operations  industry sector trends  type and sufficiency of collateral  type of exposure  transaction structure  and the general economic outlook 
while these are the primary factors considered  there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process 
we utilize a centralized preview and senior loan approval committee  led by our chief credit officer 
the risk rating see next paragraph and complexity of the credit determines the threshold for approval of the senior loan committee with a minimum credit exposure of million 
for loans not requiring senior loan committee approval  with the exception of small business loans  credit officers who understand each local region and are experienced in the industries and loan structures of the requested credit exposure are involved in all loan decisions and have the primary credit authority 
for small business loans  we utilize a centralized loan approval process for standard products and structures 
in this centralized decision environment  certain individuals who understand each local region may make credit extension decisions to preserve our commitment to the communities we operate in 
in addition to disciplined and consistent judgmental factors  a sophisticated credit scoring process is used as a primary evaluation tool in the determination of approving a loan within the centralized loan approval process 
in commercial lending  on going credit management is dependent on the type and nature of the loan 
we monitor all significant exposures on an on going basis 
all commercial credit extensions are assigned internal risk ratings reflecting the borrower s pd and lgd 
this two dimensional rating methodology provides granularity in the portfolio management process 
the pd is rated and applied at the borrower level 
the lgd is rated and applied based on the specific type of credit extension and the quality and lien position associated with the underlying collateral 
the internal risk ratings are assessed at origination and updated at each periodic monitoring event 
there is also extensive macro portfolio management analysis on an on going basis 
we continually review and adjust our risk rating criteria based on actual experience  which provides us with the current risk level in the portfolio and is the basis for determining an appropriate acl amount for the commercial portfolio 
a centralized portfolio management team monitors and reports on the performance of the entire commercial portfolio  including small business loans  to provide consistent oversight 
in addition to the initial credit analysis conducted during the approval process  our credit review group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality and or risk of new loan originations 
this group is part of our risk management area  and conducts portfolio reviews on a risk based cycle to evaluate individual loans  validate risk ratings  as well as test the consistency of credit processes 
our standardized loan grading system considers many components that directly correlate to loan quality and likelihood of repayment  one of which is guarantor support 
on an annual basis  or more frequently if warranted  we consider  among other things  the guarantor s reputation and creditworthiness  along with various key financial metrics such as liquidity and net worth  assuming such information is available 
our assessment of the guarantor s credit strength  or lack thereof  is reflected in our risk ratings for such loans  which is directly tied to  and an integral component of  our alll methodology 
when a loan goes to impaired status  viable guarantor support is considered in the determination of the recognition of a loan loss 
if our assessment of the guarantor s credit strength yields an inherent capacity to perform  we will seek repayment from the guarantor as part of the collection process and have done so successfully 
however  we do not formally track the repayment success from guarantors 
substantially all loans categorized as classified see note of notes to consolidated financial statements are managed by our sad 
the sad is a specialized group of credit professionals that handle the day to day management of workouts  commercial recoveries  and problem loan sales 
its responsibilities include developing and implementing action plans  assessing risk ratings  and determining the appropriateness of the allowance  the accrual status  and the ultimate collectability of the classified loan portfolio 
c i portfolio the c i portfolio is comprised of loans to businesses where the source of repayment is associated with the on going operations of the business 
generally  the loans are secured with the financing of the borrower s assets  such as equipment  accounts receivable  and or inventory 
in many cases  the loans are secured by real estate  although the operation  sale  or refinancing of the real estate is not a primary source of repayment for the loan 
for loans secured by real estate  appropriate appraisals are obtained at origination and updated on an as needed basis in compliance with regulatory requirements 
there were no commercial loan segments considered an industry or geographic concentration of lending 
currently  higher risk segments of the c i portfolio include loans to borrowers supporting the home building industry  contractors  and leveraged lending 
we manage the risks inherent in this portfolio through origination policies  a defined loan concentration policy with established limits  on going loan level reviews and portfolio level reviews  recourse requirements  and continuous portfolio risk management activities 
our origination policies for this portfolio include loan product type specific policies such as ltv and debt service coverage ratios  as applicable 
while some c i borrowers have been challenged by the continued weakness in the economy  problem loans have trended downward  reflecting a combination of proactive risk identification and effective workout strategies implemented by our sad 
nevertheless  some borrowers may no longer have sufficient capital to withstand the extended stress and comply with the original terms of their credit agreements 
we continue to focus attention on the portfolio management process to proactively identify borrowers that may be facing financial difficulty to assess all potential solutions 

table of contents cre portfolio we manage the risks inherent in this portfolio specific to cre lending  focusing on the quality of the developer  and the specifics associated with each project 
generally  we limit our loans to of the appraised value of the commercial real estate at origination  require net operating cash flows to be of required interest and principal payments  and if the commercial real estate is nonowner occupied  require that at least of the space of the project be preleased 
we actively monitor both geographic and project type concentrations and performance metrics of all cre loan types  with a focus on higher risk classes 
both macro level and loan level stress test scenarios based on existing and forecast market conditions are part of the on going portfolio management process for the cre portfolio 
dedicated real estate professionals originated the majority of the portfolio  with the remainder obtained from prior bank acquisitions 
appraisals are obtained from approved vendors  and are reviewed by an internal appraisal review group comprised of certified appraisers to ensure the quality of the valuation used in the underwriting process 
the portfolio is diversified by project type and loan size  and this diversification represents a significant portion of the credit risk management strategies employed for this portfolio 
subsequent to the origination of the loan  the credit review group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality of the underwriting and or risk of new loan originations 
appraisal values are obtained in conjunction with all originations and renewals  and on an as needed basis  in compliance with regulatory requirements 
we continue to perform on going portfolio level reviews within the cre portfolio 
these reviews generate action plans based on occupancy levels or sales volume associated with the projects being reviewed 
property values are updated using appraisals on a regular basis to ensure appropriate decisions regarding the on going management of the portfolio reflect the changing market conditions 
this highly individualized process requires working closely with all of our borrowers  as well as an in depth knowledge of cre project lending and the market environment 
in  we segregated our cre portfolio into core and noncore segments 
we believe segregating noncore cre from core cre improved our ability to understand the nature  performance prospects  and problem resolution opportunities of these segments  thus allowing us to continue to deal proactively with any emerging credit issues 
we have not subsequently originated any noncore cre loans 
a cre loan is generally considered core when the borrower is an experienced  well capitalized developer in our midwest footprint  and had either an established meaningful relationship with us that generated an acceptable return on capital or demonstrated the prospect of becoming one 
the core cre portfolio was billion at december   representing of total cre loans 
the performance of the core portfolio has met our expectations based on the consistency of the asset quality metrics within the portfolio 
based on our extensive project level assessment process  including forward looking collateral valuations  we continue to believe the credit quality of the core portfolio is stable 
loans are not reclassified between the core and noncore segments based on performance 
credit quality data regarding the acl and nals  segregated by core cre loans and noncore cre loans  is presented in the following table table commercial real estate core vs 
noncore portfolios dollar amounts in millions december  ending nonaccrual balance prior ncos acl acl credit mark loans total core noncore sad noncore other total noncore total commercial real estate december  ending nonaccrual balance prior ncos acl acl credit mark loans total core noncore sad noncore other total noncore total commercial real estate calculated as prior ncos acl ending balance prior ncos noncore loans are managed by sad  the area responsible for managing loans and relationships designated as classified loans 

table of contents as shown in the above table  the ending balance of the cre portfolio at december   declined billion  or  compared with december  the majority of this decline occurred in the noncore segment  and was a result of payoffs and ncos as we actively focus on the noncore portfolio to reduce our overall cre exposure 
this reduction demonstrates our continued commitment to achieving a materially lower risk profile in the cre portfolio  consistent with our overall objective of maintaining an aggregate moderate to low risk profile 
we will continue to support our core developer customers as appropriate  however  we do not believe that significant additional cre activity is appropriate given the current market conditions 
also as shown above  substantial reserves for the noncore portfolio have been established 
at december   the acl related to the noncore portfolio was 
the combination of the existing acl and prior ncos represents the total credit actions taken on each segment of the portfolio 
from this data  we calculate a credit mark that provides a consistent measurement of the cumulative credit actions taken against a specific portfolio segment 
the credit mark associated with the sad managed noncore portfolio is an indicator of the proactive portfolio management strategy employed for this portfolio 
consumer credit consumer credit approvals are based on  among other factors  the financial strength and payment history of the borrower  type of exposure  and the transaction structure 
consumer credit decisions are generally made in a centralized environment utilizing decision models 
importantly  certain individuals who understand each local region have the authority to make credit extension decisions to preserve our focus on the local communities we operate in 
each credit extension is assigned a specific pd and lgd 
the pd is generally based on the borrower s most recent credit bureau score fico  which we update quarterly  while the lgd is related to the type of collateral and the ltv ratio associated with the credit extension 
in consumer lending  credit risk is managed from a segment ie  loan type  collateral position  geography  etc 
and vintage performance analysis 
all portfolio segments are continuously monitored for changes in delinquency trends and other asset quality indicators 
we make extensive use of portfolio assessment models to continuously monitor the quality of the portfolio  which may result in changes to future origination strategies 
the on going analysis and review process results in a determination of an appropriate alll amount for our consumer loan portfolio 
the independent risk management group has a consumer process review component to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the consumer credit processes 
collection action is initiated as needed through a centrally managed collection and recovery function 
the collection group employs a series of collection methodologies designed to maintain a high level of effectiveness while maximizing efficiency 
in addition to the consumer loan portfolio  the collection group is responsible for collection activity on all sold and securitized consumer loans and leases 
collection practices include a single contact point for the majority of the residential real estate secured portfolios 
effective with the third quarter  we identified certain loans within the consumer portfolio that met the definition of collateral dependent as defined by regulatory guidance as the borrowers had not reaffirmed their debt discharged in a chapter bankruptcy filing 
the bankruptcy court s discharge of the borrower s debt is considered a concession when the discharged debt is not reaffirmed  and as such  the loans were classified as tdrs  placed on nonaccrual status  and written down to collateral value  less anticipated selling costs 
previously  we recorded the charge off when the loan reached days past due and did not classify these loans as tdrs 
many of these loans were current  with many borrowers having paid according to the contractual terms for several years 
in  this change increased ncos by million  nals by million  and tdrs by million across the automobile  residential mortgage  and home equity portfolios 
automobile portfolio our strategy in the automobile loan and lease portfolio continued to focus on high quality borrowers as measured by both fico and internal custom scores  combined with appropriate ltv s  terms  and profitability 
our strategy and operational capabilities allow us to appropriately manage the origination quality across the entire portfolio  including our newer markets 
although increased origination volume and the entering new markets can be associated with increased risk levels  we believe our strategy and operational capabilities significantly mitigate these risks 
we have continued to consistently execute our value proposition and take advantage of available market opportunities 
importantly  we have maintained our high credit quality standard while growing the portfolio 
we have developed and implemented a loan securitization strategy to ensure we remain within our established portfolio concentration limits 

table of contents during  a total of billion of automobile loans were transferred to trusts in two separate securitization transactions 
additional information regarding these securitization transactions is located in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
residential real estate secured portfolios the properties securing our residential mortgage and home equity portfolios are primarily located within our geographic footprint 
the continued stress on home prices has caused the performance in these portfolios to remain weaker than historical levels 
the residential secured portfolio originations continue to be of high quality  with the majority of the negative credit impact coming from loans originated in and earlier 
we continue to evaluate all of our policies and processes associated with managing these portfolios 
our loss mitigation and foreclosure activities are consolidated in one location under common management 
this structure allows us to focus on effectively helping our customers with appropriate solutions for their specific circumstances

ltv ratios reflect collateral values at the time of loan origination 
portfolio weighted average fico scores reflect currently updated customer credit scores whereas origination weighted average fico scores reflect the customer credit scores at the time of loan origination 
represents only owned portfolio originations 
home equity portfolio our home equity portfolio loans and lines of credit consists of both first lien and junior lien mortgage loans with underwriting criteria based on minimum credit scores  debt to income ratios  and ltv ratios 
we offer closed end home equity loans which are generally fixed rate with principal and interest payments  and variable rate interest only home equity lines of credit which do not require payment of principal during the year revolving period of the line of credit 
applications are underwritten centrally in conjunction with an automated underwriting system 
given the low interest rate environment over the past several years  many borrowers have utilized the line of credit home equity product as the primary source of financing their home versus residential mortgages 
during  of our home equity portfolio originations were secured by a first lien mortgage 
as a result  the proportion of the home equity portfolio secured by a first lien has increased significantly over the past three years  positively impacting the portfolio s risk profile 
at december   of our total home equity portfolio was secured by first lien mortgages 
the first lien position  combined with continued high average fico scores  significantly reduces the pd associated with these loans 
we focus on high quality borrowers primarily located within our footprint 
further  we actively manage the extension of credit and the amount of credit extended through a combination of criteria including financial position  debt to income policies  and ltv policy limits 
the combination of high quality borrowers as measured by financial condition and fico score  as well as the concentration of first lien position loans  provides a high degree of confidence regarding the performance of the originations 
because we focus on developing complete relationships with our customers  many of our home equity borrowers utilize other products and services 
also  the majority of our home equity line of credit borrowers consistently pay more than the minimum payment required in any given month 

table of contents we believe we have underwritten credit conservatively within this portfolio 
we have not originated home equity loans or lines of credit with an ltv at origination greater than  except for infrequent situations with high quality borrowers 
however  declines in housing prices have decreased the value of the collateral for this portfolio and have caused a portion of the portfolio to have an ltv greater than 
these higher ltv ratios are directly correlated with borrower payment patterns and are a focus of our loss mitigation and home saver groups 
effective in the third quarter  we no longer originate junior lien loans with an ltv greater than 
real estate market values at the time of origination directly affect the amount of credit extended and  in the event of default  subsequent changes in these values impact the severity of losses 
we obtain a property valuation for every loan or line of credit as part of the origination process  and the valuation is reviewed by a real estate professional in conjunction with the credit underwriting process 
the type of property valuation obtained is based on credit parameters  and a majority of these valuations are based on complete walkthrough appraisals 
we believe an avm estimate with a signed property inspection is an appropriate valuation source for a portion of our home equity lending activities 
this valuation policy  along with our other credit policies  are re evaluated on an on going basis with the intent of ensuring complete independence in the requesting and reviewing of real estate valuations associated with loan decisions 
we update values as appropriate  and in compliance with applicable regulations  particularly for loans identified as higher risk 
loans are identified as higher risk based on performance indicators and the updated values are utilized to facilitate our portfolio management processes  as well as our workout and loss mitigation functions 
we continue to make origination policy adjustments based on our assessment of an appropriate risk profile and industry actions  as well as the recently issued basel iii nprs see capital section 
in addition to origination policy adjustments  we take actions  as necessary  to manage the risk profile of this portfolio 
we believe our credit risk management systems allow for effective portfolio analysis and segmentation to identify the highest risk exposures in the portfolio 
our disclosures regarding lien position and fico distribution are examples of segmentation analysis 
we continue to identify situations where borrowers make a purposeful financial decision to stop making required payments on the junior lien loan  and in some cases  the first lien loan 
this strategic default scenario is generally associated with borrowers that have very limited or no history of delinquency 
these accounts also tend to migrate quickly from a current status to charge off without exhibiting the historical behaviors at each delinquency stage 
the resulting increase in the relative speed of the migration from current status to charge off represents a negative impact to the longer term performance of the portfolio 
although the collateral value assessment is an important component of the overall credit risk analysis  there are very few instances of available equity in junior lien default situations 
further  effective in  any junior lien loan associated with a nonaccruing first lien loan is also placed on nonaccrual status 
within the home equity line of credit portfolio  the standard product is a year interest only draw period with a year fully amortizing term at the end of the draw period 
prior to  the standard product was a year draw period with a balloon payment  while subsequent originations convert to a year amortizing loan structure 
after the year revolving period  the borrower must reapply to extend the existing structure or begin repaying the debt in a traditional term structure 
the principal and interest payment associated with the term structure will be higher than the interest only payment  resulting in maturity risk 
this maturity risk is embedded in the portfolio which we address with proactive contact strategies beginning one year prior to maturity 
in certain circumstances  our home saver group is able to provide payment and structure relief to borrowers experiencing significant financial hardship associated with the payment adjustment 
the table below summarizes our home equity line of credit portfolio by maturity date table maturity schedule of home equity line of credit portfolio december  dollar amounts in millions year or less to years to years to years more than years total secured by first lien secured by junior lien total home equity line of credit 
table of contents historically  less than of our home equity lines of credit that are one year or less from maturity actually reach the maturity date  and we anticipate this percentage will decline in future periods as our proactive approach to managing maturity risk continues to evolve 
residential mortgages portfolio we focus on higher quality borrowers and underwrite all applications centrally 
we do not originate residential mortgages that allow negative amortization or allow the borrower multiple payment options 
we will continue to evaluate the impact of the recently issued basel iii nprs on our residential mortgage origination policies 
all residential mortgages are originated based on a completed full appraisal during the credit underwriting process 
we update values on a regular basis in compliance with applicable regulations to facilitate our portfolio management  as well as our workout and loss mitigation functions 
generally  our practice is to sell a significant portion of our fixed rate originations in the secondary market 
as such  at december   of our total residential mortgage portfolio were arms 
these arms primarily consist of a fixed rate of interest for the first to years  and then adjust annually 
at december   arm loans that were expected to have rates reset through totaled billion 
these loans scheduled to reset are primarily associated with loans originated subsequent to  and as such  are not subject to the most significant declines in underlying property value 
given the quality of our borrowers  the relatively low current interest rates  and the results of our continued analysis including possible impacts of changes in interest rates  we believe that we have a relatively limited exposure to arm reset risk 
nonetheless  we have taken actions to mitigate our risk exposure 
we initiate borrower contact at least six months prior to the interest rate resetting  and have been successful in converting many arms to fixed rate loans through this process 
given the relatively low current interest rates  many fixed rate products currently offer a better interest rate to our arm borrowers 
several government programs continued to impact the residential mortgage portfolio  including various refinance programs such as hamp and harp  which positively affected the availability of credit for the industry 
during the year ended december   we closed million in harp residential mortgages and million in hamp residential mortgages 
the harp residential mortgage loans are considered current and are either part of our residential mortgage portfolio or serviced for others 
the hamp refinancings are associated with residential mortgages that are serviced for others 
we are subject to repurchase risk associated with residential mortgage loans sold in the secondary market 
an appropriate level of reserve for representations and warranties related to residential mortgage loans sold has been established to address this repurchase risk inherent in the portfolio see operational risk discussion 
credit quality this section should be read in conjunction with note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe the most meaningful way to assess overall credit quality performance is through an analysis of credit quality performance ratios 
this approach forms the basis of most of the discussion in the sections immediately following npas and nals  tdrs  acl  and ncos 
in addition  we utilize delinquency rates  risk distribution and migration patterns  and product segmentation in the analysis of our credit quality performance 
credit quality performance in reflected overall continued improvement 
nals declined to million at december   compared to december   despite the impact of million of nal additions as a result of chapter bankruptcy loans 
ncos declined compared to the prior year despite the impact of ncos related to chapter bankruptcy loans 
commercial criticized and classified loans declined significantly reflecting the continued improvement in the commercial portfolio 
the acl to total loans ratio declined to and our acl coverage ratios improved as a result of asset quality improvement 
npas  nals  and tdrs this section should be read in conjunction with note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
npas and nals npas consist of nals  which represent loans and leases no longer accruing interest  impaired loans held for sale  oreo properties  and other npas 
any loan in our portfolio may be placed on nonaccrual status prior to the policies described below when collection of principal or interest is in doubt 
also  when a borrower with discharged non reaffirmed debt in a chapter bankruptcy is identified and the loan is determined to be collateral dependent  the consumer loan is placed on nonaccrual status 

table of contents c i and cre loans are placed on nonaccrual status at days past due 
with the exception of residential mortgage loans guaranteed by government organizations which continue to accrue interest  residential mortgage loans are placed on nonaccrual status at days past due 
first lien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status at days past due 
junior lien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status at the earlier of days past due or when the related first lien loan has been identified as nonaccrual 
automobile and other consumer loans are generally charged off when the loan is days past due 
when interest accruals are suspended  accrued interest income is reversed with current year accruals charged to earnings and prior year amounts generally charged off as a credit loss 
when  in our judgment  the borrower s ability to make required interest and principal payments has resumed and collectability is no longer in doubt  the loan or lease is returned to accrual status

tdr loans this section should be read in conjunction with note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
tdrs are modified loans in which a concession is provided to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties 
tdrs can be classified as either accrual or nonaccrual loans 
nonaccrual tdrs are included in nals whereas accruing tdrs are excluded from nals  as it is probable that all contractual principal and interest due under the restructured terms will be collected 
tdrs primarily reflect our loss mitigation efforts to proactively work with borrowers having difficulty making their payments

table of contents our strategy is to structure the commercial tdrs in a manner that avoids new concessions subsequent to the initial tdr terms 
however  there are times when subsequent modifications are required  such as when the modified loan matures 
often the loans are performing in accordance with the tdr terms  and a new note is originated with similar modified terms 
these loans are subjected to the normal underwriting standards and processes for other similar credit extensions  both new and existing 
if the loan is not performing in accordance with the existing tdr terms  typically a more aggressive strategy is put in place 
in accordance with asc  the refinanced note is evaluated to determine if it is considered a new loan or a continuation of the prior loan 
a new loan is considered for removal of the tdr designation 
a continuation of the prior note requires the continuation of the tdr designation  and because the refinanced note constitutes a new legal agreement  they are included in our tdr activity table below as both a new tdr and a restructured tdr removal during the period 
the types of concessions granted are consistent with those granted on new tdrs and include interest rate reductions  amortization or maturity date changes beyond what the collateral supports  and principal forgiveness based on the borrower s specific needs at a point in time 
our policy does not limit the number of times a loan may be modified 
a loan may be modified multiple times if it is considered to be in the best interest of both the borrower and us 
loans are not automatically considered to be accruing tdrs upon the granting of a new concession 
accrual status is determined based on delinquency status and whether collection of principal and interest is in doubt 
if the loan is not days past due and no loss is expected based on the modified terms  the modified tdr remains in accruing status 
for loans that are on nonaccrual status before the modification  collection of both principal and interest must not be in doubt  and the borrower must be able to exhibit sufficient cash flows for a six month period of time to service the debt in order to return to accruing status 
this six month period could extend before or after the restructure date

table of contents we maintain two reserves  both of which in our judgment are appropriate to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio the alll and the aulc 
combined  these reserves comprise the total acl 
our credit administration group is responsible for developing the methodology assumptions and estimates used in the calculation  as well as determining the appropriateness of the acl 
the alll represents the estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the reported date 
additions to the alll result from recording provision expense for loan losses or increased risk levels resulting from loan risk rating downgrades  while reductions reflect charge offs net of recoveries  decreased risk levels resulting from loan risk rating upgrades  or the sale of loans 
the aulc is determined by applying the transaction reserve process to the unfunded portion of the loan exposures adjusted by an applicable funding expectation 
a provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the acl to the level we have determined to be appropriate to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio 
the provision for credit losses in was million  compared with million in we regularly evaluate the appropriateness of the acl by performing on going evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio  including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category  the financial condition of specific borrowers  the level of delinquent loans  the value of any collateral and  where applicable  the existence of any guarantees or other documented support 
we evaluate the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our acl at each reporting date 
in addition to general economic conditions and the other factors described above  we also consider the impact of collateral value trends and portfolio diversification 
our acl evaluation process includes the on going assessment of credit quality metrics  and a comparison of certain acl benchmarks to current performance 
while the total acl balance has declined in recent quarters  all of the relevant benchmarks remain strong 
we have incorporated recent regulatory guidance which focused on home equity loans  specifically junior lien loans when the related first lien loan is delinquent  into our acl adequacy analysis processes 
as we evaluated this guidance in the context of the continued economic strain on some of our borrowers  we determined it was appropriate to assess borrower risk at a more granular level in order to ensure we had identified the incurred risk embedded within our portfolios secured by residential real estate  particularly the home equity junior lien portfolio 
in addition to the updated fico score for each borrower and the delinquency status of each huntington loan  our analysis also considers any non delinquent huntington loan secured by residential real estate when the borrower has a significant delinquency on the most recent credit bureau report 
additionally  beginning in  a reserve amount associated with estimated incurred losses due to maturity risk in the home equity line of credit portfolio is included in the home equity alll

the reduction in the alll compared with december   reflected a decline in all portfolios 
the declines in the c i and cre alll reflected significant improvements in the level of criticized and classified loans combined with lower cre loan balances 
the home equity alll declined as a result of a combination of the improving underlying asset quality and our view of expected future performance 
the residential mortgage alll declined as a result of the improving underlying asset quality  while the automobile alll decreased slightly as the underlying asset quality remained relatively consistent 
compared with december   the aulc decreased million primarily reflecting a significant improvement in the underlying risk profile of the borrowers with unfunded loan commitments 
the acl to total loans declined to at december   compared to at december  we believe the decline in the ratio is appropriate given the continued improvement in the risk profile of our loan portfolio 
further  we believe that early identification of loans with changes in credit metrics and aggressive action plans for these loans  combined with originating high quality new loans will contribute to continued improvement in our key credit quality metrics 
we continue to see positive economic trends within our midwest markets relative to the broader united states 
nevertheless  broad based customer sentiment began to change late in the fourth quarter  as customers have increased concerns regarding the us economy 
some businesses are hesitant to invest given the current uncertainty in the economy 
unemployment rates remain high  however  our footprint large metropolitan statistical areas msa unemployment rates were below the national average as of november we have significant exposure to loans secured by residential real estate and continue to be an active lender in our communities 
the impact of the downturn in real estate values over the past several years has had a significant impact on some of our borrowers as evidenced by the higher delinquencies and ncos since late recently  real estate values have begun to slowly rise from their levels 
fhfa housing prices increased in the third quarter relative to the year ago quarter in all of our footprint states  except pennsylvania  which was essentially unchanged 
strong affordability and continued economic growth should support continued housing recovery in  as long as risks to the overall us economy are contained 
given the combination of these noted positive and negative factors  we believe that our acl is appropriate and its coverage level is reflective of the quality of our portfolio and the current operating environment 
ncos this section should be read in conjunction with significant item 
table of contents any loan in any portfolio may be charged off prior to the policies described below if a loss confirming event has occurred 
loss confirming events include  but are not limited to  bankruptcy unsecured  continued delinquency  foreclosure  or receipt of an asset valuation indicating a collateral deficiency and that asset is the sole source of repayment 
additionally  discharged  collateral dependent non reaffirmed debt in chapter bankruptcy filings will result in a charge off to estimated collateral value  less anticipated selling costs 
c i and cre loans are either charged off or written down to net realizable value at days past due 
automobile loans and other consumer loans are charged off at days past due 
first lien and junior lien home equity loans are charged off to the estimated fair value of the collateral  less anticipated selling costs  at days past due and days past due  respectively 
residential mortgages are charged off to the estimated fair value of the collateral  less anticipated selling costs  at days past due 

table of contents the following table reflects nco detail for each of the last five years table net loan and lease charge offs year ended december  dollar amounts in thousands net charge offs by loan and lease type commercial commercial and industrial commercial real estate construction commercial total commercial real estate total commercial consumer automobile home equity residential mortgage other consumer total consumer total net charge offs net charge offs ratio commercial commercial and industrial commercial real estate construction commercial commercial real estate total commercial consumer automobile home equity residential mortgage other consumer total consumer net charge offs as a of average loans in assessing nco trends  it is helpful to understand the process of how commercial loans are treated as they deteriorate over time 
the alll established is consistent with the level of risk associated with the original underwriting 
as a part of our normal portfolio management process for commercial loans  the loan is periodically reviewed and the alll is increased or decreased based on the revised risk rating 
in certain cases  the standard alll is determined to not be appropriate  and a specific reserve is established based on the projected cash flow or collateral value of the specific loan 
charge offs  if necessary  are generally recognized in a period after the specific alll was established 
if the previously established alll exceeds that necessary to satisfactorily resolve the problem loan  a reduction in the overall level of the alll could be recognized 
consumer loans are treated in much the same manner as commercial loans  with increasing reserve factors applied based on the risk characteristics of the loan  although specific reserves are not identified for consumer loans 
in summary  if loan quality deteriorates  the typical credit sequence would be periods of reserve building  followed by periods of higher ncos as the previously established alll is utilized 
additionally  an increase in the alll either precedes or is in conjunction with increases in nals 
when a loan is classified as nal  it is evaluated for specific alll or charge off 
as a result  an increase in nals does not necessarily result in an increase in the alll or an expectation of higher future ncos 
we anticipate a continuation of the pattern established over the last year of residential mortgage portfolio nco annualized percentages being lower than the home equity portfolio nco annualized percentages 
as we have focused on originating high quality home equity loans  we believe the pd risk is lower in the home equity portfolio 
however  the lgd component is significantly higher than the residential mortgage portfolio  which results in our projection for lower ncos in the residential mortgage portfolio relative to the home equity portfolio in the future 
therefore  we believe the residential mortgage nco annualized percentage will remain lower compared to the home equity portfolio as a result of the entire first lien composition of the residential mortgage portfolio  as well as the result of previous credit actions improving the underlying quality of these portfolios 
both the home equity and residential mortgage portfolio nco levels are anticipated to remain at elevated levels in the near future 
the home equity portfolio will continue to be impacted by borrowers that are seeking to refinance  but are in a negative equity position because of the junior lien loan 
right sizing and debt forgiveness associated with these situations are becoming more frequent as borrowers realize the impact to their credit is minor  and that a default on a junior lien loan is not likely to cause borrowers to lose their home 

table of contents all residential mortgage loans greater than days past due are charged down to the estimated value of the collateral  less anticipated selling costs 
the remaining balance is in delinquent status until a modification can be completed  or the loan goes through the foreclosure process 
for the home equity portfolio  virtually all of the defaults represent full charge offs as there is no remaining equity  creating a lower delinquency rate but a higher nco impact 
versus c i ncos decreased million  or  primarily reflecting credit quality improvement in the underlying portfolio as well as our on going proactive credit management practices 
there was not any concentration in either geography or project type 
cre ncos decreased million  or  primarily reflecting credit quality improvement in the underlying portfolio as well as our on going proactive credit management practices 
there was no concentration in either geography or project type 
the performance of the portfolio was consistent with our expectations 
automobile ncos decreased million  or  despite the million impact of chapter bankruptcy ncos in the relatively low levels of ncos reflected the continued high credit quality of originations and a strong resale market for used vehicles 
home equity ncos increased million  or  and included million of chapter bankruptcy ncos 
excluding the impact of the chapter bankruptcy loans  the decline in the remaining portion of the portfolio is consistent with our expectations 
we continue to manage the default rate through focused delinquency monitoring as essentially all defaults for junior lien home equity loans incur significant losses reflecting the reduction of equity associated with the collateral property 
residential mortgage ncos declined million  or  despite million of chapter bankruptcy ncos 
the decline reflects improvement in the overall economy compared to the year ago period 
market risk market risk represents the risk of loss due to changes in market values of assets and liabilities 
we incur market risk in the normal course of business through exposures to market interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices  and credit spreads 
we have identified two primary sources of market risk interest rate risk and price risk 
interest rate risk overview huntington actively manages interest rate risk  as changes in market interest rates can have a significant impact on reported earnings 
the interest rate risk process is designed to compare income simulations in market scenarios designed to alter the direction  magnitude  and speed of interest rate changes  as well as the slope of the yield curve 
these scenarios are designed to illustrate the embedded optionality in the balance sheet from  among other things  faster or slower mortgage prepayments and changes in deposit mix 
income simulation and economic value analysis interest rate risk measurement is calculated and reported to the alco and roc monthly 
the information reported includes the identification of any policy limits exceeded  along with an assessment that describes the policy limit breach and outlines the action plan and timeline for resolution  mitigation  or assumption of the risk 
huntington uses two approaches to model interest rate risk interest sensitive earnings at risk ise analysis and economic value of equity eve analysis 
under ise analysis  net interest income is modeled utilizing various assumptions for assets  liabilities  and derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios 
ise analysis measures the sensitivity of interest sensitive earnings over a one year time horizon 
market implied forward rates and various likely and extreme interest rate scenarios are used for ise analysis 
these likely and extreme scenarios include rapid and gradual interest rate ramps  rate shocks and yield curve twists 
the ise analysis used in the following table reflects the analysis used monthly by management 
it models gradual  and basis point parallel shifts in market interest rates over the next one year period  beyond the interest rate change implied by the forward yield curve 
due to the current low level of interest rates  the analysis reflects a declining interest rate scenario of basis points  the point at which many assets and liabilities reach zero percent 

table of contents huntington is within board policy limits for the and basis point scenarios 
there is no policy limit for the basis point scenario 
the table below shows the results of the scenario as of december  table net sensitive earnings at risk net interest income at risk basis point change scenario board policy limits december  the ise at risk reported at december   shows that huntington is asset sensitive  meaning that earnings increase decrease when rates rise fall 
the primary reason for these results is that more assets primarily libor indexed loans to customers than liabilities primarily non maturity deposits will reprice over the modeled one year period 
the following table shows the income sensitivity of selected assets and liabilities to changes in market interest rates 
the table compares the ise analysis for selected huntington portfolios to a portfolio that assumes sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
we calculate the percent change in interest income expense as the change in the base huntington portfolio divided by the change in the sensitive portfolio 
the results for the and basis point ramps also confirm the asset sensitive nature of the portfolio 
in both the and basis point ramps  interest income for total loans and  respectively increases faster than interest expense for interest bearing deposits and  respectively 
additionally  total borrowings show changes in interest expense of and for and basis point scenarios  respectively 
while these results are high  since total borrowings represent a small percentage of total interest sensitive liabilities  the financial impact of their sensitivity to rising rates is minimal 
the basis point parallel ramp confirms the asset sensitive position as the interest income for total loans  decreases faster than the interest expense of deposits 
table interest income expense sensitivity percent of percent change in interest income expense total earning for a given change in interest rates assets over under base case parallel ramp basis point change scenario total loans total investments and other earning assets total interest sensitive income total interest bearing deposits total borrowings total interest sensitive expense at december  under eve analysis  the economic value of financial assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments  is derived through the discounting of cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period 
the economic value of equity is calculated as the difference between the estimated market value of assets and liabilities  net of the impact of off balance sheet instruments 
the eve analysis used in the following table reflects the analysis used monthly by management 
it models immediate  and basis point parallel shifts in market interest rates 
due to the current low level of interest rates  the analysis reflects a declining interest rate scenario of basis points  the point at which many assets and liabilities reach zero percent 
huntington is within board policy limits for the and basis point scenarios 
there is no policy limit for the basis point scenario 
the table below shows the results of the scenario as of december  
table of contents table economic value of equity at risk economic value of equity at risk basis point change scenario board policy limits december  the eve at risk reported at december   shows that as interest rates increase decrease immediately  the economic value of equity position will decrease increase  since the amount and duration of the assets are longer than the amount and duration of liabilities 
when interest rates rise  fixed rate assets generally lose economic value  the longer the duration  the greater the value lost 
the opposite is true when interest rates fall 
the following table details the economic value sensitivity to changes in market interest rates at december  for loans  investments  deposits  and borrowings 
the change in economic value for each portfolio is measured as the percent change from the base economic value for that portfolio 
the analysis reflects that  in a sharply higher rate scenario  total tangible assets are more sensitive than total tangible liabilities 
investments and other earning assets contribute to this sensitivity  largely due to fixed rate securities investments

msr this section should be read in conjunction with note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   we had million of capitalized msrs representing the right to service billion in mortgage loans 
of this million  million was recorded using the fair value method  and million was recorded using the amortization method 
msr fair values are very sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans  which can be greatly reduced by prepayments 
prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise 
we have employed strategies to reduce the risk of msr fair value changes or impairment 
in addition  we engage a third party to provide valuation tools and assistance with our strategies with the objective to decrease the volatility from msr fair value changes 
however  volatile changes in interest rates can diminish the effectiveness of these hedges 
we typically report msr fair value adjustments net of hedge related trading activity in the mortgage banking income category of noninterest income 
changes in fair value between reporting dates are recorded as an increase or a decrease in mortgage banking income 
msrs recorded using the amortization method generally relate to loans originated with historically low interest rates  resulting in a lower probability of prepayments and  ultimately  impairment 
msr assets are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents price risk price risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse movements in the prices of financial instruments that are carried at fair value and subject to fair value accounting 
we have price risk from trading securities  securities owned by our broker dealer subsidiaries  foreign exchange positions  equity investments  investments in mortgage backed securities  and marketable equity securities held by our insurance subsidiaries 
we have established loss limits on the trading portfolio  the amount of foreign exchange exposure that can be maintained  and the amount of marketable equity securities that can be held by the insurance subsidiaries 
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk of loss due to the possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current or future commitments resulting from external macro market issues  investor and customer perception of financial strength  and events unrelated to us  such as war  terrorism  or financial institution market specific issues 
in addition  the mix and maturity structure of huntington s balance sheet  amount of cash on hand and unencumbered securities  and the availability of contingent sources of funding  can have an impact on huntington s ability to satisfy current or future funding commitments 
we manage liquidity risk at both the bank and the parent company 
the overall objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that we can obtain cost effective funding to meet current and future obligations  and can maintain sufficient levels of on hand liquidity  under both normal business as usual and unanticipated stressed circumstances 
the alco was appointed by our roc to oversee liquidity risk management and the establishment of liquidity risk policies and limits 
contingency funding plans are in place  which measure forecasted sources and uses of funds under various scenarios in order to prepare for unexpected liquidity shortages 
liquidity risk is reviewed monthly for the bank and the parent company  as well as its subsidiaries 
in addition  liquidity working groups meet regularly to identify and monitor liquidity positions  provide policy guidance  review funding strategies  and oversee the adherence to  and maintenance of  the contingency funding plans

sources of wholesale funding include other domestic time deposits of  or more  brokered deposits and negotiable cds  deposits in foreign offices  short term borrowings  fhlb advances  other long term debt  and subordinated notes 
at december   total wholesale funding was billion  a decrease from billion at december  the decrease from prior year primarily relates to a decrease in short term borrowings  subordinated and other long term debt  partially offset by an increase in fhlb borrowings 
the amounts included in wholesale funding at december   had a weighted average maturity of years 
the bank also has access to the federal reserve s discount window 
these borrowings are secured by commercial loans and home equity lines of credit 
the bank is also a member of the fhlb  and as such  has access to advances from this facility 
these advances are generally secured by residential mortgages  other mortgage related loans  and available for sale securities 
information regarding amounts pledged  for the ability to borrow if necessary  and the unused borrowing capacity at both the federal reserve bank and the fhlb  is outlined in the following table table federal reserve bank and fhlb borrowing capacity december  dollar amounts in billions loans and securities pledged federal reserve bank fhlb total loans and securities pledged total unused borrowing capacity at federal reserve bank and fhlb in  huntington transferred automobile loans totaling billion to trusts in two separate securitization transactions and received a total of billion of net proceeds

million of these redeemed trust preferred securities were redeemed at the redemption price as a percentage of the liquidation amount plus accrued and unpaid distributions to the redemption date  and million were redeemed at par value 
these redemptions were funded from our existing cash and resulted in a net gain of million 
on january   we announced that the board of directors had declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of per common share 
the dividend is payable on april   to shareholders of record on march  based on the current quarterly dividend of per common share  cash demands required for common stock dividends are estimated to be approximately million per quarter 
based on the current dividend  cash demands required for series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock are estimated to be approximately million and million  respectively  per quarter 
based on a regulatory dividend limitation  the bank could not have declared and paid a dividend to the parent company at december   without regulatory approval due to the deficit position of its undivided profits 
we do not anticipate that the bank will request regulatory approval to pay dividends in the near future as we continue to build bank regulatory capital above its already well capitalized level 
to help meet any additional liquidity needs  we have an open ended  automatic shelf registration statement filed and effective with the sec  which permits us to issue an unspecified amount of debt or equity securities 
other parent company obligations due in the next months include a million subordinated note due in april with the exception of the items discussed above  the parent company does not have any significant cash demands 
it is our policy to keep operating cash on hand at the parent company to satisfy expected cash demands for the next months 
we sponsor a non contributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees hired or rehired prior to january  the plan provides benefits based upon length of service and compensation levels 
our policy is to contribute an annual amount that is at least equal to the minimum funding requirements 
the bank and other subsidiaries fund approximately of pension contributions 
although we contributed a total of million in  there was no required minimum contribution for funding requirements are calculated annually as of the end of the year and are heavily dependent on the value of our pension plan assets and the interest rate used to discount plan obligations 
to the extent that the low interest rate environment continues  including as a result of the federal reserve maturity extension program  or the pension plan does not earn the expected asset return rates  annual pension contribution requirements in future years could increase and such increases could be significant 
any additional pension contributions are not expected to significantly impact liquidity 
see the contractual obligations table for our pension minimum funding requirement 

table of contents basel iii includes short term liquidity liquidity coverage ratio and long term funding net stable funding ratio standards 
the liquidity coverage ratio  or lcr  is designed to ensure that banking organizations maintain an adequate level of cash  or assets that can readily be converted to cash  to meet potential short term liquidity needs 
on january   the basel committee on banking supervision bcbs issued a final standard on the liquidity coverage ratio 
the final standard delays full implementation of the lcr 
partial implementation begins on january  with of the high quality liquid assets requirement and increases ratably until full implementation of the lcr effective january  the net stable funding ratio  which is scheduled to take effect by january   is designed to promote a stable maturity structure of assets and liabilities of banking organizations over a one year time horizon 
these requirements are subject to change by our banking regulators 
considering the factors discussed above  and other analyses that we have performed  we believe the parent company has sufficient liquidity to meet its cash flow obligations for the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we enter into various off balance sheet arrangements 
these arrangements include financial guarantees contained in standby letters of credit issued by the bank and commitments by the bank to sell mortgage loans 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
these guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements  including commercial paper  bond financing  and similar transactions 
most of these arrangements mature within two years and are expected to expire without being drawn upon 
standby letters of credit are included in the determination of the amount of risk based capital that the parent company and the bank are required to hold 
through our credit process  we monitor the credit risks of outstanding standby letters of credit 
when it is probable that a standby letter of credit will be drawn and not repaid in full  losses are recognized in the provision for credit losses 
at december   we had million of standby letters of credit outstanding  of which were collateralized 
included in this million total are letters of credit issued by the bank that support securities that were issued by our customers and remarketed by the huntington investment company  our broker dealer subsidiary 
we enter into forward contracts relating to the mortgage banking business to hedge the exposures we have from commitments to extend new residential mortgage loans to our customers and from our mortgage loans held for sale 
at december   and december   we had commitments to sell residential real estate loans of million and million  respectively 
these contracts mature in less than one year 
we do not believe that off balance sheet arrangements will have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources

table of contents operational risk as with all companies  we are subject to operational risk 
operational risk is the risk of loss due to human error  inadequate or failed internal systems and controls  violations of  or noncompliance with  laws  rules  regulations  prescribed practices  or ethical standards  and external influences such as market conditions  fraudulent activities  disasters  and security risks 
we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with laws  rules  and regulations  and to improve the oversight of our operational risk 
for example  we actively and continuously monitor cyber attacks such as attempts related to efraud and loss of sensitive customer data 
we constantly evaluate internal systems  processes and controls to mitigate loss from cyber attacks and  to date  have not experienced any material losses 
to mitigate operational risks  we have established a senior management operational risk committee and a senior management legal  regulatory  and compliance committee 
the responsibilities of these committees  among other duties  include establishing and maintaining management information systems to monitor material risks and to identify potential concerns  risks  or trends that may have a significant impact and ensuring that recommendations are developed to address the identified issues 
both of these committees report any significant findings and recommendations to the risk management committee 
additionally  potential concerns may be escalated to our roc  as appropriate 
the goal of this framework is to implement effective operational risk techniques and strategies  minimize operational and fraud losses  and enhance our overall performance 
representation and warranty reserve we primarily conduct our mortgage loan sale and securitization activity with fnma and fhlmc 
in connection with these and other securitization transactions  we make certain representations and warranties that the loans meet certain criteria  such as collateral type and underwriting standards 
we may be required to repurchase individual loans and or indemnify these organizations against losses due to a loan not meeting the established criteria 
we have a reserve for such losses  which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities 
the reserves are estimated based on historical and expected repurchase activity  average loss rates  and current economic trends 
the level of mortgage loan repurchase losses depends upon economic factors  investor demand strategies and other external conditions containing a level of uncertainty and risk that may change over the life of the underlying loans 
we currently do not have sufficient information to estimate the range of reasonably possible loss related to representation and warranty exposure 
the tables below reflect activity in the representations and warranties reserve table summary of reserve for representations and warranties on mortgage loans serviced for others year ended december  dollar amounts in thousands reserve for representations and warranties  beginning of year assumed reserve for representations and warranties reserve charges provision for representations and warranties reserve for representations and warranties  end of year table mortgage loan repurchase statistics year ended december  dollar amounts in thousands number of loans sold amount of loans sold upb number of loans repurchased amount of loans repurchased upb number of claims received successful dispute rate number of make whole payments amount of make whole payments 
table of contents loans repurchased are loans that fail to meet the purchaser s terms 
successful disputes are a percent of close out requests 
make whole payments are payments to reimburse for losses on foreclosed properties 
foreclosure documentation compared to the high volume servicers  we service a relatively low volume of residential mortgage foreclosures 
we have reviewed our residential foreclosure process 
we have not found evidence of financial injury to any borrowers from any foreclosure by the bank that should not have proceeded 
we continuously review our processes and controls to ensure that our foreclosure processes are appropriate 
compliance risk financial institutions are subject to several laws  rules  and regulations at both the federal and state levels 
these broad based mandates include  but are not limited to  expectations relating to anti money laundering  lending limits  client privacy  fair lending  and community reinvestment 
additionally  the volume and complexity of recent regulatory changes have increased our overall compliance risk 
as such  we utilize various resources to help ensure expectations are met  including a team of compliance experts dedicated to ensuring our conformance with all applicable laws  rules  and regulations 
our colleagues receive training for several broad based laws and regulations including  but not limited to  anti money laundering and customer privacy 
additionally  colleagues engaged in lending activities receive training for laws and regulations related to flood disaster protection  equal credit opportunity  fair lending  and or other courses related to the extension of credit 
we set a high standard of expectation for adherence to compliance management and seek to continuously enhance our performance 
capital this section should be read in conjunction with note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
both regulatory capital and shareholders equity are managed at the bank and on a consolidated basis 
we have an active program for managing capital and maintain a comprehensive process for assessing the company s overall capital adequacy 
we believe our current levels of both regulatory capital and shareholders equity are adequate 
regulatory capital basel iii and the dodd frank act in june  the frb  occ  and fdic collectively  the agencies each issued nprs that would revise and replace the agencies current capital rules to align with the basel iii capital standards and meet certain requirements of the dodd frank act 
certain requirements of the nprs would establish more restrictive capital definitions  higher risk weightings for certain asset classes  capital buffers and higher minimum capital ratios 
the nprs were in a comment period through october   and those comments are currently being evaluated by the agencies 
in late  the agencies announced that implementation of the basel iii requirements would be delayed as certain aspects of the nprs were to be enacted in at the time of the npr release  we evaluated the impact of the nprs as proposed on our regulatory capital ratios and estimated a reduction of approximately basis points to our basel i tier i common risk based capital ratio based on our june   balance sheet composition 
we anticipate that our capital ratios  on a basel iii basis  would continue to exceed the well capitalized minimum requirements 
we are evaluating options to mitigate the capital impact of the nprs and will provide further guidance upon issuance of the final rules by the agencies 
capital planning in connection with its increased focus on the adequacy of regulatory capital and risk management for larger financial institutions  the frb requires banks with assets over billion to submit capital plans annually 
per the frb s rule  our submission included a comprehensive capital plan supported by an assessment of expected uses and sources of capital over a given planning time period under a range of expected and stress scenarios 
we participated in the frb s cappr process and made our capital plan submission in january on march   we announced that the frb had completed its review of our capital plan submission and did not object to our proposed capital actions 
the planned actions included the potential repurchase of up to million of common stock and a continuation of our current common dividend through the first quarter 

table of contents in october  the federal reserve published two final rules with stress testing requirements for certain bank holding companies  state member banks  and savings and loan holding companies 
we will be subject to the federal reserve s supervisory stress tests beginning in late  however as in the prior year  we are subject to cappr and must conduct internal stress testing as part of the completion of our annual capital plan 
we submitted our capital plan to the federal reserve on january   in accordance with the federal reserve s requirements 
in october  the occ issued its annual stress test final rule 
in that ruling  the occ stipulated it will consult closely with the federal reserve to provide common stress scenarios for use at both the depository institution and holding company levels 
the occ has deferred the requirement for us to complete separate annual stress tests at the bank level until for additional discussion  refer to the updates to risk factors section located in the additional disclosures section of this md a 
capital adequacy the frb establishes capital adequacy requirements  including well capitalized standards for the company 
the occ establishes similar capital adequacy requirements and standards for the bank 
regulatory capital primarily consists of tier risk based capital and tier risk based capital 
the sum of tier risk based capital and tier risk based capital equals our total risk based capital 
risk based capital guidelines require a minimum level of capital as a percentage of risk weighted assets 
risk weighted assets consist of total assets plus certain off balance sheet and market items  subject to adjustment for predefined credit risk factors 
throughout  both the company and the bank were well capitalized under applicable regulatory capital adequacy guidelines 
tier common equity  a non gaap financial measure  is used by banking regulators  investors and analysts to assess and compare the quality and composition of our capital with the capital of other financial services companies 
we use tier common equity  along with the other capital measures  to assess and monitor our capital position 
tier common equity is defined as tier capital less elements of tier capital not in the form of common equity eg perpetual preferred stock  noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries  and trust preferred capital debt securities 
the following table presents risk weighted assets and other financial data necessary to calculate certain financial ratios  including the tier common equity ratio  which we use to measure capital adequacy table consolidated capital adequacy december  dollar amounts in millions consolidated capital calculations common shareholders equity preferred shareholders equity total shareholders equity goodwill other intangible assets other intangible asset deferred tax liability total tangible equity preferred shareholders equity total tangible common equity total assets goodwill other intangible assets other intangible asset deferred tax liability total tangible assets tier capital preferred shareholders equity trust preferred securities reit preferred stock tier common equity risk weighted assets rwa tier common equity rwa ratio tangible equity tangible asset ratio tangible common equity tangible asset ratio tangible common equity rwa ratio 
table of contents intangible assets are net of deferred tax liability and calculated assuming a tax rate 
tangible equity  tier common equity  tangible common equity  and tangible assets are non gaap financial measures 
additionally  any ratios utilizing these financial measures are also non gaap 
these financial measures have been included as they are considered to be critical metrics with which to analyze and evaluate financial condition and capital strength 
other companies may calculate these financial measures differently 
our tier common equity risk based ratio improved basis points to at december   compared with at december  this increase primarily reflected the combination of an increase in retained earnings and a reduction in the disallowed tax deferred asset  partially offset by an increase in risk weighted assets of billion  the repurchase of million common shares  and the impacts related to the payments of dividends

shareholders equity we generate shareholders equity primarily through earnings  net of dividends 
other potential sources of shareholders equity include issuances of common and preferred stock 
our objective is to maintain capital at an amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance objectives  to meet both regulatory and market expectations  and to provide the flexibility needed for future growth and business opportunities 
shareholders equity totaled billion at december   representing a billion  or  increase compared with december   primarily due to an increase in retained earnings 

table of contents dividends we consider disciplined capital management as a key objective  with dividends representing one component 
our strong capital ratios and expectations for continued earnings growth positions us to continue to actively explore additional capital management opportunities 
on january   our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per common share  payable in april cash dividends of per common share were also declared on january   april   july   and october  our capital plan to the frb see capital planning section above included the continuation of our current common dividend through the first quarter 
on january   our board of directors also declared a quarterly cash dividend on our series a non cumulative perpetual convertible preferred stock of per share 
the dividend is payable in april cash dividends of per share were also declared on january   april   july   and october  on january   our board of directors also declared a quarterly cash dividend on our floating rate series b non cumulative perpetual preferred stock of per share 
the dividend is payable in april cash dividends of per share  per share  per share  and per share were also declared on january   april   july   and october   respectively 
share repurchases from time to time the board of directors authorizes the company to repurchase shares of our common stock 
although we announce when the board authorizes share repurchases  we typically do not give any public notice before we repurchase our shares 
future stock repurchases may be private or open market repurchases  including block transactions  accelerated or delayed block transactions  forward transactions  and similar transactions 
various factors determine the amount and timing of our share repurchases  including our capital requirements  the number of shares we expect to issue for employee benefit plans and acquisitions  market conditions including the trading price of our stock  and regulatory and legal considerations  including the frb s response to our capital plan 
our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program consistent with our capital plan 
during  we repurchased million common shares at a weighted average share price of 
no shares were repurchased in other capital matters tarp capital in  we fully exited our tarp relationship by repurchasing for million the ten year warrant we had issued to the treasury as part of the tarp 
refer to the form k for a complete discussion regarding the repayment of our tarp capital 

table of contents business segment discussion overview we have four major business segments retail and business banking  regional and commercial banking  automobile finance and commercial real estate  and wealth advisors  government finance  and home lending 
a treasury other function also includes our insurance business and other unallocated assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
while this section reviews financial performance from a business segment perspective  it should be read in conjunction with the discussion of results of operations  note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and other sections for a full understanding of our consolidated financial performance 
business segment results are determined based upon our management reporting system  which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments 
the process is designed around our organizational and management structure and  accordingly  the results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions 
optimal customer relationship ocr our ocr initiative is a cross business segment strategy designed to increase overall customer profitability and retention by deepening product and service penetration to consumer and commercial customers 
we believe this can be accomplished by taking our broad array of services and products and delivering them through a rigorous and disciplined sales management process that is consistent across all business segments and regions 
it is also supported by robust sales and cross referral technology 
ocr was introduced in late through  much of the effort was spent on defining processes  sales training  and systems development to fully capture and measure ocr performance metrics 
in  we introduced ocr related metrics for commercial relationships  which complements the previously disclosed consumer ocr related metrics 
in  we continued to experience strong consumer household and commercial relationship growth 
consumer ocr performance for consumer ocr performance there are three key performance metrics the number of checking account households  the number of product penetration per consumer checking account household  and the revenue generated 
consumer households from all business segments are included 
the growth in consumer checking account number of households is a result of both new sales of checking accounts and improved retention of existing checking account households 
the overall objective is to grow the number of households  along with an increase in product penetration 
we use the checking account since it typically represents the primary banking relationship product 
we count additional products by type  not number of products 
for example  a household that has one checking account and one mortgage  we count as having two services 
a household with four checking accounts  we count as having one service 
the household relationship utilizing four or more services is viewed to be more profitable and loyal 
the overall objective  therefore  is to decrease the percentage of services per consumer checking account household  while increasing the percentage of those with or more services 
the following table presents consumer checking account household ocr metrics table consumer checking household ocr cross sell report year ended december number of households product penetration by number of services service services services total revenue in millions 
table of contents our emphasis on cross sell  coupled with customers increasingly being attracted by the benefits offered through our fair play banking philosophy with programs such as hour grace on overdrafts and asterisk free checking  are having a positive effect 
the percent of consumer households with over four products at the end of was  up from at the end of last year 
for  consumer checking account households grew 
total consumer checking account household revenue in was million  down million  or  from household revenue was negatively impacted by a decrease in electronic banking income as a result of the durbin amendment 
commercial ocr performance for commercial ocr performance  there are three key performance metrics the number of commercial relationships  the number of services penetration per commercial relationship  and the revenue generated 
commercial relationships include relationships from all business segments 
the growth in the number of commercial relationships is a result of both new sales of checking accounts and improved retention of existing commercial accounts 
the overall objective is to grow the number of relationships  along with an increase in product service distribution 
the commercial relationship is defined as a business banking or commercial banking customer with a checking account relationship 
we use this metric because we believe that the checking account anchors a business relationship and creates the opportunity to increase our cross sell 
multiple sales of the same type of product are counted as one product  the same as consumer 
the following table presents commercial relationship ocr metrics table commercial relationship ocr cross sell report year ended december  commercial relationships product penetration by number of services service services services total revenue in millions by focusing on targeted relationships we are able to achieve higher product service distribution among our commercial relationships 
our expanded product offerings allow us to focus not only on the credit driven relationship  but leverage these relationships to generate a deeper share of wallet 
the percent of commercial relationships utilizing over four products at the end of was  up from from the prior year 
for  commercial relationships grew 
total commercial relationship revenue in was million  up million  or  from this was primarily driven by increase in loan balances and increased spreads 
revenue sharing revenue is recorded in the business segment responsible for the related product or service 
fee sharing is recorded to allocate portions of such revenue to other business segments involved in selling to  or providing service to  customers 
results of operations for the business segments reflect these fee sharing allocations 
expense allocation the management accounting process that develops the business segment reporting utilizes various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments 
expenses are allocated to business segments using a two phase approach 
the first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs activity based costs to activities related to product origination and servicing 
these activity based costs are then extended  based on volumes  with the resulting amount allocated to business segments that own the related products 
the second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to all four business segments from treasury other 
we utilize a full allocation methodology  where all treasury other expenses  except those related to our insurance business  reported significant items except for the goodwill impairment  and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses  are allocated to the four business segments 

table of contents funds transfer pricing ftp we use an active and centralized ftp methodology to attribute appropriate net interest income to the business segments 
the intent of the ftp methodology is to eliminate all interest rate risk from the business segments by providing matched duration funding of assets and liabilities 
the result is to centralize the financial impact  management  and reporting of interest rate and liquidity risk in the treasury other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed 
the treasury other function charges credits an internal cost of funds for assets held in or pays for funding provided by each business segment 
the ftp rate is based on prevailing market interest rates for comparable duration assets or liabilities  and includes an estimate for the cost of liquidity liquidity premium 
deposits of an indeterminate maturity receive an ftp credit based on a combination of vintage based average lives and replicating portfolio pool rates 
other assets  liabilities  and capital are charged credited with a four year moving average ftp rate 
the denominator in the net interest margin calculation has been modified to add the amount of net funds provided by each business segment for all periods presented 
treasury other the treasury other function includes revenue and expense related to our insurance business  and assets  liabilities  and equity not directly assigned or allocated to one of the four business segments 
other assets include investment securities and bank owned life insurance 
the financial impact associated with our ftp methodology  as described above  is also included 
net interest income includes the impact of administering our investment securities portfolios and the net impact of derivatives used to hedge interest rate sensitivity 
noninterest income includes insurance income  miscellaneous fee income not allocated to other business segments  such as bank owned life insurance income and any investment security and trading asset gains or losses 
noninterest expense includes any insurance related expenses  as well as certain corporate administrative  merger  and other miscellaneous expenses not allocated to other business segments 
the provision for income taxes for the business segments is calculated at a statutory tax rate  though our overall effective tax rate is lower 
as a result  treasury other reflects a credit for income taxes representing the difference between the lower actual effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate used to allocate income taxes to the business segments 
the million  or  year over year increase in net income for treasury other was primarily the result of the ftp process described above  partially offset by an increase in personnel costs

table of contents non regulatory capital ratios in addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators  the company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy  including tangible common equity to tangible assets  tier common equity to risk weighted assets using basel i and basel iii definitions  and tangible common equity to risk weighted assets using basel i definition 
these non regulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions 
additionally  presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare the company s capitalization to other financial services companies 
these ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes preferred securities  the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies 
these ratios are not defined in generally accepted accounting principles gaap or federal banking regulations 
as a result  these non regulatory capital ratios disclosed by the company may be considered non gaap financial measures 
because there are no standardized definitions for these non regulatory capital ratios  the company s calculation methods may differ from those used by other financial services companies 
also  there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors 
as a result  the company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this form k in their entirety  and not to rely on any single financial measure 
risk factors more information on risk is set forth under the heading risk factors included in item a and incorporated by reference into this md a 
additional information regarding risk factors can also be found in the risk management and capital discussion  as well as the regulatory matters section included in item and incorporated by reference into the md a 
critical accounting policies and use of significant estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  which is incorporated by reference into this md a  describes the significant accounting policies we use in our consolidated financial statements 
an accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time  and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates 
the most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below 
allowance for credit losses our acl of billion at december   represents our estimate of probable credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio and our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit 
we regularly review our acl for appropriateness by performing on going evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio 
in doing so  we consider factors such as the differing economic risk associated with each loan category  the financial condition of specific borrowers  the level of delinquent loans  the value of any collateral and  where applicable  the existence of any guarantees or other documented support 
we also evaluate the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our acl at each reporting date 
there is no certainty that our acl will be appropriate over time to cover losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy  market conditions  or events adversely affecting specific customers  industries  or markets 
if the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates  the risk profile of a market  industry  or group of customers changes materially  or if the acl is not appropriate  our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents in addition  bank regulators periodically review our acl and may require us to increase our provision for loan and lease losses or loan charge offs 
any increase in our acl or loan charge offs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill impairment goodwill is an intangible asset representing the difference between the purchase price of an asset and its fair market value and is created when a company pays a premium to acquire another company 
we test goodwill for impairment annually  as of october  using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of each reporting unit 
goodwill impairment exists when a reporting unit s carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
goodwill is also tested for impairment on an interim basis  using the same two step process as the annual testing  if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the first step step of impairment testing requires comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with goodwill to its carrying value to identify potential impairment 
for our annual impairment testing conducted during  we identified four reporting units with goodwill retail and business banking  regional and commercial banking  wealth advisors  government finance  and home lending wgh  and insurance 
auto finance and commercial real estate was not subject to impairment testing as it had no goodwill associated with the unit 
in addition  although insurance is included within treasury other for business segment reporting  it was evaluated as a separate reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing because it had its own separately allocated goodwill resulting from prior acquisitions 
for all four reporting units identified in the above paragraph  we utilized both income and market approaches to determine the fair value for each reporting unit 
the income approach was based on discounted cash flows derived from assumptions of balance sheet and income statement activity 
an internal forecast was developed by considering several long term key business drivers such as anticipated loan and deposit growth  net interest margins  and efficiency ratios 
long term growth rates were estimated to assist in determining the terminal values 
the discount rates were estimated based on the capital asset pricing model  which considered the risk free interest rate year treasury bonds  market risk premium  equity risk premium  and a company specific risk factor 
the company specific risk factor was used to address the uncertainty of growth estimates and earnings projections of management 
for the market approach  revenue  earnings and market capitalization multiples of comparable public companies were selected and applied to each reporting unit s applicable metrics such as book and tangible book values 
the results of the income and market approaches are combined to arrive at the final calculation of fair value 
the aggregate fair market value of the reporting units compared with market capitalization indicated an implied premium of at september  a control premium analysis indicated that the implied premium was within range of overall premiums observed in the market place 
all four of the reporting units tested passed step the second step step of impairment testing is necessary only if the reporting unit does not pass step step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill for the reporting unit 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as goodwill that is recognized in a business combination 
significant judgment and estimates are involved in estimating the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
as none of the reporting units failed step  step was not applicable during testing 
significant judgment is applied when goodwill is assessed for impairment 
this judgment includes developing cash flow projections  selecting appropriate discount rates  identifying relevant market comparables  incorporating general economic and market conditions  and selecting an appropriate control premium 
the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value 
judgment is applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of fair value 
due to potential economic uncertainties  it is possible that our estimates and assumptions may adversely change in the future 
if our market capitalization decreases  we may be required to record goodwill impairment losses in future periods  whether in connection with our next annual impairment testing or prior to that time  if any changes constitute a triggering event 
valuation of financial instruments assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility 
assets measured at fair value include mortgage loans held for sale  available for sale and trading securities  certain securitized automobile loans  derivatives  and certain securitization trust notes payable 
at december   approximately billion of our assets and billion of our liabilities were recorded at fair value 
in addition to the above mentioned on going fair value measurements  fair value is also the unit of measure for recording business combinations 
at the end of each quarter  we assess the valuation hierarchy for each asset or liability measured at fair value 
as necessary  assets or liabilities may be transferred within fair value hierarchy levels due to changes in availability of observable market inputs to measure fair value at the measurement date 

table of contents where available  we use quoted market prices to determine fair value 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair value is determined  using either internally developed or independent third party valuation models  based on inputs that are either directly observable or derived from market data 
these inputs include  but are not limited to  interest rate yield curves  option volatilities  or option adjusted spreads 
where neither quoted market prices nor observable market data are available  fair value is determined using valuation models that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs based on management s expectation that market participants would use in determining the fair value of the asset or liability 
the determination of appropriate unobservable inputs requires exercise of management judgment 
a significant portion of our assets and liabilities that are reported at fair value are measured based on quoted market prices and observable market or independent inputs 
the following is a description of the significant estimates used in the valuation of financial assets and liabilities for which quoted market prices and observable market parameters are not available 
mortgage backed and asset backed securities our alt a  private label cmo and pooled trust preferred securities portfolios are classified as level and as such use significant estimates to determine the fair value of these securities which results in greater subjectivity 
the alt a and private label cmo securities portfolios are subjected to a monthly review of the projected cash flows  while the cash flows of our pooled trust preferred securities portfolio are reviewed quarterly 
these reviews are supported with analysis from independent third parties  and are used as a basis for impairment analysis 
alt a mortgage backed and private label cmo securities are collateralized by first lien residential mortgage loans 
the securities valuation methodology incorporates values obtained from a third party pricing specialist using a discounted cash flow approach and a proprietary pricing model and includes assumptions management believes market participants would use to value the securities under current market conditions 
the model uses inputs such as estimated prepayment speeds  losses  recoveries  default rates that are implied by the underlying performance of collateral in the structure or similar structures  house price depreciation appreciation rates that are based upon macroeconomic forecasts and discount rates that are implied by market prices for similar securities with similar collateral structures 
pooled trust preferred securities are cdos backed by a pool of debt securities issued by financial institutions 
the collateral generally consists of trust preferred securities and subordinated debt securities issued by banks  bank holding companies  and insurance companies 
a full cash flow analysis is used to estimate fair values and assess impairment for each security within this portfolio 
we engage a third party pricing specialist with direct industry experience in pooled trust preferred securities valuations to provide assistance in estimating the fair value and expected cash flows for each security in this portfolio 
the pd of each issuer and the market discount rate are the most significant inputs in determining fair value 
management evaluates the pd assumptions provided by the third party pricing specialist by comparing the current pd to the assumptions used the previous quarter  actual defaults and deferrals in the current period  and trend data on certain financial ratios of the issuers 
huntington also evaluates the assumptions related to discount rates 
relying on cash flows is necessary because there was a lack of observable transactions in the market and many of the original sponsors or dealers for these securities are no longer able to provide a fair value that is compliant with asc derivatives used for hedging purposes derivatives designated as qualified hedges are tested for hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis 
assessments are made at the inception of the hedge and on a recurring basis to determine whether the derivative used in the hedging transaction has been and is expected to continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item 
a statistical regression analysis is performed to measure the effectiveness 
if  based on the assessment  a derivative is not expected to be a highly effective hedge or it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge  hedge accounting is discontinued as of the quarter the hedge is not highly effective 
as the statistical regression analysis requires the use of estimates regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows which are sensitive to significant changes in future periods based on changes in market rates  we consider this a critical accounting estimate 
loans held for sale certain residential mortgage loans are classified as held for sale at origination in which huntington has elected to apply the fair value option 
the fair value is estimated based on security prices for similar product types 
certain consumer and commercial loans are classified as held for sale and are accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value 
the determination of fair value for these consumer receivables is based on security prices for similar product types or discounted expected cash flows  which takes into consideration factors such as future interest rates  prepayment speeds  default and loss curves  and market discount rates 
the determination of fair value for commercial loans takes into account factors such as the location and appraised value of the related collateral  as well as the estimated cash flows from realization of the collateral 

table of contents mortgage servicing rights retained rights to service mortgage loans are recognized as a separate and distinct asset at the time the loans are sold 
mortgage servicing rights msrs are initially recorded at fair value at the time the related loans are sold and subsequently re measured at each reporting date under either the fair value or amortization method 
any increase or decrease in fair value of msrs accounted for under the fair value method  as well as any amortization and or impairment of msrs recorded under the amortization method  is reflected in earnings in the period that the changes occur 
msrs are subject to interest rate risk in that their fair value will fluctuate as a result of changes in the interest rate environment 
fair value is determined based upon the application of an income approach valuation model based 
the valuation model  maintained by an independent third party  incorporates assumptions in estimating future cash flows 
these assumptions include time decay  payoffs  and changes in valuation inputs and assumptions 
the reasonableness of these pricing models is validated on a minimum of a quarterly basis by at least one independent external service broker valuation 
because the fair values of msrs are significantly impacted by the use of estimates  the use of different assumption estimates can result in different estimated fair values of those msrs 
pension valuation pension plan assets consist of mutual funds  corporate bonds  us government bonds and our common stock 
investments are accounted for at cost on the trade date and are reported at fair value 
mutual funds are valued at quoted net asset value 
our common stock is traded on a national securities exchange and is valued at the last reported sales price 
the discount rate and expected return on plan assets used to determine the benefit obligation and pension expense are both significant assumptions 
actual results may be materially different 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
contingent liabilities we are parties to various claims  litigation  and legal proceedings resulting from ordinary business activities relating to our current and or former operations 
we estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be more or less than the current estimate 
our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case by case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering  among other factors  the progress of each case or proceeding  our experience and the experience of others in similar cases or proceedings  and the opinions and views of legal counsel 
litigation exposure represents a key area of judgment and is subject to uncertainty and certain factors outside of our control 
income taxes the calculation of our provision for income taxes is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments 
we have two accruals for income taxes our income tax payable represents the estimated net amount currently due to the federal  state  and local taxing jurisdictions  net of any reserve for potential audit issues  and is reported as a component of accrued income and other assets in our consolidated balance sheet  our deferred federal and state income tax and related valuation accounts  reported as a component of accrued income and other assets  represents the estimated impact of temporary differences between how we recognize our assets and liabilities under gaap  and how such assets and liabilities are recognized under federal and state tax law 
in the ordinary course of business  we operate in various taxing jurisdictions and are subject to income and non income taxes 
the effective tax rate is based in part on our interpretation of the relevant current tax laws 
we believe the aggregate liabilities related to taxes are appropriately reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
we review the appropriate tax treatment of all transactions taking into consideration statutory  judicial  and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax positions 
in addition  we rely on various tax opinions  recent tax audits  and historical experience 
from time to time  we engage in business transactions that may affect our tax liabilities 
where appropriate  we have obtained opinions of outside experts and have assessed the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of business transactions taking into account statutory  judicial  and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position 
however  changes to our estimates of accrued taxes can occur due to changes in tax rates  implementation of new business strategies  resolution of issues with taxing authorities regarding previously taken tax positions  and newly enacted statutory  judicial  and regulatory guidance 
such changes could affect the amount of our accrued taxes and could be material to our financial position and or results of operations 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents deferred tax assets at december   we had a net federal deferred tax asset of million and a net state deferred tax asset of million 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
all available evidence  both positive and negative  was considered to determine whether  based on the weight of that evidence  impairment should be recognized 
our forecast process includes judgmental and quantitative elements that may be subject to significant change
