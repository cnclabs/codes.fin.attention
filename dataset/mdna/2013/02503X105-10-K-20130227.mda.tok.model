item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is designed to provide a reader of american capital agency corp 
s consolidated financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management 
our md a is presented in five sections executive overview financial condition results of operations liquidity and capital resources forward looking statements executive overview the size and composition of our investment portfolio depends on investment strategies implemented by our manager  the availability of investment capital and overall market conditions  including the availability of attractively priced investments and suitable financing to appropriately leverage our investment portfolio 
market conditions are influenced by  among other things  current levels of and expectations for future levels of  interest rates  mortgage prepayments  market liquidity  housing prices  unemployment rates  general economic conditions  government participation in the mortgage market  evolving regulations or legal settlements that impact servicing practices or other mortgage related activities 
trends and recent market impacts on september   the federal reserve announced their third quantitative easing program  commonly known as qe  and extended their guidance to keep the federal funds rate at exceptional low levels through at least mid qe entails large scale purchases of agency mortgage backed securities at the pace of billion per month in addition to the federal reserve existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency mortgage backed securities into new agency mortgage backed security purchases 
the program is open ended in nature  and is intended to put downward pressure on longer term interest rates  support mortgage markets  and help make the broader financial conditions more accommodative 
the federal reserve plans to continue their purchases of agency mortgage backed securities and employ other policy tools  as appropriate  until they foresee substantial improvement in the outlook for the us labor market 
the federal reserve purchases are and likely will continue to be concentrated in newly issued  fixed rate agency mortgage backed securities ie  the part of the mortgage market with the greatest impact on mortgage rates offered to borrowers 
the combined total purchases of agency mortgage backed securities by the federal reserve were approximately billion per month during the fourth quarter of  representing approximately half of the average monthly gross issuance of fixed rate agency mortgage backed securities 
prices across the agency mortgage backed security spectrum generally increased following the federal reserve announcement of qe  with the lowest coupon year and year fixed rate agency mortgage backed securities outperforming higher coupon securities 
during the fourth quarter of  some of the initial gains reversed  however  as of december  prices generally remained above those seen prior to the announcement of qe the table below summarizes interest rates and prices of generic fixed rate agency mortgage backed securities as of the end of each respective quarter december  december  vs

we expect during periods in which the federal reserve purchases significant volumes of mortgages  yields on agency mortgage backed securities will be lower and refinancing volumes will be higher than would have been absent qe since returns on agency mortgage backed securities are highly sensitive to prepayment speeds  we have positioned our investment portfolio towards agency securities that we believe have favorable prepayment attributes 
as of december   of our fixed rate investment portfolio was comprised of agency securities backed by lower loan balance mortgages pools backed by original loan balances of up to  and loans originated under harp pools backed by refinance loans with original loan to value ratios of greater than  which we believe have a lower risk of prepayment relative to generic agency securities 
the remainder of our portfolio as of december  was primarily comprised of low coupon  new issuance fixed rate agency securities

summary of critical accounting estimates our critical accounting estimates relate to the recognition of interest income and the fair value of our investments and derivatives 
certain of these items involve estimates that require management to make judgments that are subjective in nature 
we rely on our manager experience and analysis of historical and current market data in order to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates 
under different conditions  we could report materially different amounts based on such estimates 
the remainder of our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report on form k 
interest income the effective yield on our agency securities is highly impacted by our estimate of future prepayments 
we accrue interest income based on the outstanding principal amount of our investment securities and their contractual terms and we amortize or accrete premiums and discounts associated with the purchase of investment securities into interest income over the projected lives of our securities  including contractual payments and estimated prepayments  using the interest method 
the weighted average cost basis of our securities as of december  was of par value  therefore  faster actual or projected prepayments can have a meaningful negative impact  while slower actual or projected prepayments can have a meaningful positive impact  on our asset yields 
future prepayment rates are difficult to predict and we rely on a third party service provider and our manager experience and analysis of historical and current market data in order to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates 
our third party service provider estimates prepayment speeds using models that incorporate the forward yield curve  current mortgage rates and mortgage rates of the outstanding loans  age and size of the outstanding loans  loan to value ratios  volatility and other factors 
we review the prepayment speeds estimated by the third party service and compare the results to market consensus prepayment speeds  if available 
we also consider historical prepayment speeds and current market conditions to validate the reasonableness of the prepayment speeds estimated by the third party service and  based on our manager s judgment  we may make adjustments to their estimates 
we review our actual and anticipated prepayment experience on at least a quarterly basis and effective yields are recalculated when differences arise between i our previously estimated future prepayments and ii actual prepayments to date plus current estimated future prepayments 
if the actual and estimated future prepayment experience differs from our prior estimate of prepayments  we are required to record an adjustment in the current period to the amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts for the cumulative difference in the effective yield through the reporting date 
the most significant factor impacting prepayment rates on our securities is changes to long term interest rates 
prepayment rates generally increase when interest rates fall and decrease when interest rates rise 
however  there are a variety of other factors that may impact the rate of prepayments on our securities 
prepayments can also occur when borrowers sell the property and use the sale proceeds to prepay the mortgage as part of a physical relocation 
in addition  changes to the gse underwriting standards  further modifications to existing us government sponsored programs such as harp  or the implementation of new programs can have a significant impact on the rate of prepayments 
further  gse buyouts of loans in imminent risk of default  loans that have been modified  or loans that have defaulted will generally be reflected as prepayments on agency securities and also increase the uncertainty around our estimates 
consequently  under different conditions  we could report materially different amounts 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this annual report on form k includes the estimated change in our net interest income should interest rates go up or down by and basis points  assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other and the current yield curve 
fair value of investment securities we estimate the fair value of our investment securities based on a market approach using level inputs from third party pricing services and non binding dealer quotes 
the third party pricing services use pricing models that incorporate such factors as coupons  primary and secondary mortgage rates  prepayment speeds  spread to the treasury and interest rate swap curves  convexity  duration  periodic and life caps and credit enhancements 
the dealer quotes incorporate common market pricing methods  including a spread measurement to the treasury or interest rate swap curve as well as underlying characteristics of the particular security including coupon  periodic and life caps  rate reset period  issuer  additional credit support and expected life of the security 
we generally obtain to quotes or prices referred to as marks per investment security 
we attempt to validate marks obtained from pricing services and broker dealers by comparing them to our recent completed transactions involving the same or similar securities on or near the reporting date 
changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of our investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently estimated 
derivative financial instruments hedging activity we maintain a risk management strategy  under which we may use a variety of derivative instruments to economically hedge some of our exposure to market risks  including interest rate and prepayment risk 
our risk management objective is to reduce fluctuations in net book value over a range of market conditions 
the principal instruments that we use to hedge a portion of our exposure to interest rate and prepayment risks are interest rate swaps and swaptions 
we also purchase or sell tbas and specified agency securities on a forward basis as well as us treasury securities and us treasury futures contracts  purchase or write put or call options on tba securities  and invest in other types of mortgage derivatives  such as interest only securities  and synthetic total return swaps  such as the markit ios synthetic total return swap index markit ios index 
we recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet  measured at fair value 
during the third quarter of  we elected to discontinue hedge accounting for our interest rate swaps 
accordingly  subsequent to the third quarter of  all changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments are reported in earnings in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income in gain loss on derivatives and other securities  net during the period in which they occur 
the use of derivatives creates exposure to credit risk relating to potential losses that could be recognized in the event that the counterparties to these instruments fail to perform their obligations under the contracts 
we attempt to minimize this risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings  monitoring positions with individual counterparties and adjusting posted collateral as required 
we estimate the fair value of interest rate swaps using a third party pricing model 
the third party pricing model incorporates such factors as the libor curve and the pay rate on our interest rate swaps 
we also incorporate both our own and our counterparties nonperformance risk in estimating the fair value of our interest rate swaps 
in considering the effect of nonperformance risk  we consider the impact of netting and credit enhancements  such as collateral postings and guarantees  and have concluded that our own and our counterparty risk is not significant to the overall valuation of these agreements 
we estimate the fair value of interest rate swaptions using a third party pricing model based on the fair value of the future interest rate swap that we have the option to enter into as well as the remaining length of time that we have to exercise the option  adjusted for non performance risk  if any

in determining the estimated weighted average years to maturity of our agency mbs and the yield on our agency mbs  we have assumed a weighted average cpr over the remaining life of our agency mbs portfolio of and as of december  and  respectively 
we amortize or accrete premiums and discounts associated with purchases of our agency mbs into interest income over the estimated life of our securities based on actual and projected cprs  using the effective yield method 
since the weighted average cost basis of our agency mbs portfolio was of par value as of december   slower actual and projected prepayments can have a meaningful positive impact on our asset yields  while faster actual or projected prepayments can have a meaningful negative impact on our asset yields

results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year in addition to the results presented in accordance with gaap  our results of operations discussed below include certain non gaap financial information  including adjusted net interest expense  net spread income and estimated taxable income and certain financial metrics derived from non gaap information  such as cost of funds and estimated undistributed taxable income 
by providing users of our financial information with such measures in addition to the related gaap measures  we believe it gives users greater transparency into the information used by our management in its financial and operational decision making and  in the case of estimated taxable income  information that is directly related to the amount of dividends we are required to distribute in order to maintain our reit qualification status 
however  because such measures are incomplete measures of our financial performance and involve differences from results computed in accordance with gaap  they should be considered as supplementary to  and not as a substitute for  our results computed in accordance with gaap 
in addition  because not all companies use identical calculations  our presentation of such non gaap measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
furthermore  estimated taxable income can include certain information that is subject to potential adjustments up to the time of filing our income tax returns  which occurs after the end of our calendar year

the increase in our average investment portfolio was a function of follow on equity raises during fiscal years and the decline in our average asset yield is reflective of the decline in long term interest rates of the period primarily due to the federal reserve quantitative easing measures and the result of our acquiring lower yielding securities due to changes in portfolio composition  reinvestment of proceeds received from principal repayments and deployment of capital from follow on equity raises 
we believe the impact of the decline in long term interest rates on our portfolio was partially mitigated by repositioning our portfolio into securities that our manager believes have more favorable prepayment attributes in a historically low rate environment 
our weighted average actual prepayment rate during the year was  a slight increase over the prior year  and our projected life cpr decreased by bps to a projected life cpr of as of december  from as of december   despite the bps decline in the average year fixed rate mortgage rate from december  to december  the following is a summary of the impact of changes from fiscal year to fiscal year in the principal elements of interest income in millions fiscal year vs

as of december   we had a net short tba and forward settling agency securities position of million notional value and at risk leverage of times including net unsettled securities 
interest expense and cost of funds interest expense of million for fiscal year was primarily comprised of interest expense on our repurchase agreements and the reclassification of accumulated oci into interest expense related to previously de designated interest rate swaps described further below 
when adjusted for other periodic swap expense included in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income in gain loss on derivative instruments and other securities  net  our adjusted net interest expense was million for fiscal year interest expense of million for fiscal year was primarily comprised of interest expense on our repurchase agreements and periodic swap costs for the period prior to hedge de designation 
when adjusted for other periodic swap expense included in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income in gain loss on derivative instruments and other securities  net  our adjusted net interest expense was million for fiscal year prior to the third quarter of  we entered into interest rate swap agreements typically with the intention of qualifying for hedge accounting under gaap 
however  as of september   we elected to discontinue hedge accounting for our interest rate swaps 
subsequent to our discontinuance of hedge accounting  the net deferred loss related to our de designated interest rate swaps is being reclassified from accumulated oci into interest expense on a straight line basis over the remaining term of each interest rate swap 
although the reclassification of accumulated oci into interest expense is similar to as if the interest rate swaps had not been de designated  the actual net periodic interest costs associated with our de designated interest rates swaps may be greater or less than the amounts reclassified into interest expense 
the difference  as well as net periodic interest costs on interest rate swaps that were never in a hedge designation  is reported in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income in gain loss on derivative instruments and other securities  net 
we refer to the sum of our total net periodic interest costs on our interest rate swaps and interest expense on our repurchase agreements and other debt as our adjusted net interest expense or as our cost of funds when stated as a percentage of our outstanding repurchase agreements and other debt balance 
our cost of funds does not include swap termination fees and costs associated with our other supplemental hedges  such as swaptions  short us treasury or tba positions

forward starting interest rate swaps do not impact our adjusted net interest expense and cost of funds until they commence accruing net interest settlements on their forward start dates 
we enter into forward starting interest rate swaps based on a variety of factors  including our manager view of the forward yield curve and the timing of potential changes in short term interest rates  time to deploy new capital  amount and timing of expirations of our existing interest swap portfolio and current and anticipated swap spreads 
as of december   we had billion of forward starting interest rate swaps outstanding with forward start dates through april and no interest rate swaps set to expire over the same period 
as of december   we had billion of forward starting interest rate swaps outstanding with forward start dates through may  compared to billion of interest rate swaps set to expire over the same time period 
the period over period increase in our adjusted net interest expense was largely attributable to the increase in our investment portfolio and the corresponding increase in our average repurchase agreements and other debt balances outstanding and a higher cost of funds 
our higher cost of funds was reflective of higher repurchase agreement financing repo rates and a higher ratio of interest rate swaps outstanding to repurchase agreements and other debt  which was partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average pay rate on our interest rate swaps 
our higher repo cost is primarily a function of higher repo rates in the market and extending the average original days to maturity of our repo funding to days as of december  from days as of december  the following is a summary of the impact of changes from fiscal year to fiscal year in the principal elements of our total adjusted net interest expense and cost of funds in millions fiscal year vs

we can treat dividends declared by september and paid by december as having been a distribution of our taxable income for our prior tax year spill back provision 
income as determined under gaap differs from income as determined under tax rules because of both temporary and permanent differences in income and expense recognition 
the primary differences are i unrealized gains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and other derivatives and securities marked to market in current income for gaap purposes  but excluded from taxable income until realized or settled  ii temporary differences related to the amortization of premiums paid on investments  iii timing differences in the recognition of certain realized gains and losses and iv permanent differences for excise tax expense

as of december   we had billion of forward starting interest rate swaps outstanding with forward start dates through june  compared to billion of interest rate swaps set to expire over the same time period 
the period over period increase in our adjusted net interest expense was largely attributable to the increase in our investment portfolio and the corresponding increase in our average repurchase agreements and other debt balances outstanding partially offset by a lower cost of funds 
our lower cost of funds was reflective of a decrease in the weighted average pay rate on our interest rate swaps  which was partially offset by a higher ratio of interest rate swaps outstanding to repurchase agreements and other debt

we use derivative instruments and other securities in addition to interest rate swaps to supplement our interest rate risk management strategies 
we increased our use of derivative instruments and other securities during fiscal year due to the overall increase in our investment portfolio and continued interest rate volatility

because the level of our borrowings can be adjusted on a daily basis  the level of cash and cash equivalents carried on the balance sheet is significantly less important than the potential liquidity available under our borrowing arrangements 
we currently believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources available for the acquisition of additional investments  repayments on borrowings  maintenance of any margin requirements and the payment of cash dividends as required for our continued qualification as a reit 
to qualify as a reit  we must distribute annually at least of our taxable income 
to the extent that we annually distribute all of our taxable income in a timely manner  we will generally not be subject to federal and state income taxes 
we currently expect to distribute all of our taxable income in a timely manner so that we are not subject to federal and state income taxes 
this distribution requirement limits our ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish or increase capital from operations 
equity capital to the extent we raise additional equity capital through follow on equity offerings  through our at the market offering program or under our dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan  we currently anticipate using cash proceeds from such transactions to purchase additional investment securities  to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our repurchase agreements and for other general corporate purposes 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to raise additional equity capital at any particular time or on any particular terms 
common stock repurchase in october  our board of directors adopted a plan that may provide for stock repurchases of up to million of our outstanding shares of common stock through december  shares of our common stock may be purchased in the open market  including through block purchases  or through privately negotiated transactions  or pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with rule b of the securities and exchange commission 
the timing  manner  price and amount of any repurchases will be determined at our discretion and the program may be suspended  terminated or modified at any time for any reason 
we intend to repurchase shares only when the purchase price is less than our estimate of our current net asset value per share of our common stock 
generally  when we repurchase our common stock at a discount to our net asset value  the net asset value of our remaining shares of common stock outstanding increases 
in addition  we do not intend to repurchase any shares from directors  officers or other affiliates 
the program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares and all repurchases will be made in accordance with sec rule b  which sets certain restrictions on the method  timing  price and volume of stock repurchases 
during fiscal year  we made open market purchases of million shares of our common stock at an average net repurchase price of per share  or million 
preferred stock offering pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  we are authorized to designate and issue up to million shares of preferred stock in one or more classes or series 
our board of directors has designated million shares as series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock series a preferred stock 
as of december   we have million of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock 
our board of directors may designate additional series of authorized preferred stock ranking junior to or in parity with our series a preferred stock or designate additional shares of series a preferred stock and authorize the issuance of such shares 
in april  we completed a public offering in which million shares of our series a preferred stock were sold to the underwriters at a price of per share 
upon completion of the offering we received proceeds  net of offering expenses  of approximately million 
our series a preferred stock has no stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption 
under certain circumstances upon a change of control  the series a preferred stock is convertible to shares of our common stock 
holders of series a preferred stock have no voting rights  except under limited conditions  and holders are entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends at a rate of per annum of the per share liquidation preference before holders of our common stock are entitled to receive any dividends 
shares of our series a preferred stock are redeemable at per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends whether or not declared exclusively at our option commencing on april   or earlier under certain circumstances intended to preserve our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
dividends are payable quarterly in arrears on the th day of each january  april  july and october 
as of december   we had declared all required quarterly dividends on the series a preferred stock

at the market offering program we have sales agreements with sales agents to publicly offer and sell shares of our common stock in privately negotiated and or at the market transactions from time to time 
the table below summarizes sales our common stock under such sales agreements during fiscal years  and in millions  except per share amounts at the market offering price received per share shares net proceeds fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year as of december   million shares remain available for issuance under our sales agreements 
dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan we sponsor a dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan through which stockholders may purchase additional shares of our common stock by reinvesting some or all of the cash dividends received on shares of our common stock 
stockholders may also make optional cash purchases of shares of our common stock subject to certain limitations detailed in the plan prospectus 
during the fiscal years and  we issued million and million shares under the plan for net cash proceeds of million and million  respectively 
during fiscal year  there were no shares issued under the plan 
as of december   million shares remain available for issuance under the plan 
debt capital as part of our investment strategy  we borrow against our investment portfolio pursuant to master repurchase agreements 
we expect that our borrowings under such master repurchase agreements will generally have maturities ranging up to one year  but may have maturities up to five years or longer 
our leverage may vary periodically depending on market conditions and our manager assessment of risk and returns 
we generally would expect our leverage to be within six to eleven times the amount of our stockholders equity 
however  under certain market conditions  we may operate at leverage levels outside of this range for extended periods of time 
our leverage ratio was times the amount of our stockholders equity as of december   including our total borrowings and net payables receivables for agency securities not yet settled 
our cost of borrowings under master repurchase agreements generally corresponds to libor plus or minus a margin and was as of december  following our election to discontinue accounting for our interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges under gaap as of september   we extended the terms of our repurchase agreements to reduce the roll risk associated with maturing repurchase agreements 
as of december   our repurchase agreements had a weighted average original days to maturity of days and had a remaining weighted average days to maturity of days 
to limit our exposure to counterparty credit risk  we diversify our funding across multiple counterparties and by counterparty region 
as of december   we had master repurchase agreements with financial institutions  subject to certain conditions  located throughout north america  europe and asia 
as of december   less than of our stockholders equity was at risk with any one repo counterparty  with the top five repo counterparties representing less than of our stockholders equity 
the table below includes a summary of our repurchase agreement funding by number of repo counterparties and counterparty region as of december  for further details regarding our borrowings under repurchase agreements and other debt as of december   please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
as of december  counter party region number of counter parties percent of repurchase agreement funding north america europe asia amounts available to be borrowed under our repurchase agreements are dependent upon lender collateral requirements and the lender s determination of the fair value of the securities pledged as collateral  which fluctuates with changes in interest rates  credit quality and liquidity conditions within the investment banking  mortgage finance and real estate industries 
in addition  our counterparties apply a haircut to our pledged collateral  which means our collateral is valued at slightly less than market value 
this haircut reflects the underlying risk of the specific collateral and protects our counterparty against a change in its value  but conversely subjects us to counterparty risk and limits the amount we can borrow against our investment securities 
our master repurchase agreements do not specify the haircut  rather haircuts are determined on an individual repurchase transaction basis 
throughout fiscal year  haircuts on our pledged collateral remained stable and as of december   our weighted average haircut was less than of the value of our collateral 
under our repurchase agreements  we may be required to pledge additional assets to the repurchase agreement counterparties in the event the estimated fair value of the existing pledged collateral under such agreements declines and such counterparties demand additional collateral a margin call  which may take the form of additional securities or cash 
specifically  margin calls would result from a decline in the value of our agency securities securing our repurchase agreements and prepayments on the mortgages securing such agency securities 
similarly  if the estimated fair value of our investment securities increases due to changes in interest rates or other factors  counterparties may release collateral back to us 
our repurchase agreements generally provide that the valuations for the agency mbs securing our repurchase agreements are to be obtained from a generally recognized source agreed to by the parties 
however  in certain circumstances under certain of our repurchase agreements our lenders have the sole discretion to determine the value of the agency mbs securing our repurchase agreements 
in such instances  our lenders are required to act in good faith in making such valuation determinations 
our repurchase agreements generally provide that in the event of a margin call  we must provide additional securities or cash on the same business day that a margin call is made if the lender provides us notice prior to the margin notice deadline on such day 
as of december   we have met all of our margin requirements and we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of billion and unpledged agency securities of billion available to settle our net payable for agency securities  meet margin calls on our repurchase agreements and derivative instruments and for other corporate purposes 
although we believe we will have adequate sources of liquidity available to us through repurchase agreement financing to execute our business strategy  there can be no assurances that repurchase agreement financing will be available to us upon the maturity of our current repurchase agreements to allow us to renew or replace our repurchase agreement financing on favorable terms or at all 
if our repurchase agreement lenders default on their obligations to resell the underlying agency securities back to us at the end of the term  we could incur a loss equal to the difference between the value of the agency securities and the cash we originally received 
to help manage the adverse impact of interest rate changes on the value of our investment portfolio as well as our cash flows  we maintain an interest rate risk management strategy under which we use derivative financial instruments 
in particular  we attempt to mitigate the risk of the cost of our variable rate liabilities increasing at a faster rate than the earnings of our long term fixed rate assets during a period of rising interest rates 
the principal derivative instruments that we use are interest rate swaps  supplemented with the use of interest rate swaptions  tba securities  us treasury securities  futures and other instruments 
please refer to notes and to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for further details regarding our use of derivative instruments 
our derivative agreements typically require that we pledge receive collateral on such agreements to from our counterparties in a similar manner as we are required to under our repurchase agreements 
however  our swaption agreements do not require our counterparties to post collateral to us in the event that such agreements increase in value 
our counterparties typically have the sole discretion to determine the value of the derivative instruments and the value of the collateral securing such instruments 
in the event of a margin call  we must generally provide additional collateral on the same business day 
tba dollar roll transactions we may also enter into tba dollar roll transactions as a means of investing in and financing agency securities 
tba dollar roll transactions represent a form of off balance sheet financing and are accounted for as derivative instruments in our accompanying consolidated financial statements in this form k 
inclusive of our net tba position as of december   our total at risk leverage  net of unsettled securities  was x our stockholders equity 
under certain market conditions it may be uneconomical for us to enter into or to roll our tba contracts and we may need to settle our obligations for cash and take delivery of the underlying securities 
our tba dollar roll contracts are also subject to margin requirements governed by the mortgage backed securities division mbsd of the fixed income clearing corporation and by our prime brokerage agreements  which may establish margin levels in excess of the mbsd 
such provisions require that we establish an initial margin based on the notional value of the tba contract  which is subject to increase if the estimated fair value of our tba contract or the estimated fair value of our collateral pledged declines 
the mbsd has the sole discretion to determine the value of our tba contracts and of the pledged collateral securing such contracts 
in the event of a margin call  we must generally provide additional collateral on the same business day 
settlement of our tba obligations and satisfying margin requirements could negatively impact our liquidity position  but since we do not use tba dollar roll transactions as our primary source of financing we believe that we will have adequate sources of liquidity to meet such obligations 
asset sales and tba eligible securities we maintain a portfolio of highly liquid agency mbs securities 
we may sell our agency mbs securities through the tba market by delivering securities into tba contracts for the sale of agency securities  subject to good delivery provisions promulgated by the securities industry and financial markets association sifma 
we may alternatively sell agency mbs securities that have more unique attributes on a specified basis when such securities trade at a premium over generic tba securities or if the securities are not otherwise eligible for tba delivery 
since the tba market is the second most liquid market second to the us treasury market  maintaining a significant level of agency mbs securities eligible for tba delivery enhances our liquidity profile and provides price support for our tba eligible securities in a rising interest rate scenario at or above generic tba prices 
as of december   approximately of our fixed rate agency mbs portfolio or approximately of our total agency mbs portfolio was eligible for tba delivery 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not maintain any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance  or special purpose or variable interest entities  established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
further  as of december   we had not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities or entered into any commitment or intent to provide funding to any such entities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in market factors such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risks that we are exposed to are interest rate risk  prepayment risk  spread risk  liquidity risk  extension risk and counterparty credit risk 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing liabilities  by affecting the spread between our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
changes in the general level of interest rates can also affect our periodic settlements of interest rate swaps and the value of our interest rate swaps  which impact our net income 
changes in the level of interest rates can also affect the rate of prepayments of our securities and the value of the agency securities that constitute our investment portfolio  which affects our net income and ability to realize gains from the sale of these assets and impacts our ability and the amount that we can borrow against these securities 
we may utilize a variety of financial instruments in order to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on our operations  including interest rate swap agreements  interest rate swaptions  interest rate cap or floor contracts and futures or forward contracts 
we may also purchase or short tba securities  us treasury securities and us treasury futures contracts  purchase or write put or call options on tba securities or we may invest in other types of mortgage derivative securities  such as interest only securities  and synthetic total return swaps  such as the markit ios index 
when we use these types of derivatives to hedge the risk of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities  we may be subject to certain risks  including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for payments to holders of our common stock and that the losses may exceed the amount we invested in the instruments 
our profitability and the value of our investment portfolio including derivatives used for economic hedging purposes may be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates including changes in the forward yield curve 
primary measures of an instrument price sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations are its duration and convexity 
the duration of our investment portfolio changes with interest rates and tends to increase when rates rise and decrease when rates fall 
this negative convexity generally increases the interest rate exposure of our investment portfolio in excess of what is measured by duration alone 
we estimate the duration and convexity of our portfolio using both a third party risk management system and market data 
we review the duration estimates from the third party model and may make adjustments based on our manager judgment 
these adjustments are intended to  in our manager opinion  better reflect the unique characteristics and market trading conventions associated with certain types of securities 
these adjustments generally result in shorter durations than what the unadjusted third party model would otherwise produce 
without these adjustments  in rising rate scenarios  the longer unadjusted durations may underestimate price projections on certain securities with slower prepayment characteristics  such as harp and lower loan balance securities  to a level below those of generic or tba securities 
however  in our manager judgment  because these securities are typically deliverable into tba contracts  the price of these securities is unlikely to drop below the tba price in rising rate scenarios 
the accuracy of the estimated duration of our portfolio and projected agency security prices depends on our manager assumptions and judgments 
our manager may discontinue making these duration adjustments in the future or may choose to make different adjustments 
other models could produce materially different results 
the table below quantifies the estimated changes in net interest income including periodic interest costs on our interest rate swaps and the estimated changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio including derivatives and other securities used for economic hedging purposes and in our net asset value should interest rates go up or down by and basis points  assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other and the current yield curve and includes the impact of both duration and convexity 
all changes in income and value in the table below are measured as percentage changes from the projected net interest income  investment portfolio value and net asset value at the base interest rate scenario 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates as of december  given the low level of interest rates  we also apply a floor of for all anticipated interest rates included in our analysis  such that any hypothetical interest rate decrease would have a limited positive impact on our funding costs beyond a certain level 
however  because estimated prepayment speeds are impacted to a lesser degree by this floor  it is expected that an increase in our prepayment speeds as a result of a hypothetical interest rate decrease would result in an acceleration of our premium amortization and could result in reinvestment of such prepaid principal into lower yielding assets 
actual results could differ materially from estimates  especially in the current market environment 
to the extent that these estimates or other assumptions do not hold true  which is likely in a period of high price volatility  actual results will likely differ materially from projections and could be larger or smaller than the estimates in the table below 
moreover  if different models were employed in the analysis  materially different projections could result 
lastly  while the tables below reflect the estimated impact of interest rate increases and decreases on a static portfolio  we may from time to time sell any of our agency securities as a part of our overall management of our investment portfolio 
percentage change in projected change in interest rate net interest income portfolio value net asset value basis points basis points basis points basis points estimated dollar change in net interest income expressed as a percent of net interest income based on asset yields and cost of funds as of december  includes the effect of periodic interest costs on our interest rate swaps that are not designated as hedges under us gaap  but excludes costs associated with our other supplemental hedges  such as swaptions and short us treasury or tba positions 
base case scenario assumes a forecasted cpr of as of december  rate shock scenarios assume a forecasted cpr of   and for the basis points  basis points  basis points and basis points scenarios  respectively 
estimated dollar change in net interest income does not include the one time impact of retroactive catch up premium amortization benefit cost due to an increase decrease in the forecasted cpr 
down rate scenarios assume a floor of for anticipated interest rates 
includes the effect of derivatives and other securities used for economic hedging purposes 
estimated dollar change in investment portfolio value expressed as a percent of the total fair value of our investment portfolio as of december  estimated dollar change in portfolio value expressed as a percent of stockholders equity  net of the series a preferred stock liquidation preference  as of december  prepayment risk premiums and discounts associated with the purchase of agency mbs are amortized or accreted into interest income over the projected lives of the securities  including contractual payments and estimated prepayments using the interest method 
changes to the gse underwriting standards  further modifications to existing us government sponsored programs such as harp  or the implementation of new programs could materially impact prepayment speeds 
in addition  gse buyouts of loans in imminent risk of default  loans that have been modified  or loans that have defaulted will generally be reflected as prepayments on agency securities and also increase the uncertainty around these estimates 
our policy for estimating prepayment speeds for calculating the effective yield is to evaluate published prepayment data for similar agency securities  market consensus and current market conditions 
if the actual prepayment experienced differs from our estimate of prepayments  we will be required to make an adjustment to the amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts that would have an impact on future income 
spread risk our available for sale securities are reflected at their estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in oci 
as of december   the fair value of these securities was billion 
when the market spread between the yield on our agency securities and us treasury securities or swap rates widens  the value of our agency securities and or our net book value could decline  creating what we refer to as spread risk 
the spread risk associated with our agency securities and the resulting fluctuations in fair value of these securities can occur independent of interest rates and may relate to other factors impacting the mortgage and fixed income markets such as liquidity or changes in required rates of return on different assets 
liquidity risk the primary liquidity risk for us arises from financing long term assets with shorter term borrowings through repurchase agreements 
our assets that are pledged to secure repurchase agreements are agency securities and cash 
as of december   we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of billion and unpledged agency securities of billion available to settle our net payable for agency securities  meet margin calls on our repurchase agreements and derivative contracts and for other corporate purposes 
however  should the value of our agency securities pledged as collateral or the value of our derivative instruments suddenly decrease  margin calls relating to our repurchase and derivative agreements could increase  causing an adverse change in our liquidity position 
further  there is no assurance that we will always be able to renew or roll our repurchase agreements 
in addition  our counterparties have the option to increase our haircuts margin requirements on the assets we pledge  against repurchase agreements thereby reducing the amount that can be borrowed against an asset even if they agree to renew or roll the repurchase agreement 
significantly higher haircuts can reduce our ability to leverage our portfolio or even force us to sell assets  especially if correlated with asset price declines or faster prepayment rates on our assets 
in addition  we may utilize tba dollar roll transactions as a means of investing in and financing agency mortgage backed securities 
under certain economic conditions it may be uneconomical to roll our tba dollar roll transactions prior to the settlement date and we could have to take physical delivery of the underlying securities and settle our obligations for cash  which could negatively impact our liquidity position  result in defaults or force us to sell assets under adverse conditions 
extension risk the projected weighted average life and the duration or interest rate sensitivity of our investments is based on our manager s assumptions regarding the rate at which the borrowers will prepay the underlying mortgage loans 
in general  we use interest rate swaps and swaptions to help manage our funding cost on our investments in the event that interest rates rise 
these swaps or swaptions allow us to reduce our funding exposure on the notional amount of the swap for a specified period of time by establishing a fixed rate to pay in exchange for receiving a floating rate that generally tracks our financing costs under our repurchase agreements 
however  if prepayment rates decrease in a rising interest rate environment  the average life or duration of our fixed rate assets or the fixed rate portion of the arms or other assets generally extends 
this could have a negative impact on our results from operations  as our interest rate swap maturities are fixed and will  therefore  cover a smaller percentage of our funding exposure on our mortgage assets to the extent that their average lives increase due to slower prepayments 
this situation may also cause the market value of our agency securities collateralized by fixed rate mortgages or hybrid arms to decline by more than otherwise would be the case while most of our hedging instruments with the exception of short tba mortgage positions  interest only securities  markit ios index total return swaps and certain other supplemental hedging instruments would not receive any incremental offsetting gains 
in extreme situations  we may be forced to sell assets to maintain adequate liquidity  which could cause us to incur realized losses 
counterparty credit risk we are exposed to counterparty credit risk relating to potential losses that could be recognized in the event that the counterparties to our repurchase agreements and derivative contracts fail to perform their obligations under such agreements 
the amount of assets we pledge as collateral in accordance with our agreements varies over time based on the market value and notional amount of such assets as well as the value of our derivative contracts 
in the event of a default by a counterparty we may not receive payments provided for under the terms of our agreements and may have difficulty obtaining our assets pledged as collateral under such agreements 
our credit risk related to certain derivative transactions is largely mitigated through a daily mark to market of collateral pledged and we limit our counterparties to major financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings 
however  there is no guarantee our efforts to manage counterparty credit risk will be successful and we could suffer significant losses if unsuccessful
