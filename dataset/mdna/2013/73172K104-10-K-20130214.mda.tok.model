in  we made strategic investments and executed on five key strategic imperatives to capture the emerging network effect of uc c adoption by enterprise  public sector  service providers  smbs  mobile and remote employees  and social business users 
these five key strategic imperatives included cloud based uc c solutions  mobile uc c solutions  focused ecosystem partnerships  polycom realpresence platform  and growth markets 
on december   we completed the sale of our enterprise wireless voice solutions ews business to a third party 
the decision to divest ews reflects our focus on initiatives that we expect to extend our leadership in our core unified communications business 
the products and services that comprise our core unified communications business have historically experienced stronger sales growth and higher gross margins than our ews products and services 
our ews product portfolio  which was part of the uc personal devices product category  included wi fi and dect handsets  related infrastructure and accessories  and generated revenues of approximately million  million and million  in   and  respectively 
we have reported the results of operations and financial position of ews as discontinued operations within the consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets for all periods presented 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our discontinued operations 
the following discussion of our results of operations is based upon the results from our continuing operations unless otherwise indicated 
revenues for were billion  a decrease of million  or  from on a year over year basis  our total product revenues declined while service revenues increased in all of our segments 
the decrease in product revenues was primarily a result of lower sales of our uc group systems products and uc platform 
table of contents products  partially offset by an increase in product revenues from uc personal devices products 
the increase in service revenues was driven primarily by increased maintenance revenues on a larger installed base  as well as an increase in managed service revenues as a result of our acquisition of the hewlett packard visual collaboration hpvc business in the third quarter of revenues decreased across all of our segments in as compared to our americas  emea  and apac segment revenues  which accounted for   and  respectively  of our revenues in  all decreased by  as compared to our americas segment revenues were negatively impacted  in part  by lower us federal and public sector revenues 
the decline in emea segment revenues was driven by a difficult macroeconomic environment 
the decline in our apac segment revenues was due primarily to reduced government spending and elongated sales cycles  particularly in china 
over the past several quarters  we have seen increased conservatism from our china end users and partners due to the current government transition 
we believe this conservatism will persist through the first quarter of see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our segments  including a summary of our segment revenues  segment contribution margin and segment accounts receivable 
the discussion of results of operations at the consolidated level is also followed by a discussion of results of operations by segment for the three years ended december  during  we experienced a slight decline in total revenues compared to revenue growth of in and in we believe the revenue decline was due to several factors  including a company and industry transition from point products to solution selling which resulted in some customers requiring additional time to consider a more uc c centric strategy versus point product or end point only deployments  lower revenues in our emea segment impacted by the recent economic conditions in europe  and lower spending in other key geographies such as china  india  australia and the united states 
operating margins decreased by percentage points in as compared to these decreases are primarily due to operating expenses increasing in absolute dollars by year over year while revenues were down year over year 
operating expenses increased as a percentage of revenues to in from in the increases in operating expenses in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues were primarily due to increased headcount related costs  including stock based compensation  increased restructuring costs  including the consolidation of certain facilities  and increased sales and marketing expenses as a result of our recent rebranding and product launches  as well as increased telemarketing expenses 
these increases were in continuing support of our key strategic initiatives and in anticipation of revenue growth 
gross margins were two percentage points lower in as compared to  which also contributed to the lower operating margins 
lower gross margins were primarily due to lower overall revenue levels and change in product mix in as compared to during  we generated approximately million in cash flow from operating activities which  after the impact of cash received from sale of our wireless business  cash paid for share repurchases  and other financing and investing activities described in further detail under liquidity and capital resources  resulted in a million net increase in our total cash and cash equivalents

the increases in service revenues were primarily due to increased maintenance revenues on larger installed base and increased managed service revenues as a result of the hpvc business acquisition that we completed in the third quarter of from a segment perspective  total revenues decreased across all segments in as compared to our americas  emea  and apac segment revenues decreased by million  million  and million  respectively  in as compared to  a sequential decline of year over year in each segment 
the decreases were driven by decreased revenues across many of our key geographic markets  including the united states  australia  brazil  the nordics  the middle east africa and turkey  india  japan  and china 
overall  product revenues decreased and service revenues increased across all segments in as compared to total revenues for were billion  an increase of million  or  over  driven by increases in both product and services revenues 
product revenues increased by million  or  and service revenues increased by million  or  in as compared with the increase in revenues in from was across all segments  most predominantly in the apac segment  primarily as a result of investments made in our go to market capabilities which resulted in increased sales volumes while average selling prices remained relatively stable and  to a lesser extent  driven by revenues from the hpvc acquisition in the third quarter of our americas  emea  and apac segment revenues increased by million  or  million  or  and million  or  respectively  in as compared to these increases were driven by increased revenues across many of our key geographic markets  including the united states  china  australia  brazil  russia  the united kingdom  india  germany  and the nordics 
in   and  one channel partner  scansource communications  in our americas segment accounted for of our total revenues 
we believe it is unlikely that the loss of any of our channel partners would have a long term material adverse effect on our consolidated revenues or segment revenues as we believe end users would likely purchase our products from a different channel partner 
however  a loss of any one of these channel partners could have a material adverse impact during the transition period 
in addition to the primary view on a geographic basis  we also track revenues by groups of similar products and services for various purposes 
the following table presents revenues for groups of similar products and services year ended december  increase decrease from prior year in thousands uc group systems uc personal devices uc platform total revenues uc group systems include all immersive telepresence  group video and group voice systems products and the related service elements 
the decrease in uc group systems of million  or  in from was primarily driven by decreases in sales of our group video systems products and related services in all our geographic segments and  to a lesser extent  by decreases in sales of our group voice systems products and related services in our americas and emea segments 
those decreases were partially offset by increases in sales 
table of contents of our immersive telepresence products and related services across all segments  and  to a lesser extent  an increase in sales of group voice systems products and related services in our apac segment 
the increase in uc group systems of million  or  in from was primarily driven by increases in sales of our group video and our immersive telepresence products and related services and  to a lesser extent  increases in revenues from our group voice products and related services 
uc personal devices include desktop video devices and desktop voice products and the related service elements 
the increase in uc personal devices of million  or  in from was primarily due to increased sales of our desktop voice products and related services in our americas and emea segments  partially offset by decreased revenues from desktop video products and related services in all our geographic segments and  to a lesser extent decreased revenues from desktop voice products and related services in apac 
the increase in uc personal devices of million  or  in over was primarily due to increased sales of our desktop voice products and related services in all our geographic segments  driven by the continued adoption of voip 
uc platform includes our realpresence platform hardware and software products and the related service elements 
uc platform revenues remained relatively flat in as compared to  primarily due to increases in revenues from our americas and apac segments being largely offset by decreases in revenues from our emea segment

inventory turns in the future may fluctuate depending on our ability to reduce lead times  changes in product mix  the flexibility required to respond to the increased demands of our growing business  and the sustainability of the global economic recovery 
cost of service revenues and service gross margins cost of service revenues consists primarily of material and direct labor  including stock based compensation costs  depreciation  and an allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs 
the majority of our service revenues are related to maintenance agreements on new product sales  and the renewal of existing maintenance agreements  as well as managed services offerings 
cost of service revenues and service gross margins included charges for stock based compensation of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
overall  service gross margins decreased by percentage points in from the decrease was primarily due to the lower margin managed services business we acquired as part of the hpvc acquisition in direct spending costs increased primarily as a result of increased headcount related costs  including stock based compensation costs  as well as it and facilities allocations as a result of a increase in services organization headcount from december  to december  service gross margins decreased in our emea and apac segments  but were up in the americas segment in as compared to overall  service gross margins increased by percentage points in over services gross margins increased in all of our geographic segments primarily as a result of increased revenues from our maintenance services and decreased costs as a percentage of revenue associated with the delivery of services due to higher productivity of services employees  improvements in product quality and lower outside services 
total cost of revenues and total gross margins overall  total gross margins as a percentage of revenues decreased by percentage points in as compared to  due to decreases in both product and service gross margins  as discussed under cost of product revenues and product gross margins and cost of services revenues and service gross margins 
total gross margins as a percentage of revenues remained flat in as compared to we expect gross margins to remain relatively flat in the near term as compared to forecasting future gross margin percentages is difficult  and there are a number of risks related to our ability to maintain or improve our current gross margin levels 
our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue can vary significantly based upon a number of factors such as the following uncertainties surrounding revenue levels  including future pricing and or potential discounts as a result of the economy or in response to the strengthening of the us dollar in our international markets  and related production level variances  competition  the extent to which new services sales accompany our product sales  as well as maintenance renewal rates  changes in technology  changes in product mix  variability of stock based compensation costs  the potential of royalties to third parties  utilization of our professional services personnel as we develop our professional services practice and as we make investments to expand our professional services offerings  increasing costs for freight and repair costs  our

in addition  we may experience higher prices on commodity components that are included in our products 
in order to control expenses in any given quarter  we have taken actions to reduce costs such as imposing travel restrictions  postponing salary increases  requesting employees to use paid time off or implementing other cost control measures 
such actions may not be able to be implemented in a timely manner or may not be successful in completely offsetting the impact of lower than anticipated revenues

sales and marketing expenses increased by percentage points as a percentage of revenue and increased by in absolute dollars in as compared to  due primarily to increased compensation related costs  including commissions and stock based compensation costs 
other factors contributing to the increase include consulting and outside services related to our recent rebranding and product launches  as well as increased telemarketing expenses 
facilities and it allocations also increased 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in training expenses 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased by percentage points but increased in absolute dollars by in as compared to  due primarily to increased headcount and compensation related costs  including commissions 
sales and marketing headcount increased by from december  to december  depreciation and facilities allocations also increased as a result of headcount increases  as well as due to the expansion of our demonstration center capabilities in support of our go to market strategy 
we expect our sales and marketing expenses to remain relatively flat in absolute dollars in the near term 
expenses will fluctuate depending on revenue levels achieved  as certain expenses  such as commissions  are determined based on revenues achieved 
forecasting sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue is highly dependent on expected revenue levels and could vary significantly depending on actual revenues achieved in any given quarter 
marketing expenses will also fluctuate depending upon the timing and extent of marketing programs as we market new products 
sales and marketing expenses may also fluctuate due to increased international expenses and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to control expenses in any given quarter  we have taken actions to reduce costs such as imposing travel restrictions  postponing salary increases  requesting employees to use paid time off or implementing other cost control measures 
such actions may not be able to be implemented in a timely manner or may not be successful in completely offsetting the impact of lower than anticipated revenues

research and development expenses increased by million  or  in as compared to  and increased by percentage points  as a percentage of revenues  in as compared to the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increased compensation costs associated with increased headcount and increased development expenses in support of our key strategic initiatives  including our strategic partnerships as part of our uc c ecosystem  cloud based and mobile uc c solutions and realpresence platform hardware and software products 
research and development headcount increased by from december  to december  depreciation and overhead allocations also increased in over as a result of headcount increases and increased capital investments in support of our development projects 
we believe that innovation and technological leadership is critical to our future success  and we are committed to continuing a significant level of research and development to develop new technologies and products to combat competitive pressures  such as the new scalable video coding standard to address the device  application and network requirements of mobile  smb and consumer networks  and other technologies incorporated into our next generation products 
we are also investing more heavily in research and development as a result of increased business opportunities with strategic partners  and mobile and service provider customers as a result of our strategic initiatives in these areas 
we expect that research and development expenses in absolute dollars will remain relatively flat in the near term but will fluctuate depending on the timing and number of development activities in any given quarter 
research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue is highly dependent on expected revenue levels and could vary significantly depending on actual revenues achieved in any given quarter 
in order to control expenses in any given quarter  we have from time to time taken actions to reduce costs such as imposing travel restrictions  postponing salary increases  requesting employees to use paid time off or implementing other cost control measures

general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  in as compared to  and increased by percentage point as a percentage of revenues in as compared to the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increased compensation related costs including stock based compensation 
general and administrative headcount increased by from december  to december  the remaining increases in general and administrative expenses were attributed to increases in legal and bad debt expenses and allocation expenses as a result of increased headcount and our new headquarters building in san jose  california 
general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars by million  or  but decreased by percentage point as a percentage of revenue in as compared to the primary driver of the increase in absolute dollars was related to the increase in headcount and related increases in compensation and other headcount related expenses  including increased overhead allocations 
this increase was partially offset by decreased expenses for legal and outside services 
further  in  we incurred severance  legal and other costs associated with our ceo transition in may significant future charges due to costs associated with litigation or uncollectability of our receivables could increase our general and administrative expenses and negatively affect our profitability in the quarter in which they are recorded 
additionally  predicting the timing of litigation and bad debt expense associated with uncollectible receivables is difficult 
the increase in international revenues has resulted in longer credit terms and increased credit risk  which could result in an increased level of bad debt expense in the future 
future general and administrative expense increases or decreases in absolute dollars are difficult to predict due to the lack of visibility of certain costs  including legal costs associated with defending claims against us  as well as legal costs associated with asserting and enforcing our intellectual property portfolio and other factors 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will remain relatively flat in absolute dollar amounts in the near term  but could fluctuate depending on the level and timing of additional investments required to support strategic initiatives 
in order to control expenses in any given quarter  we have taken actions to reduce costs such as imposing travel restrictions  postponing salary increases  requesting employees to use paid time off or implementing other cost control measures 
such actions may not be able to be implemented in a timely manner or may not be successful in completely offsetting the impact of lower than anticipated revenues 
acquisition related costs we expense all acquisition and other transaction related costs as incurred 
these costs generally include fees for outside legal and accounting services and other integration services

we have spent and will continue to spend significant resources identifying and acquiring businesses 
during  we recorded million of acquisition related costs  primarily associated with planning and executing the divestiture of our enterprise wireless solutions business 
see note of note to consolidated financial statements for further information 
during  we recorded million of acquisition related costs 
these costs were primarily related to our acquisition of accordent which closed in march  our acquisition of hpvc which closed in july  and our acquisition of vivu which closed in october no such activities occurred in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

table of contents amortization of purchased intangibles in   and  we recorded million  million  and million  respectively  in operating expenses for amortization of purchased intangibles acquired in our acquisitions 
in addition to the amounts recorded as operating expenses in  and  we recorded amortization expenses totaling million  million  and million  respectively  related to certain technology intangibles in cost of product revenues 
the sequential increases year over year from to were primarily due to the amortization of purchased intangibles acquired from accordent in the first quarter of  from hpvc in the third quarter of  and from vivu in the fourth quarter of purchased intangible assets are being amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives  which range from several months to six years 
we evaluate our purchased intangibles for possible impairment on an ongoing basis 
when impairment indicators exist  we perform an assessment to determine if the intangible asset has been impaired and to what extent 
the assessment of purchased intangibles impairment is conducted by first estimating the undiscounted future cash flows to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of the purchased intangibles and comparing this amount with the carrying value of these assets 
if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amounts  impairment exists  and future cash flows are discounted at an appropriate rate and compared to the carrying amounts of the purchased intangibles to determine the amount of the impairment 
no impairment charges were recognized for all periods presented 
restructuring costs in   and  we recorded million  million  and million  respectively  related to restructuring actions which resulted from the consolidation of certain facilities and the elimination or relocation of various positions as part of restructuring plans approved by management 
these actions are generally intended to streamline and focus our efforts and more properly align our cost structure with our projected revenue streams 
in  we completed the consolidation and elimination of certain facilities in order to gain efficiencies  including the combination of our headquarters in san jose and santa clara  california into one new location in san jose  california 
as a result  we recorded approximately million net of million of deferred rent in restructuring charges related to idle facilities upon vacating these facilities in the second quarter of in addition  we recorded approximately million of charges  primarily for severance and other employee benefits  related to restructuring actions approved by management in october and july the action plan approved in july resulted in the elimination of approximately four percent of our global workforce  enabling us to focus resources on our product development and product launch initiatives 
in  we completed the consolidation of our colorado facilities and began the transition of certain engineering and product management and related support functions in our andover  massachusetts facility to other locations in order to achieve efficiencies 
restructuring charges relating to these actions primarily included costs for idle facilities and  to a lesser extent  severance and relocation costs for impacted individuals 
additionally  in october  we committed to a restructuring plan designed to better align and allocate resources to more strategic growth areas of the business 
these actions were primarily related to the reorganization of our global go to market and other organizations 
the restructuring plan resulted in the elimination of approximately seven percent of our global workforce with the majority of the reductions taking effect in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  enabling the creation of new positions that better aligned with our strategic initiatives 
in  we recorded approximately million of restructuring charges related to severance and other employee benefits and million related to idle facilities 
in  we committed to several restructuring plans to eliminate  relocate positions  or to enable the hiring of additional positions to better align with the execution of our strategic initiatives 
the restructuring plans included the elimination of approximately two percent of our global workforce 
as a result of the actions taken in  we recorded restructuring charges of million during  primarily related to severance and other employee termination benefits 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on restructuring costs 

table of contents we currently expect to record additional restructuring charges of between million and million in  primarily related to the elimination or consolidation of certain facilities to gain efficiencies 
in the first quarter of  we also currently expect to record restructuring charges between approximately million and million related to severance and other employee termination benefits  primarily related to the elimination or relocation of engineering positions as a result of downsizing our burnaby  canada location 
in the future  we may take additional restructuring actions to gain operating efficiencies or reduce our operating expenses  while simultaneously implementing additional cost containment measures and expense control programs 
such restructuring actions are subject to significant risks  including delays in implementing expense control programs or workforce reductions and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees or a decrease in employee morale  all of which would impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions 
if we do not achieve the anticipated cost reductions  our business could be harmed 
litigation reserves and payments we recorded million in in litigation reserves and payments in the consolidated statements of operations related to the settlement of legal matters during the period 
there were no such expenses in and see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
we are also subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business 
these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management s view of these matters may change in the future and could result in charges that would have a material adverse impact on our financial position  our results of operations  or our cash flows 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net  consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and investments less bank charges resulting from the use of our bank accounts  gains and losses on investments  non income related taxes and fees as well as foreign exchange related gains and losses 
interest and other income expense  net  was a net expense of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the increase in net expenses in interest and other income expense  net  in from was primarily due to higher non income related taxes and bank charges as well as higher foreign exchange related losses in as compared to  partially offset by an increase in interest income 
the decrease in net expenses in interest and other income expense  net  in from was primarily due to a write down in of other than temporarily impaired investments that did not recur in  partially offset by a decrease in interest income 
interest and other income expense  net  will fluctuate due to changes in interest rates and returns on our cash and investments  any future impairment of investments  foreign currency rate fluctuations on un hedged exposures  fluctuations in costs associated with our hedging program and timing of non income related taxes and license fees 
the cash balance could also decrease depending upon the amount of cash used in any future acquisitions  our stock repurchase activity and other factors  which would also impact our interest income 
provision for income taxes from continuing operations year ended december  income tax expense from continuing operations effective tax rate 
table of contents the increase in the effective tax rate in as compared to was related primarily to million in federal and state taxes recorded on million related to the tax consequences of a global restructuring project affecting the existing legal entity structure that is designed to accommodate the trend towards more software and virtual based solutions versus our traditional hardware distribution model 
in addition to taxes recorded related to the global restructuring  the effective tax rate was also impacted by the benefit of entities in countries with tax rates lower than the us statutory rate  an increase in non deductible share based compensation  an increase in non deductible acquisition and divestiture related expenses  a decrease in reserve reversals and the expiration of the federal research and development tax credit in as compared to the decrease in the effective tax rate in as compared to was due to a relative increase in foreign earnings which are subject to lower tax rates  an increase in us research and development tax credits  and an increase in the release of uncertain tax positions inclusive of related interest and penalties of million in as compared to million in  partially offset by us taxes accrued on the intercompany sale of intellectual properties

the reserve releases would be recorded as adjustments to tax expense in the period released 
we recognize interest and or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
as of december  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions 

table of contents our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors  such as changes in tax legislation  accounting principles  or interpretations thereof  the geographic composition of our pre tax income  non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions  amounts of tax exempt interest income and research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre tax income  final resolution of the tax impact from the exercise of incentive stock options and the issuance of shares under the employee stock purchase plan  and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 
for example  on january   the american taxpayer relief act of was signed into law 
it provides for an extension of the federal research credit retroactive for and extended through the impact of the federal research credit will be reflected in the first quarter of and is estimated to be in the range of million to million 
we believe that our future effective tax rate may be more volatile as a result of these factors 
we are also subject to the periodic examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our net income and financial condition  possibly materially 
segment information our business is organized around four major geographic theatres north america  central america latin america cala  europe  middle east and africa emea and asia pacific apac 
for reporting purposes  we aggregate north america and cala into one segment named americas and report emea and apac as separate segments 
the segments are determined in accordance with how management views and evaluates its business and allocates its resources  and based on the criteria as outlined in the authoritative guidance 
a description of our products and services  as well as annual financial data  for each segment can be found in the business section of this form k and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the discussions below include the results of each of our segments for the years ended december    and segment contribution margin includes all segment revenues less the related cost of sales and direct marketing and sales expenses 
management allocates some infrastructure costs such as facilities and it costs in determining segment contribution margin 
contribution margin is used  in part  to evaluate the performance of  and to allocate resources to  each of the segments 
certain operating expenses are not allocated to segments because they are separately managed at the corporate level 
these unallocated costs include corporate manufacturing costs  sales and marketing costs other than direct sales and marketing  stock based compensation costs  research and development costs  general and administrative costs  such as legal and accounting costs  acquisition related integration costs  amortization of purchased intangible assets  restructuring costs  and interest and other income expense  net

discontinued operations on may   we entered into a purchase and sale agreement the purchase agreement with mobile devices holdings  llc  a delaware limited liability corporation mobile devices  pursuant to which we would divest ews to an affiliate of sun capital partners  inc on october   the purchase agreement was amended the amended purchase agreement 
per the terms of the amended purchase agreement  mobile devices would acquire spectralink corporation spectralink  a wholly owned subsidiary of polycom  by purchasing all of the outstanding stock and an intercompany note of spectralink from polycom 
on december   we completed the disposition of the assets of our ews business to mobile devices and received cash consideration of approximately million  resulting in a gain on sale of the discontinued operations  net of taxes  of million 
the decision to divest ews reflects our focus on initiatives that extend our leadership in our core unified communications business 
the products and services that comprise our core unified communications business have historically experienced stronger sales growth and higher gross margins than our ews products and services 
our ews product portfolio  which was previously included in our uc personal devices product category  includes wi fi and dect handsets and related infrastructure and accessories  which were primarily sold in our americas and emea segments 
as a result  we have reported the results of operations and financial position of ews as discontinued operations within the consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets for all periods presented 
see note of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our discontinued operations 
summarized results from discontinued operations were as follows in thousands year ended december  revenues income from discontinued operations income tax provision net income from discontinued operations revenues from discontinued operations for were million  a decrease of million  or  from the decrease was primarily due to the revenues including only a period of months through the closure of the ews sale transaction as compared to the month period for revenues from discontinued operations for were million  a decrease of million  or  from the decrease in wireless revenues was the result of decreasing demand for wireless related products and services 
wireless revenues were down in as compared to and in as compared to in the americas and emea segments 
wireless revenues in our apac segment were not significant 
net income from discontinued operations was essentially flat in as compared to  and increased by million in as compared to the increase in from was primarily due to improvements in gross margin and a decrease in operating expenses in from the improvement in wireless gross margins was due to a lower mix of sales of lower margin products 
operating expenses of discontinued 
table of contents operations decreased by million in  compared to the prior year  as we continued to reduce spending in our wireless business as a result of a smaller revenue base in our wireless products 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million and long term investments of million 
substantially all of our short term and long term investments are comprised of us government and agency securities and corporate debt securities 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our short term and long term investments 
we also have outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately million  which are in place to satisfy certain of our facility lease requirements as well as other legal  tax  and insurance obligations 
our total cash and cash equivalents and investments held in the united states totaled million as of december   and the remaining million was held by various foreign subsidiaries outside of the united states 
if we would need to access our cash and cash equivalents and investments held outside of the united states in order to fund acquisitions  share repurchases or our working capital needs  we may be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes 
we generated cash from operating activities totaling million in  million in  and million in the decrease in cash provided from operating activities in from was due primarily to lower net income  as adjusted for non cash income and expenses  increased inventory  a decrease in accounts payable  and a smaller increase in other accrued liabilities and deferred revenue 
partially offsetting these negative effects were decreases in accounts receivables 
the increase in cash provided from operating activities in over was due primarily to higher net income  as adjusted for non cash income and expenses  decreased inventory  a smaller increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets  and a higher increase in accounts payable  other accrued liabilities and deferred revenue  and taxes payable 
partially offsetting these positive effects were increases in accounts receivables  and deferred taxes 
the total net change in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended december  was an increase of million 
the primary sources of cash were million from operating activities  million of net cash proceeds from the sale of our ews business  million associated with the exercise of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan and million in excess tax benefits from stock based compensation 
the primary uses of cash during this period were million for purchases of property and equipment  million for purchases of our common stock  million for purchases of investments  net of proceeds from investments  and million of additional payments made for acquisitions of certain additional equipment 
our days sales outstanding  or dso  metric was days at december  compared to days at december  we expect to continue to experience upward pressure on our dso as a result of the increase in international receivables  which typically have longer payment terms 
dso could vary as a result of a number of factors such as fluctuations in revenue linearity  a change in the mix of international receivables  and increases in receivables from service providers and government entities which also have customarily longer payment terms 
dso could also be negatively impacted if our partners experience difficulty in financing purchases  which results in delays in payment to us 
our december  finished goods inventory levels were higher than the december  levels and inventory turns decreased to turns at december  from turns at december  the decreased inventory turns were as a result of higher inventory levels in as compared to primarily due to an 
table of contents increase in uc group product inventories related to our new product introductions 
inventory turns in the future may fluctuate depending on our ability to reduce lead times  as well as changes in product mix 
our inventory turns may also decrease in the future as a result of the flexibility required to respond to the increased demands of our growing business and the sustainability of the global economic recovery 
cash used for purchases of property and equipment decreased slightly to million in from million in we expect our purchases of property and equipment in to increase due to upgrades to our enterprise resource planning erp systems and continued support of our strategic alliances and new product offerings 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts  which typically mature in one month  to hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations of foreign currency denominated receivables  payables  and cash balances 
we record on the balance sheet at each reporting period the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and record any fair value adjustments in results of operations 
gains and losses associated with currency rate changes on contracts are recorded in interest and other income expense  net  offsetting transaction gains and losses on the related assets and liabilities 
additionally  our hedging costs can vary depending on the size of our hedging program  on whether we are purchasing or selling foreign currency relative to the us dollar and on interest rate spreads between the us and other foreign markets 
additionally  we also have a hedging program that uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of anticipated revenues and operating expenses denominated in the euro and british pound as well as operating expenses denominated in israeli shekels 
at each reporting period  we record the fair value of our unrealized forward contracts on the balance sheet with related unrealized gains and losses as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a separate element of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses associated with the effective portion of the foreign currency forward contracts are recorded within revenue or operating expense  depending upon the underlying exposure being hedged 
any excluded and ineffective portions of a hedging instrument would be recorded in interest and other income expense  net 
from time to time  the board of directors has approved plans for us to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market 
during the years ended december    and  we purchased approximately million  million  and million shares  as adjusted for the stock split  respectively  of our common stock in the open market for cash of million  million  and million  respectively 
our board of directors approved an increase in the current share repurchase authorization to include the million net proceeds from the sale of our ews business 
as of december   we were authorized to purchase up to an additional million under the share repurchase plan 
see note of notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the accounting for our common stock repurchases and the related reduction to retained earnings included in stockholders equity in our consolidated balance sheet 
at december   we had open purchase orders related to our contract manufacturers and other contractual obligations of approximately million primarily related to inventory purchases 
we also currently have commitments that consist of obligations under our operating leases 
in the event that we decide to cease using a facility and seek to sublease such facility or terminate a lease obligation through a lease buyout or other means  we may incur a material cash outflow at the time of such transaction  which will negatively impact our operating results and overall cash flows 
in addition  if facilities rental rates decrease or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities  we could incur a significant further charge to operations and our operating and overall cash flows could be negatively impacted in the period that these changes or events occur 

table of contents these purchase commitments and lease obligations are reflected in our consolidated financial statements once goods or services have been received or at such time when we are obligated to make payments related to these goods  services or leases 
in addition  our bank has issued letters of credit totaling approximately million  which are used to secure the leases on some of our offices as well as other legal  tax  and insurance obligations 
the table set forth below shows  as of december   the future minimum lease payments due under our current lease obligations 
there is no sublease income netted in the amounts below  as the amounts are not material 
in addition to these minimum lease payments  we are contractually obligated under the majority of our operating leases to pay certain operating expenses during the term of the lease such as maintenance  taxes and insurance 
our contractual obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands minimum lease payments projected annual operating costs other long term liabilities purchase commitments year ending december  thereafter total payments as of december   we have million of unrecognized tax benefits compared to million at december  by the end of  uncertain tax positions may be reduced as a result of a lapse in the applicable statutes of limitations 
we anticipate that the reduction would approximate million 
the reserve releases would be recorded as adjustments to tax expense in the period released 
we believe that our available cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may require or desire additional funds to support our operating expenses and capital requirements or for other purposes  such as acquisitions  and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financing  debt financing or from other sources 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available at all or that  if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to us and would not be dilutive 
our future liquidity and cash requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the introduction of new products and potential acquisitions of related businesses or technology 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our process used to develop estimates  including those related to product returns  accounts receivable  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  stock compensation costs  restructuring  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other 
table of contents sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
these estimates and judgments are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis and by the audit committee at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition and product returns we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss have transferred  product payment is not contingent upon performance of installation or service obligations  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
in instances where final acceptance of the product or service is specified by the customer  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
we generally recognize service revenues ratably over the service periods of one to five years or upon the completion of installation or professional services 
some of our products are integrated with software that is essential to the functionality of the equipment 
additionally  we provide unspecified software upgrades and enhancements related to most of these products through maintenance contracts 
when a sale involves multiple deliverables  such as sales of products that include services  the multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine the unit of accounting  and the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of each deliverable 
when applying the relative selling price method  we determine the selling price for each deliverable using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price  if it exists  or third party evidence tpe of selling price 
if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exist for a deliverable  we use our best estimate of selling price for that deliverable 
revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the other revenue recognition criteria are met for each element 
channel partner programs and incentives we record estimated reductions to revenues for channel partner programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
if market conditions were to decline or competition were to increase further  we may take future actions to increase channel partner incentive offerings  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenues at the time the incentive is offered 
we accrue for co op marketing funds as a marketing expense if we receive an identifiable benefit in exchange and can reasonably estimate the fair value of the identifiable benefit received  otherwise  it is recorded as a reduction to revenues 
warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
our warranty obligation is affected by estimated product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revision of the estimated warranty liability would be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly by assessing individual accounts receivable over a specific aging and amount  and all other balances on a pooled basis based on historical collection experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  adversely 
table of contents affecting their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
delinquent account balances are written off after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is not probable 
excess and obsolete inventory we record write downs for excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated fair value based upon assumptions about future product life cycles  product demand and market conditions 
if actual product life cycles  product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration of or increase in that newly established cost basis 
stock based compensation expense our stock based compensation programs consist of grants of share based awards to employees and non employee directors  including stock options  restricted stock units and performance shares  as well as our employee stock purchase plan 
we measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
the estimated fair value of these awards  including the effect of estimated forfeitures  is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
the fair values of stock option awards and shares purchased under the employee stock purchase plan are estimated at the grant date using the black scholes option valuation model 
the fair value of restricted stock units is based on the market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of performance shares is based on the market price of our stock on the date of grant and assumes that the performance criteria will be met and the target payout level will be achieved 
compensation cost is adjusted for subsequent changes in the probable outcome of performance related conditions until the award vests 
the fair value of a performance share with a market condition is estimated on the date of award  using a monte carlo simulation model to estimate the total return ranking of our stock among the russell index companies for awards granted prior to and nasdaq composite index companies for awards granted in and over each performance period 
changes in the underlying factors and assumptions utilized may result in significant variability in the stock based compensation costs we record  which makes such amounts difficult to accurately predict 
deferred and refundable taxes we estimate our actual current tax expense together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance against these tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance in a period  we must include and expense the allowance within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
as of december   we have million in net deferred tax assets 
included in the net deferred tax asset balance is a million valuation allowance related primarily to research credits in a jurisdiction with a history of credits in excess of taxable profits 
we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two step approach 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit  the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon settlement 
significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions 
we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
our evaluations are based upon a number of factors  
table of contents including changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues 
changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change  which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results 
fair value fair value is an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
as such  fair value is a market based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
as the basis for considering such assumptions  a three tier value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets  level inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly  and level unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data  which require us to develop our own assumptions 
this hierarchy requires us to use observable market data  when available  and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value 
on a recurring basis  we measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value  including our marketable securities and foreign currency contracts 
our cash and investment instruments are classified within level or level of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using inputs such as quoted market prices  broker or dealer quotations  or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency 
the types of instruments valued based on quoted market prices in active markets include money market funds 
such instruments are generally classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
the types of instruments valued based on other observable inputs include us treasury securities and other government agencies  corporate bonds and commercial paper 
such instruments are generally classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
as of december   our fixed income available for sale securities include us treasury obligations and other government agency instruments  corporate bonds  commercial paper  non us government securities and money market funds 
included in available for sale securities are cash equivalents  which consist of investments with original maturities of three months or less and include money market funds 
the principal market where we execute our foreign currency contracts is the retail market in an over the counter environment with a relatively high level of price transparency 
the market participants and our counterparties are large money center banks and regional banks 
our foreign currency contracts valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and quoted pricing intervals from public data sources specifically  spot exchange rates  libor rates and credit default rates and do not involve management judgment 
these contracts are typically classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
for more information on the fair values of our marketable securities and foreign currency contracts see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
business combinations we recognize separately from goodwill the fair value of assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
while we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date  our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement 
as a result  during the measurement period  which may be up to one year from the acquisition date  we may record adjustments retrospectively to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  with the corresponding offset to goodwill 
upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed  whichever comes first  any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents in addition  uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date 
we reevaluate these items quarterly and record any adjustments to our preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period and we continue to collect information in order to determine their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition 
subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance s estimated value  changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations 
goodwill and purchased intangibles goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is one level below or the same as an operating segment 
we adopted the amended accounting guidance  which permits us to choose to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if based on this assessment we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
our business is organized around four major geographic theatres north america  central america latin america cala  europe  middle east and africa emea and asia pacific apac which were determined to be our reporting units in and for reporting purposes  we aggregate north america and cala into one segment named americas and report emea and apac as separate segments 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed this qualitative assessment for our four reporting units 
each reporting unit had an estimated fair value in excess of its carrying value by more than  based on the valuation of our reporting segments performed in may in connection with the announcement of the divestiture of our ews business 
for each reporting unit  we weighed the relative impact of factors that are specific to the reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors 
the reporting unit specific factors that were considered included the results of the most recent impairment tests  as well as financial performance and changes to the reporting units carrying amounts since the most recent impairment tests 
for the industry in which the reporting units operate  we considered growth projections from independent sources and significant developments or transactions within the industry during  where applicable 
we concluded that each of the reporting unit specific and industry factors had either a positive or neutral impact on the fair value of each of the reporting units 
we also determined that macroeconomic factors during did not have a significant impact on the discount rates and growth rates used for the valuation performed 
based on the qualitative assessment  we concluded that for the four reporting units  performing the two step impairment test was unnecessary and that no impairment charge was required 
purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets  which range from several months to six years 
we annually assess whether any impairment indicators exist on purchased intangibles with finite lives 
long lived assets  including intangible assets with finite lives  are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
the assessment of purchased intangibles impairment is conducted by first estimating the undiscounted expected future cash flows to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of the purchased intangibles and comparing this amount with the carrying value of these assets 
if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amounts  impairment exists  and future cash flows are discounted at an appropriate rate and compared to the carrying amounts of the purchased intangibles to determine the amount of the impairment 
there was no impairment charge recorded in or as no impairment indicators existed 
screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred  including market conditions  operating fundamentals  competition and general economic conditions  requires 
table of contents significant judgment 
additionally  changes in the high technology industry occur frequently and quickly 
therefore  there can be no assurance that a charge to operations will not occur as a result of future goodwill and purchased intangible impairment tests 
private company investments we periodically make strategic investments in companies whose stock is not currently traded on any stock exchange and for which no quoted price exists 
the cost method of accounting is used to account for these investments as we hold a non material ownership percentage 
we review these investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable 
examples of events or changes in circumstances that may indicate to us that an impairment exists may be a significant decrease in the market value of the company  poor or deteriorating market conditions in the public and private equity capital markets  significant adverse changes in legal factors or within the business climate the company operates  and current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or projections and forecasts that demonstrate continuing losses associated with the company s future business plans 
impairment indicators identified during the reporting period could result in a significant write down in the carrying value of the investment if we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
at both december  and  our private company investments had a carrying value of million and are recorded in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
derivative instruments the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
for derivative instruments designated as a fair value hedge  the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributed to the risk being hedged 
for a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately 
for derivative instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in the period of change 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
we enter into derivatives only with counterparties that are among the largest us banks  ranked by assets  in order to minimize our credit risk 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued an accounting standard update that requires disclosure of the effect or potential effect of offsetting arrangements on a company s financial position as well as enhanced disclosure of the rights of setoff associated with a company s recognized assets and liabilities 
in january  the fasb issued another accounting standard update to clarify the scope of the standard update issued in december these accounting standard updates are effective for reporting periods beginning on or after january  we do not believe that there will be a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon the adoption of this guidance 
in july  the fasb issued an accounting standard update intended to simplify how an entity tests indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment by providing entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary 
this accounting standard update will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal we do not believe that there will be a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon the adoption of this guidance 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we generally invest excess cash in marketable debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate debt securities  and by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the estimated fair value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates the principal amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets based on the short maturities of these financial instruments 
short term and long term investments consist of us treasury obligations and other government agency instruments  corporate bonds  commercial paper  non us government securities  and money market funds 
the valuation of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
if current market conditions deteriorate  we may realize losses on the sale of our investments or we may incur temporary impairment charges requiring us to record unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
we could also incur additional other than temporary impairment charges resulting in realized losses in our consolidated statements of operations which would reduce net income 
we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge  including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the security or issuer  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow any anticipated recovery in the market value 
further  if we sell our investments prior to their maturity  we may incur a charge to operations in the period the sale takes place 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of december  the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of various magnitudes 
we model the effect of an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve 
this methodology assumes a more immediate change in interest rates to reflect the current economic environment 
the following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our securities  excluding cash and cash equivalents  held at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps and bps in thousands bps bps bps fair value bps bps bps foreign currency exchange rate risk while the majority of our sales are denominated in united states dollars  we also sell our products and services in certain european regions in euros and in british pounds  and we incur expenses in euros  british pounds  israeli shekels  and other foreign currencies  which exposes us to risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
while we do not hedge for speculative purposes  as a result of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge our foreign currency exposure to the euro  british pound  israeli shekel  japanese yen  brazilian real  and mexican peso relative to the united states dollar 
we mitigate bank counterparty risk related to our foreign currency hedging program through our policy that requires us to only enter into hedge contracts with banks that are among the world s largest banks  as ranked by total assets in us dollars 
as of december   we had net outstanding forward exchange contracts to sell million euros at  million british pounds at  million israeli shekels at  million mexican pesos at  million japanese yen at  and million brazilian real at 
these forward exchange contracts hedge our net position of foreign currency denominated receivables  payables and cash balances and typically 
table of contents mature in days or less 
as of december   we also had net outstanding forward exchange contracts to sell million euros at  and million british pounds at  and to buy million israeli shekels at 
these forward exchange contracts  carried at fair value  typically have maturities of more than days 
we also have a cash flow hedging program under which we hedge a portion of anticipated revenues and operating expenses denominated in the euro  british pound  and israeli shekels 
as of december   we had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts that have maturities of less than days 
as of december   we had outstanding foreign exchange contracts to sell million euros at  and to buy million british pounds at  and million israeli shekels at 
these forward exchange contracts  carried at fair value  typically have maturities of more than days 
based on our overall currency rate exposure as of december   a near term appreciation or depreciation in the united states dollar  relative to our foreign local currencies  would have an immaterial impact on our results of operations 
we may also decide to expand the type of products we sell in foreign currencies or may  for specific customer situations  choose to sell in foreign currencies in our other regions  thereby further increasing our foreign exchange risk
