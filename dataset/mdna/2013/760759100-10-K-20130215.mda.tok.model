item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contained elsewhere in this form k for further information 
liability insurance and bonding the nature of our business exposes us to the risk of liabilities arising out of our operations  including possible damages to the environment 
such potential liabilities could involve  for example  claims for remediation costs  personal injury  property damage and damage to the environment in cases where we may be held responsible for the escape of harmful materials  claims of employees  customers or third parties for personal injury or property damage occurring in the course of our operations  or claims alleging negligence or other wrongdoing in the planning or performance of work 
we also could be subject to fines and civil and criminal penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory requirements 
because of the nature and scope of the possible environmental damages  liabilities imposed in environmental litigation can be significant 
our solid waste operations have third party environmental liability insurance with limits in excess of those required by permit regulations  subject to certain limitations and exclusions 
however  we cannot assure you that such environmental liability insurance would be adequate  in scope or amount  in the event of a major loss  nor can we assure you that we would continue to carry excess environmental liability insurance should market conditions in the insurance industry make such coverage costs prohibitive 
we maintain commercial general and auto liability  employment practices liability  environmental and remediation liability  directors and officers liability  workers compensation and employer liability coverage  as well as umbrella liability policies to provide excess coverage over the underlying limits contained in these primary policies 
we also carry property insurance 
although we try to operate safely and prudently and we have  subject to limitations and exclusions  substantial liability insurance  we cannot assure you that we will not be exposed to uninsured liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our insurance programs for workers compensation  commercial general and auto liability  environmental and remediation liability and employee related health care benefits are either self insured or subject to large deductible insurance policies 
claims in excess of self insurance or deductible levels are insured subject to the excess policy limits and exclusions 
accruals are based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported 
due to the variable condition of the insurance market  we have experienced  and may experience in the future  increased self insurance or deductible retention levels and increased premiums 
as we assume more risk for self insurance through higher retention levels  we may experience more variability in our self insurance reserves and expense 
in the normal course of business  we purchase performance bonds  insurance policies  letters of credit  or cash and marketable securities deposits in connection with municipal residential collection contracts  financial assurance for closure and post closure of landfills  environmental remediation  environmental permits  and business licenses and permits as a financial guarantee of our performance 
to date  we have satisfied financial responsibility requirements by making deposits in the form of cash or marketable securities or by obtaining bank letters of credit  insurance policies or surety bonds 
employees we work to create and maintain an environment that attracts  develops and retains people who assure our success with customers  differentiate us from our competitors and allow us to be an employer of choice for top talent 
as of december   we employed approximately  full time employees  approximately of whom were covered by collective bargaining agreements 
safety remains our highest priority for all of our employees and the communities we serve 
our long standing commitment to safety is unwavering 
we will continue to improve our driver safety training program and reward our people for operating in a safe and conscientious manner in all our lines of business

risk factors this form k contains certain forward looking information about us that is intended to be covered by the safe harbor for forward looking statements provided by the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements are statements that are not historical facts 
words such as guidance  expect  will  may  anticipate  plan  estimate  project  intend  should  can  likely  could  outlook and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
these statements include statements about our plans  strategies and prospects 
forward looking statements are not guarantees of performance 
these statements are based upon our management current beliefs and expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainties  including the risks set forth below in these risk factors  which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in  or implied or projected by  the forward looking information and statements 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot assure you that the expectations will prove to be correct 
according  you should not place undue reliance on the forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this form k 
except to the extent required by applicable law or regulation  we undertake no obligation to update or publish revised forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this form k or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
we have substantial indebtedness  which may limit our financial flexibility 
as of december   we had approximately billion in principal value of debt and capital leases outstanding 
this amount of indebtedness and our debt service requirements may limit our financial flexibility to access additional capital and make capital expenditures and other investments in our business  to withstand economic downturns and interest rate increases  to plan for or react to changes in our business and our industry  and to comply with the financial and other covenants of our debt instruments 
further  our ability to comply with these financial and other covenants may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events that are beyond our control 
if we do not comply with these covenants  we may be required to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures  reducing or eliminating dividends or stock repurchases  selling assets  restructuring or refinancing all or part of our existing debt  or seeking additional equity capital 
general economic conditions can directly and adversely affect our operating results 
our business is directly affected by changes in national and general economic factors and overall economic activity that are outside of our control  including consumer confidence and interest rates 
a weak economy generally results in decreases in volumes of waste generated  which adversely affects our revenues 
in addition  we have a relatively high fixed cost structure  which is difficult to adjust quickly to match declining waste volume levels 
consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may decrease overall economic activity and thereby limit the amount of services we provide 
additionally  the decline in waste volumes may result in increased competitive pricing pressure and increased customer turnover  resulting in lower revenue and increased operating costs 
recent and continuing economic conditions have negatively impacted the portion of our collection business servicing commercial and industrial accounts in general and the manufacturing and construction industries in particular 
we cannot assure you that worsening economic conditions would not have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
further  recovery in the solid waste industry historically has lagged behind recovery in the general economy 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that an improvement in general economic conditions will result in an immediate  or any  improvement in our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents the weak us economy may expose us to credit risk for amounts due from governmental agencies  large national accounts  industrial customers and others 
the weak us economy has reduced the amount of taxes collected by various governmental agencies 
we provide services to a number of these agencies  including numerous municipalities 
these governmental agencies may suffer financial difficulties resulting from a decrease in tax revenue and may ultimately be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us 
in addition  the weak economy may cause other customers  including our large national accounts or industrial clients  to suffer financial difficulties and ultimately to be unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us 
this could negatively impact our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the waste industry is highly competitive and includes competitors that may have greater financial and operational resources  flexibility to reduce prices or other competitive advantages that could make it difficult for us to compete effectively 
we principally compete with large national waste management companies  numerous municipalities  and numerous regional and local companies 
competition for collection accounts is primarily based on price and the quality of services 
competition for disposal business is primarily based on price  geographic location and quality of operations 
one of our competitors may have greater financial and operational resources than we do 
further  many counties and municipalities that operate their own waste collection and disposal facilities have the benefits of tax revenue or tax exempt financing 
our ability to obtain solid waste volume for our landfills also may be limited by the fact that some major collection operations also own or operate landfills to which they send their waste 
in markets in which we do not own or operate a landfill  our collection operations may operate at a disadvantage to fully integrated competitors 
as a result of these factors  from time to time we may have difficulty competing effectively in certain markets 
if we were to lose market share or if we were to lower prices to address competitive issues  it could negatively impact our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
price increases may not be adequate to offset the impact of increased costs and may cause us to lose volume 
we seek to secure price increases necessary to offset higher costs  to maintain or improve operating margins  and to obtain adequate returns on our substantial investments in assets such as our landfills 
from time to time  our competitors reduce their prices in an effort to expand their market share 
contractual  general economic or market specific conditions also may limit our ability to raise prices 
for example  many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the consumer price index 
particularly in a weak us economy such as the current one  our costs may increase in excess of the increase  if any  in the consumer price index 
this may continue to be the case even when the us economy recovers because a recovery in the solid waste industry historically has lagged behind a recovery in the general economy 
as a result  we may be unable to offset increases in costs  improve our operating margins and obtain adequate investment returns through price increases 
price increases also might cause us to lose volume to lower cost competitors 
increases in the cost of fuel or petrochemicals would increase our operating expenses  and we cannot assure you that we would be able to recover such cost increases from our customers 
we depend on fuel purchased in the open market to operate our collection and transfer trucks and other equipment used for collection  transfer and disposal 
fuel prices are unpredictable and fluctuate significantly based on events beyond our control  including geopolitical developments  actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and other oil and gas producers  supply and demand for oil and gas  war  terrorism and unrest in oil producing countries  adverse weather and regional production patterns 
due to contractual or market factors  we may not be able to offset such volatility through fuel recovery fees 
our fuel costs were million in  or of revenue  compared to million in  or of our revenue 
to manage our exposure to volatility in fuel prices  we have entered into multiple swap agreements whereby we receive or make payments to counter parties should the price of fuel vary from a specified amount 
during  approximately of our fuel volume purchases were hedged with swap agreements 
additionally  we are able to collect fuel recovery fees from some customers 
for  we were able to recover approximately of our fuel costs with fuel recovery fees 
at current consumption levels  a twenty cent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately million on an annual basis 
offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers 
at current participation rates  a twenty cent change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel recovery fee by approximately million 
accordingly  a substantial rise or drop in fuel costs could result in a material impact to our revenue and cost of operations 
over the last several years  regulations have been adopted mandating changes in the composition of fuels for motor vehicles 
the renewable fuel standards that epa sets annually affect the type of fuel our motor vehicle fleet uses 
pursuant to the energy independence and security act of  epa establishes annual renewable fuel volume requirements and separate volume 
table of contents requirements for four different categories of renewable fuels renewable fuel  advanced biofuel  cellulosic biofuel  and biomass based diesel 
these volume requirements set standards for the proportion of refiners or importers total fuel volume that must be renewable and must take into account the fuels impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
these regulations are one of many factors that may affect the cost of the fuel we use 
our operations also require the use of products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals 
an increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products  which would increase our operating and capital costs 
petrochemical prices  and hence our operating and capital costs  may be further affected by regulatory efforts to reduce greenhouse gases from the industries that produce such petrochemicals 
we are also susceptible to increases in indirect fuel recovery fees from our vendors 
fluctuations in prices for recycled commodities that we sell to customers may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we purchase or collect and process recyclable materials such as paper  cardboard  plastics  aluminum and other metals for sale to third parties 
our results of operations may be affected by changing prices or market requirements for recyclable materials 
the resale and purchase prices of  and market demand for  recyclable materials are volatile due to changes in economic conditions and numerous other factors beyond our control 
these fluctuations may affect our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
to manage our exposure to fluctuations in prices for recycled commodities  we have entered into multiple hedging arrangements whereby we receive or make payments to counter parties should the price of recycled commodities vary from a specified amount or range 
during  approximately of our tonnage sold was hedged with such arrangements 
at current volumes and mix of materials  we believe a ten dollar per ton change in the price of recyclable materials will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately million and million  respectively  on an annual basis 
accordingly  a substantial rise or drop in recycled commodity prices could result in a material impact to our revenue and cost of operations 
adverse weather conditions  including those brought about by climate change  may limit our operations and increase the costs of collection and disposal 
our collection and landfill operations could be adversely impacted by extended periods of inclement weather  or by increased severity of weather and climate extremes resulting from climate change  some of which we may already be experiencing 
recent studies suggest that global warming is occurring faster than previously projected  with the world bank now projecting a fahrenheit temperature increase by the end of the century 
in addition to sea level rise  this temperature increase is expected to result in more severe droughts  floods  and other extreme weather events 
any of this could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation  interfere with collection and landfill operations  delay the development of landfill capacity or reduce the volume of waste generated by our customers 
in addition  adverse weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations  which can significantly affect our operating results in the affected regions during those periods 
we may be unable to maintain our credit ratings or execute our financial strategy 
our ability to execute our financial strategy depends in part on our ability to maintain investment grade ratings on our debt 
the credit rating process is contingent upon a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our investment grade ratings in the future 
if we were unable to do so  our interest expense would increase and our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms may be adversely affected 
our financial strategy also depends on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing business  fund internal growth  acquire other solid waste businesses  pay dividends  repurchase stock  and take other actions to enhance stockholder value 
we cannot assure you that we will succeed in executing our broad based pricing initiatives  that we will generate sufficient cash flow to execute our financial strategy  that we will be able to pay cash dividends at our present rate  or increase them  or that we will be able to continue our share repurchase program 
the solid waste industry is a capital intensive industry and our capital expenditures may exceed current expectations  which could require us to obtain additional funding for our operations or impair our ability to grow our business 
our ability to remain competitive and to grow our business largely depends on our cash flow from operations and access to capital 
if our capital efficiency programs cannot offset the impact of inflation and business growth  it may be necessary to increase the amount we spend 
additionally  if we make acquisitions or further expand our operations  the amount we spend on capital  capping  closure  post closure  environmental remediation and other items will increase 
our cash needs also will 
table of contents increase if the expenditures for capping  closure  post closure and remediation activities increase above our current estimates  which may occur over a long period due to changes in federal  state or local government requirements and other factors beyond our control 
increases in expenditures would negatively impact our cash flows 
we may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity of our landfills  which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain or maintain the permits we require to operate because permits to operate new landfills and transfer stations and to expand the permitted capacity of existing landfills have become more difficult and expensive to obtain and maintain 
permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance requirements with regard to zoning  environmental and other regulations 
these permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures 
local communities and citizen groups  adjacent landowners or governmental agencies may oppose the issuance of a permit or approval we may need  allege violations of the permits under which we currently operate or laws or regulations to which we are subject  or seek to impose liability on us for environmental damage 
responding to these challenges has at times increased our costs and extended the time associated with establishing new landfills and transfer stations and expanding existing landfills 
in addition  failure to receive regulatory and zoning approval may prohibit us from establishing new landfills or transfer stations or expanding existing landfills 
our failure to obtain the required permits to operate our landfills and transfer stations could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  we may have to dispose collected waste at landfills operated by our competitors or haul the waste long distances at a higher cost to one of our other landfills  either of which could significantly increase our waste disposal costs 
if we do not appropriately estimate landfill capping  closure and post closure costs  our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
a landfill must be closed and capped  and post closure maintenance commenced  once the landfill permitted capacity is reached and additional capacity is not authorized 
we have significant financial obligations relating to capping  closure and post closure costs at our existing owned or operated landfills  and will have material financial obligations with respect to any future owned or operated landfills 
we establish accruals for the estimated costs associated with capping  closure and post closure financial obligations 
we could underestimate such costs  and our financial obligations for capping  closure or post closure costs could exceed the amounts accrued or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds established for this purpose 
additionally  if a landfill must be closed earlier than expected or its remaining airspace is reduced for any other reason  the accruals for capping  closure and post closure could be required to be accelerated 
if our capping  closure or post closure costs exceed the amounts accrued  or if such accruals are required to be accelerated  this could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
alternatives to landfill disposal could reduce our disposal volumes and cause our revenues and operating results to decline 
most of the states in which we operate landfills require counties and municipalities to formulate comprehensive plans to reduce the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills through waste planning  composting  recycling or other programs 
some state and local governments mandate waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of wastes  such as yard waste  at landfills 
further  many of our customers voluntarily are diverting waste to alternatives to landfill disposal  such as recycling and composting  while also working to reduce the amount of waste they generate 
many of the largest companies in the us are setting zero waste goals in which they strive to send no waste to landfills 
although such actions help to protect our environment  they have reduced and will in the future reduce the volume of waste going to landfills and may affect the prices that we can charge for landfill disposal 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that we will be able to operate our landfills at their current volumes or charge current prices for landfill disposal services due to the decrease in demand for such services 
if we cannot expand our service offerings and grow lines of business to service waste streams that do not go to landfills and to provide services for customers that wish to reduce waste entirely  this could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
further  even if we can develop such service offerings and lines of business  disposal alternatives nonetheless could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the possibility of landfill and transfer station site development projects  or expansion projects not being completed or certain other events could result in material charges to income 
in accordance with us gaap  we capitalize certain expenditures relating to development  expansion and other projects 
if a facility or operation is permanently shut down or determined to be impaired  or a development  expansion or other project is not completed or is determined to be impaired  we will charge against earnings any unamortized capitalized expenditures relating to such facility or project that we are unable to recover through sale  transfer or otherwise 
we also carry a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidate balance sheets  which we must assess for impairment annually  and more frequently in 
table of contents the case of certain triggering events 
we may incur charges against earnings in accordance with this policy  or other events may cause impairments 
such charges could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
we are subject to costly environmental regulations and flow control regulations that may affect our operating margins  restrict our operations and subject us to additional liability 
complying with laws and regulations governing the collection  treatment  storage  transfer and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and materials  air quality and emissions of greenhouse gases  water quality and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances is costly 
laws and regulations often require us to enhance or replace our equipment and to modify landfill operations or initiate final closure of a landfill 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset the costs of complying with these laws and regulations 
in addition  environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase expenditures for capping  closure and post closure  and environmental and remediation activities at solid waste facilities and obligate us to spend sums in addition to those presently accrued for such purposes 
our collection  transfer  and landfill operations are and will continue to be affected by state or local laws or regulations that restrict the transportation of solid waste across state  county or other jurisdictional lines or that direct the flow of waste to a specified facility or facilities 
such laws and regulations could negatively affect our operations  resulting in declines in landfill volumes and increased costs of alternate disposal 
in addition to the costs of complying with environmental regulations  we incur costs to defend against litigation brought by government agencies and private parties who allege we are in violation of our permits and applicable environmental laws and regulations  or who assert claims alleging nuisance  environmental damage  personal injury or property damage 
as a result  we may be required to pay fines or implement corrective measures  or we may have our permits and licenses modified or revoked 
a significant judgment against us  the loss of a significant permit or license  or the imposition of a significant fine could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we establish accruals for our estimates of the costs associated with our environmental obligations 
we could underestimate such accruals and remediation costs could exceed amounts accrued 
such shortfalls could result in significant unanticipated charges to income 
regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could impose costs on our operations  the magnitude of which we cannot yet estimate 
efforts to curtail the emission of greenhouse gases and to ameliorate the effects of climate change continue to progress 
our landfill operations emit methane  identified as a greenhouse gas  and our vehicle fleet emits  among other things  carbon dioxide  which also is a greenhouse gas 
conventional wisdom still suggests that passage of comprehensive  federal climate change legislation is highly unlikely 
nonetheless  should comprehensive federal climate change legislation be enacted  we expect it to impose costs on our operations  the materiality of which we cannot predict 
absent comprehensive federal legislation to control greenhouse gas emissions  epa is moving ahead administratively under its existing clean air act authority 
epa is compelled to issue rules by the us supreme court april massachusetts v 
epa ruling that greenhouse gases are pollutants for purposes of the clean air act and epa december finding that continued emissions of greenhouse gases endanger human health and welfare 
with respect to our light and heavy duty vehicle fleet  epa has since finalized regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions and increasing fuel economy standards 
epa and nhtsa have finalized such regulations applicable to heavy duty vehicles through model year and to light duty vehicles through model year we cannot assure you that federal efforts to curtail greenhouse gas emissions and to increase the fuel efficiency of light duty and heavy duty vehicles will not have a material effect on our operations or on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
as it relates to stationary sources of greenhouse gases  in may epa finalized the prevention of significant deterioration and title v greenhouse gas tailoring rule tailoring rule 
the tailoring rule sets levels of greenhouse gas emissions at new or modified stationary emission sources that trigger permit and control obligations 
recent efforts to challenge the tailoring rule before the us court of the appeals for the district of columbia have failed 
nonetheless  in july epa issued a rule deferring the application of the tailoring rule to biogenic carbon emissions from solid waste landfills for three years  which largely exempts landfills from the tailoring rule during this period 
we cannot assure you  however  that the eventual application of the tailoring rule to our landfills will not have a material effect on our landfill operations or on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
we may have environmental liabilities that are not covered by our insurance 
changes in insurance markets also may impact our financial results 

table of contents we may incur liabilities for the deterioration of the environment as a result of our operations 
we maintain high deductibles for our environmental liability insurance coverage 
if we were to incur substantial liability for environmental damage  our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover such liability 
this could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
also  due to the variable condition of the insurance market  we may experience future increases in self insurance levels as a result of increased retention levels and increased premiums 
as we assume more risk for self insurance through higher retention levels  we may experience more variability in our self insurance reserves and expense 
despite our efforts  we may incur additional hazardous substances liability in excess of amounts presently known and accrued 
we are a potentially responsible party at many sites under cercla  which provides for the remediation of contaminated facilities and imposes strict  joint and several liability for the cost of remediation on current owners and operators of a facility at which there has been a release or a threatened release of a hazardous substance 
cercla liability also extends to parties who were site owners and operators at the time hazardous substances were disposed  and on persons who arrange for the disposal of such substances at the facility ie  generators of the waste and transporters who selected the disposal site 
hundreds of substances are defined as hazardous under cercla and their presence  even in minute amounts  can result in substantial liability 
notwithstanding our efforts to comply with applicable regulations and to avoid transporting and receiving hazardous substances  we may have additional liability under cercla  or similar state laws or rcra  in excess of our current reserves because such substances may be present in waste collected by us or disposed of in our landfills  or in waste collected  transported or disposed of in the past by companies we have acquired 
actual costs for these liabilities could be significantly greater than amounts presently accrued for these purposes  which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
currently pending or future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences  including judgments or settlements 
we are and will continue to be involved in lawsuits  regulatory inquiries  and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business 
many of these matters raise complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties 
the timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits  regulatory inquiries  and governmental and other legal proceedings is uncertain 
further  the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements  either of which could require substantial payments and adversely affect our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we may be unable to manage our growth effectively 
our growth strategy places significant demands on our financial  operational and management resources 
to continue our growth  we may need to add administrative and other personnel  and may need to make additional investments in operations and systems 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to find and train qualified personnel  or do so on a timely basis  or to expand our operations and systems to the extent  and in the time  required 
we may be unable to execute our acquisition growth strategy 
our ability to execute our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to identify and acquire desirable acquisition candidates and on our ability to successfully integrate acquired operations into our business 
the integration of our operations with those of acquired companies may present significant challenges to our management 
in addition  competition for acquisition candidates may prevent us from acquiring certain acquisition candidates 
thus  we cannot assure you that desirable acquisition candidates exist or will be identified  we will be able to acquire any of the candidates identified  we will effectively integrate companies we acquire  or any acquisitions will be profitable or accretive to our earnings 
if any of these factors force us to alter our growth strategy  our growth prospects could be adversely affected 
businesses we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities 

table of contents our due diligence investigations of acquisition candidates may fail to discover certain undisclosed liabilities 
if we acquire a company having undisclosed liabilities such as environmental  remediation or contractual liabilities  as a successor owner we may be responsible for such undisclosed liabilities 
we try to minimize our exposure to such liabilities when we can by conducting due diligence  by obtaining indemnification from each seller of the acquired companies  by deferring payment of a portion of the purchase price as security for the indemnification and by acquiring only specified assets 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain indemnification or that any indemnification obtained will be enforceable  collectible or sufficient in amount  scope or duration to fully offset any undisclosed liabilities arising from our acquisitions 
our consolidated financial statements are based on estimates and assumptions that will differ from actual results 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and necessarily include amounts based on management estimates 
actual results will differ from these amounts 
significant items requiring management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain include the recoverability of long lived assets  the depletion and amortization of landfill development costs  accruals for final capping  closure and post closure costs  valuation allowances for accounts receivable and deferred tax assets  liabilities for potential litigation  claims and assessments  and liabilities for environmental remediation  employee benefit and pension plans  deferred taxes  uncertain tax positions and self insurance 
we cannot assure you that the liabilities recorded for items such as these will be adequate to cover the costs we ultimately will face 
the introduction of new accounting rules  laws or regulations could adversely impact our results of operations 
complying with new accounting rules  laws or regulations could adversely impact our results of operations or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our results of operations in future periods 
we may be subject to workforce influences  including work stoppages  which could increase our operating costs and disrupt our operations 
as of december   approximately of our workforce was represented by various local labor unions 
if our unionized workers were to engage in strikes  work stoppages or other slowdowns  we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and an increase in our operating costs  which could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future and  if successful  the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert management attention and result in increased operating costs 
if a greater percentage of our workforce becomes unionized  our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted due to the potential for increased operating costs 
our obligation to fund multi employer pension plans to which we contribute  or our withdrawal from such plans  may have an adverse impact on us 
we contribute to multi employer pension plans under collective bargaining agreements cbas covering union represented employees 
approximately of our total current employees participate in such multi employer plans 
we do not administer these plans and generally are not represented on the boards of trustees of these plans 
the pension protection act enacted in the ppa requires under funded pension plans to improve their funding ratios 
based on the information available to us  we believe that some of the multi employer plans to which we contribute are either critical or endangered as those terms are defined in the ppa 
except as discussed in the following four paragraphs and note to our consolidated financial statements  employee benefit plans  we cannot determine at this time the amount of additional funding  if any  we may be required to make to these plans and  therefore  have not recorded any related liabilities 
however  plan assessments could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flows for a given period 
further  under current law  upon the termination of a multi employer pension plan  or in the event of a withdrawal by us which we consider from time to time or a mass withdrawal of contributing employers each  a withdrawal event  we would be required to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the plan unfunded vested liabilities 
we cannot assure you that there will not be a withdrawal event with respect to any of the multi employer pension plans to which we contribute or that  in the event of such a withdrawal event  the amounts we would be required to contribute would not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we have cbas with local bargaining units of the teamsters under which we have obligations to contribute to the central states  southeast and southwest areas pension fund the fund 
all of these cbas have been  are or will be under negotiation in the remainder of as part of our negotiations  we have proposed or intend to propose to withdraw from the fund 
withdrawal is only one of the issues in these negotiations  and we do not know what the ultimate outcome of the negotiations in any locale will be 
with respect to each cba  if we do withdraw  this will constitute a withdrawal event and will require us to make payments to the fund for a proportionate share of its unfunded vested liabilities 

table of contents during  we had withdrawal events with respect to two of our facilities 
based on information provided to us by the fund  our actuarial calculations and a number of other variable factors including our estimated number of contribution based units  we have estimated our liability to the fund associated with these two withdrawal events will be approximately million  which was charged to earnings during the three months ended september  if we do have an additional withdrawal event or events with respect to one or more of the remaining bargaining units  the amount ultimately payable would depend upon a number of variable factors involving valuations and actuarial calculations 
we do not presently know what the result of those calculations and valuations would be 
however  we believe our additional liability upon a complete withdrawal from the fund would be between million and million if it were to occur in  based on current estimates 
in the future  a loss may become probable  at which time or times we will incur an expense that will reduce earnings

the consumer price index varies from a single historical stated period of time or an average of trailing historical rates over a stated period of time

the difference between property and equipment received and purchases of property and equipment is approximately million of property and equipment received during  but paid for in results of operations years ended december   and revenue we generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations 
our remaining revenue is from other services  including transfer stations  landfill disposal and recycling 
our revenue from collection operations consists of fees we receive from commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers 
our residential and commercial collection operations in some markets are based on long term contracts with municipalities 
certain of our municipal contracts have annual price escalation clauses that are tied to changes in an underlying base index such as the consumer price index 
we generally provide commercial and industrial collection services to customers under contracts with terms up to three years 
our transfer stations  landfills and  to a lesser extent  our recycling centers generate revenue from disposal or tipping fees 
in general  we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recyclable materials 
other non core revenue consists primarily of revenue from national accounts  which represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide contracts in markets outside our operating areas  and  as such  the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators 
consequently  substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs  which are recorded in cost of operations

the impact of the change in fuel recovery fees was diminished in as the average fuel price per gallon increased approximately from to as compared to approximately from to for and  we were able to recover approximately and  respectively  of our fuel costs with fuel recovery fees 
volume decreased revenue by in volume declines were primarily in our landfill  transfer station and non core lines of business primarily due to the acquisition of a large national broker by a competitor and the loss of a large national accounts contract 
within the landfill business  special waste and construction and demolition volumes decreased by approximately and  respectively  and landfill municipal solid waste volumes declined approximately versus the prior year 
volume declines in special waste were caused by special waste event work not recurring in and being postponed due to continuing weak economic conditions 
the decline in landfill municipal solid waste volumes relate primarily to a loss of certain municipal disposal contracts in our east region and competitive pressures in our los angeles market 
collection volumes were positive year over year with most improvements coming from the commercial and industrial lines of business 

table of contents recycling commodities decreased revenue by in due to a decrease in the market price of materials 
average prices for old corrugated cardboard occ in were per ton versus per ton in  a decrease of per ton or 
average prices of old newspaper onp for were per ton versus per ton in  a decrease of per ton or 
the declines in prices were partially offset by increased volumes processed 
our recycling commodity volume of million tons was higher than volumes 
changing market demand for recyclable materials causes volatility in commodity prices 
at current volumes and mix of materials  we believe a ten dollar per ton change in the price of recyclable materials will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately million and million  respectively  on an annual basis 
revenue versus the increase in revenue in compared to is due to the following core price increased revenue by and  respectively 
the lower core price increase in compared to is due primarily to the competitive municipal and franchise contract pricing environment in our residential collection line of business and the continued low inflationary environment  which limits our price increases on index based contracts  partially offset by our continued broad based pricing initiatives particularly in our landfill line of business 
fuel recovery fees increased revenue by and  respectively

volume decreased revenue by and  respectively 
volume continued to decline throughout  but at a lower rate of decline than earlier in the year or during volume in our industrial collection and landfill lines of business was positive in primarily driven by special event work  offset by declines in our commercial and residential collection and transfer station lines of business

thus  you should take care when comparing our cost of operations by cost component to that of other companies 
cost of operations versus our cost of operations  as a percentage of revenue  increased in compared to  primarily as a result of the following labor and related benefits increased due to merit based wage increases in versus as well as increases in health care costs 
as a percentage of revenue  labor and related benefits were negatively impacted by the relative mix of higher collection revenue and lower landfill  transfer  commodity and subcontract revenue compared to because these revenues have little or no variable labor costs 
maintenance and repairs expense increased due to costs associated with our fleet maintenance initiative as well as the increased cost of tires and container refurbishment expenses 
during  our fuel costs in aggregate dollars and as a percentage revenue increased million and  respectively  compared to primarily due to higher fuel prices 
average fuel costs per gallon for were versus for  an increase of or at current consumption levels  a twenty cent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately million on an annual basis 
offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers

franchise fees and taxes increased during primarily due to the acquisition of businesses in franchise markets 
landfill operating expenses in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue increased million and  respectively  during compared to  primarily due to million of remediation charges we recorded in connection with environmental conditions at a closed disposal facility in missouri 
risk management expenses increased during primarily due to lower favorable actuarial development compared to the prior year

the average price for occ for was per ton versus per ton for the comparable period 
the average price of onp for was per ton versus per ton for the comparable period 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in labor and related benefits expenses due to volume related workforce reductions  including the expiration of the san mateo contract  as well as increased productivity gains primarily due to the automation of our residential fleet and lower benefit plan costs 
partially offsetting these declines were increases in overall wages and increases in workforce due to acquisitions

a decrease in transportation and subcontract costs primarily due to the expiration of our san mateo county contract and our transportation and disposal contract with the city of toronto and a decline in our overall collection volumes 
partially offsetting these decreases were increases due to fuel recovery fees related to project work with certain of our national accounts customers 
depreciation  amortization and depletion of property and equipment the following table summarizes depreciation  amortization and depletion of property and equipment for the years ended december   and in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue depreciation and amortization of property and equipment landfill depletion and amortization depreciation  amortization and depletion expense depreciation and amortization of property and equipment increased million for versus  primarily due to higher costs of residential side loaders for automating our residential collection routes and an increased number of cng vehicles  which are more expensive than diesel vehicles 
in addition  we made increased investments in new and upgraded recycling infrastructure projects that became operational in landfill depletion and amortization expense increased million for versus  primarily due to unfavorable adjustments to landfill depletion and amortization expense for asset retirement obligations of million recorded during versus favorable adjustments of million recorded during offsetting the increase in costs relative to asset retirement obligations was an overall decline in landfill depletion due to lower disposal volumes  as previously noted in our revenue 
table of contents versus discussion 
landfill depletion and amortization expense increased in aggregate dollars slightly during versus due to increased volumes year over year 
amortization of other intangible and other assets expenses for amortization of intangible and other assets were million  million and million  or  as a percentage of revenue  for  and  respectively 
our other intangible and other assets primarily relate to customer lists  franchise agreements  municipal contracts  trade names  favorable lease assets and to a lesser extent non compete agreements 
amortization of intangible assets in aggregate dollars decreased during as compared to primarily due to municipal agreement intangibles acquired from allied that are now fully amortized 
accretion expense accretion expenses were million  million and million  or  as a percentage of revenue    and for  and  respectively 
the amounts have remained relatively unchanged as our asset retirement obligations remained relatively consistent period over period 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include salaries  health and welfare benefits and incentive compensation for corporate and field general management  field support functions  sales force  accounting and finance  legal  management information systems  and clerical and administrative departments 
other expenses include rent and office costs  fees for professional services provided by third parties  marketing  investor and community relations  directors and officers insurance  general employee relocation  travel  entertainment and bank charges  but excludes any such amounts recorded as restructuring charges 
the following table provides the components of our selling  general and administrative expenses for the three years ended december   and in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue salaries provision for doubtful accounts costs to achieve synergies other total selling  general and administrative expenses the cost categories shown above may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies 
thus  you should take care when comparing our selling  general and administrative expenses by cost component to that of other companies 
selling  general and administrative expenses versus our salaries expenses decreased million and remained consistent as a percentage of revenue for versus the decrease is primarily due to lower management incentive pay due to our revised financial expectations offset by merit wage increases and the expansion of our sales team in the second half of provision for doubtful accounts increased due to an increase in unrecoverable amounts from certain customers and the recovery during of accounts previously written off 
other selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million or  as a percentage of revenue  for versus primarily as a result of a decrease in legal fees and settlements and consulting and professional fees partially offset by higher recruiting and relocation expenses

reportable segments our operations are managed through three geographic regions that we designate as our reportable segments 
the historical results  discussion and presentation of our reportable segments as set forth in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented reflect the impact of the realignment of our operating structure in the fourth quarter of summary financial information concerning our reportable segments for the years ended december   and is shown in the following table in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue net revenue depletion and accretion before adjustments for asset retirement obligations amortization expense for asset retirement obligations depreciation  amortization  depletion and accretion gain loss on disposition of assets and impairments  net operating income loss operating margin east central west corporate entities total east central west corporate entities total east central west corporate entities total corporate entities include legal  tax  treasury  information technology  risk management  human resources  closed landfills  and other typical administrative functions 
national accounts revenue included in corporate entities represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide contracts in markets outside our operating areas  where the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators 
consequently  substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs  which are recorded in cost of operations 
significant changes in the revenue and operating margins of our reportable segments comparing to and to are discussed in the following paragraphs 
compared to east region revenue for the year ended december  declined due primarily to declines in volume in our collection  landfill and transfer station lines of business  coupled with lower recycling commodity revenue and price decreases in our collection line of business 
the volume declines were primarily due to the loss of a large national accounts contract and the loss of certain disposal contracts 
these decreases were partially offset by price increases in the landfill and transfer station lines of business for operating income margin in our east region decreased from in to in or 
in addition to the impact of the decrease in revenue  the following cost categories impacted operating income 
table of contents cost of operations negatively impacted operating income due to higher labor and benefits  fuel and repair and maintenance costs 
environmental costs increased primarily due to higher leachate disposal costs  third party survey and engineering costs and other landfill maintenance 
these unfavorable items were partially offset by favorable transfer  disposal  subcontract and transportation costs primarily due to lower disposal prices and volumes 
in addition  cost of goods sold declined primarily due to lower market value of recycled commodities offset by an increase in volume of commodities sold 
depreciation  amortization  depletion and accretion favorably impacted operating income primarily due to favorable adjustments for asset retirement obligations of million in versus million in selling  general administrative costs decreased operating income primarily due to wage increases  higher legal fees and settlements and higher provision for doubtful accounts 
gain loss on disposition of assets and impairments  net had a favorable impact on operating income in versus primarily due to a million net gain on the divestiture of a collection business and the sale of certain assets associated with our rail logistics business in during  we disposed of businesses in three markets resulting in a net gain of million 
in connection with the disposition of these businesses  we closed a landfill site resulting in an asset impairment charge of million for the remaining landfill assets and the acceleration of capping  closure and post closure costs 
in addition  in we recorded asset impairments of million primarily related to certain long lived assets that were held for sale 
central region revenue for the year ended december  declined primarily due to a decline in volumes in our transfer station and landfill lines of business and a decline in recycling commodity revenue as a result of decreases in commodity prices 
the volume declines were primarily due to the loss of a large national accounts contract and special waste event work not recurring in these decreases were partially offset by an increase in core price growth in all lines of business and volume increases in all collection lines of business for the year ended december  operating income margin in our central region decreased from in to in or primarily as a result of the following cost of operations negatively impacted operating income due to higher labor and benefits  fuel and repair and maintenance costs 
environmental costs increased primarily due to higher gas maintenance and third party survey and engineering costs 
these unfavorable items were partially offset by favorable cost of goods sold primarily due to a decline in market value of recycled commodities offset by an increase in volume of commodities sold 
depreciation  amortization  depletion and accretion unfavorably impacted operating income primarily due to favorable adjustments for asset retirement obligations of million in compared to million in selling  general administrative costs decreased operating income primarily due to wage increases  higher legal fees and settlements and higher provision for doubtful accounts 
west region revenue for the year ended december  increased due to an increase in core price in all lines of business and an increase in volumes in our commercial and industrial collection lines of business 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in volumes in our residential collection  landfill and transfer station lines of business as well as lower recycling commodity revenue 
the volume declines in our landfill line of business were primarily due to competitive disposal pricing and special waste event work not recurring in operating income margin in our west region decreased from in to in or primarily as a result of the following cost of operations negatively impacted operating income due to higher labor and benefits  fuel  franchise fees and repair and maintenance costs 
cost of operations was higher as a percent of revenue in part due to lower special waste event work in  which has a lower operating cost associated with it 
environmental costs increased primarily due to a million charge recorded in connection with environmental conditions at our closed disposal facility in nevada 

table of contents depreciation  amortization  depletion and accretion favorably impacted operating income primarily due to lower landfill volumes 
selling  general administrative costs contributed to a decrease in operating income primarily due to increased legal fees and settlements 
gain loss on disposition of assets and impairments  net favorably impacted operating income as compared to primarily as a result of prior year asset impairments of million for expected losses on the divestiture of certain businesses 
these assets were subsequently sold in the third quarter of resulting in no further loss 
offsetting this impairment expense was a million gain on sale recorded in connection with a separate business disposition 
corporate entities during the year ended december   the corporate entities had an operating loss of million versus a loss of million for the operating loss for the year ended december  was favorably impacted by lower management incentive pay  lower legal fees and lower consulting expenses 
these favorable adjustments were more than offset by unfavorable remediation adjustments due to a million charge recorded in connection with environmental conditions at a closed disposal facility in missouri and adjustments to asset retirement obligations totaling million at other closed landfills 
in addition  during we recorded a charge to earnings of million primarily related to our partial withdrawal from central states pension fund 
in october  we restructured our field and corporate operations to create a more efficient and competitive company 
we incurred million of restructuring charges that consisted of severance and other employee termination benefits  relocation benefits  and the closure of offices with lease agreements with non cancellable terms ranging from to years 
compared to east region revenue for the year ended december  declined primarily due to volume decreases offset by increases in core price  recycling commodity revenue and fuel recovery fees 
in addition  revenue for declined as a result of business divestitures 
operating margin in our east region decreased from in to in as a result of the following cost of operations negatively impacted operating income due primarily to higher fuel  cost of goods sold related to commodities and maintenance costs 
these unfavorable items were partially offset by lower disposal  subcontract and transportation costs as well as lower labor and related benefit costs 
depreciation  amortization  depletion and accretion unfavorably impacted operating income primarily due to lower favorable adjustments to landfill amortization expense for asset retirement obligations of million in compared to million in during we disposed of businesses in three markets in our east region resulting in a net gain of million 
in connection with the disposition of these businesses  we closed a landfill resulting in an asset impairment charge of million for the remaining landfill assets and the acceleration of capping  closure and post closure costs 
in addition  we recorded asset impairments of million primarily related to certain long lived assets that are held for sale 
during  we divested hauling operations and three transfer stations in new york for aggregate proceeds of approximately million and recognized a loss on disposition of million including costs to sell 
central region revenue for the year ended december  increased due to core price and fuel recovery fee growth and an increase in recycling commodity revenue 
these increases were partially offset by volume declines in our residential collection  transfer station and disposal lines of business  in part due to the expiration of the city of toronto transportation and disposal contract 
operating income margin in our central region decreased from in to in as a result of the following 
table of contents cost of operations negatively impacted operating income due to higher fuel  cost of goods sold related to commodities  labor and related benefits and maintenance costs

offsetting this impairment expense was a million gain on sale recorded in connection with a separate business disposition 
corporate entities during the year ended december   the corporate entities had operating losses of million versus million for during  we recorded a gain on the disposition of assets and impairments of million versus an impairment loss of million related to certain long lived assets that were held and used for during  we incurred million of incremental costs to achieve our synergy plan and million of restructuring and integration charges related to our acquisition of allied 
operating margins for also were impacted by higher litigation and management incentive plan costs 
landfill and environmental matters our landfill costs include daily operating expenses  costs of capital for cell development  costs for final capping  closure and post closure  and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance 
daily operating expenses include leachate treatment and disposal  methane gas and groundwater monitoring and system maintenance  interim cap maintenance  and costs associated with applying daily cover materials 
we expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred 
we use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to landfill development 
in life cycle accounting  certain direct costs are capitalized and charged to depletion expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace 
these costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site  including excavation  natural and synthetic liners  construction of leachate collection systems  installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems  installation of groundwater monitoring wells  and other costs associated with acquiring and developing the 
table of contents site 
obligations associated with final capping  closure and post closure are capitalized and amortized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed 
cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers 
our operating and accounting personnel use these estimates to adjust the rates we use to expense capitalized costs 
changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in costs  available airspace  inflation and applicable regulations 
changes in available airspace include changes in engineering estimates  changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted 
available airspace the following tables reflect landfill airspace activity for active landfills owned or operated by us for the years ended december   and balance as of december  new expansions undertaken landfills acquired  net of divestitures permits granted  net of closures airspace consumed changes in engineering estimates balance as of december  cubic yards in millions permitted airspace probable expansion airspace total cubic yards in millions number of sites permitted airspace probable expansion airspace balance as of december  new expansions undertaken landfills acquired  net of divestitures permits granted  net of closures airspace consumed changes in engineering estimates balance as of december  cubic yards in millions permitted airspace probable expansion airspace total cubic yards in millions number of sites permitted airspace probable expansion airspace balance as of december  new expansions undertaken landfills acquired  net of divestitures permits granted  net of closures airspace consumed changes in engineering estimates balance as of december  cubic yards in millions permitted airspace probable expansion airspace total cubic yards in millions number of sites permitted airspace probable expansion airspace changes in engineering estimates typically include modifications to the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a refinement of the capacity calculations resulting from updated information 
as of december   we owned or operated active solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be billion in place cubic yards 
total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted 
table of contents airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace 
engineers develop these estimates at least annually using information provided by annual aerial surveys 
as of december   total available disposal capacity is estimated to be billion in place cubic yards of permitted airspace plus billion in place cubic yards of probable expansion airspace 
before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and  therefore  included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity  it must meet all of our expansion criteria 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  landfill and environmental costs  to our consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further information 
as of december   ten of our landfills met all of our criteria for including their probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity 
at projected annual volumes  these landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of years  including probable expansion airspace 
the average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is years 
we have other expansion opportunities that are not included in our total available airspace because they do not meet all of our criteria for probable expansion airspace 
the following table reflects the estimated operating lives of our active landfill sites based on available and probable disposal capacity using current annual volumes as of december  number of sites without probable expansion airspace number of sites with probable expansion airspace total sites percent of total to years to years to years to years years total final capping  closure and post closure costs as of december   accrued final capping  closure and post closure costs were  million  of which million is current and million is long term as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in accrued landfill and environmental costs 
remediation and other charges for landfill matters in december  we finalized our purchase price allocation for the environmental liabilities we assumed as part of the allied acquisition 
these liabilities represent our estimate of costs to remediate sites that were previously owned or operated by allied or sites at which allied  or a predecessor company that it had acquired  had been identified as a potentially responsible party 
the remediation of these sites is in various stages of completion from having received an initial notice from a regulatory agency and commencing investigation to being in the final stages of post remedial monitoring 
see also note  summary of significant accounting policies environmental remediation liabilities  to our consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further information 
we have recorded these liabilities at their estimated fair values using a discount rate of 
discounted liabilities are accreted to interest expense through the period that they are paid

as of december   we had million of libor borrowings 
the agreements governing our credit facilities require us to comply with certain financial and other covenants 
we may pay dividends and repurchase common stock if we are in compliance with these covenants 
compliance with these covenants is a condition for any incremental borrowings under our credit facilities and failure to meet these covenants would enable the lenders to require repayment of any outstanding loans which would adversely affect our liquidity 
as of december   our ebitda to interest ratio was compared to the minimum required by the covenants  and our total debt to ebitda ratio was compared to the maximum allowed by the covenants 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facilities  and we expect to be in compliance throughout ebitda  which is a non gaap measure  is calculated as defined in our credit facility agreements

tax exempt financings as of december  and  we had  million and  million  respectively  of fixed and variable rate tax exempt financings outstanding with maturities ranging from to approximately of our tax exempt financings are remarketed quarterly  weekly or daily by a remarketing agent to effectively maintain a variable yield 
certain of these variable rate tax exempt financings are credit enhanced with letters of credit having terms in excess of one year issued by banks with investment grade credit ratings 
the holders of the bonds can put them back to the remarketing agent at the end of each interest period 
to date  the remarketing agents have been able to remarket our variable rate unsecured tax exempt bonds 
these bonds have been classified as long term because of our ability and intent to refinance them using availability under our credit facilities  if necessary 
as of december   we had million of restricted cash and marketable securities  of which million represented proceeds from the issuance of tax exempt bonds and other tax exempt financings and will be used to fund capital expenditures under the terms of the agreements 
restricted cash and marketable securities also include amounts held in trust as a financial guarantee of our performance 
fuel hedges we use derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in diesel fuel prices

additionally  we were able to recover approximately of our fuel costs with fuel recovery fees from certain of our customers 
recycling commodity hedges revenue from sale of recycling commodities is primarily from sales of old corrugated cardboard occ and old newspaper onp 
we use derivative instruments such as swaps and costless collars designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in prices of these commodities

contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in millions year ending december  operating leases maturities of notes payable  capital leases and other long term debt final capping  closure and post closure remediation unconditional purchase commitments total thereafter total we intend to use excess cash on hand and cash from operating activities to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions  dividend payments  share repurchases and debt repayments 
actual debt repayments may include purchases of our outstanding indebtedness in the secondary market or otherwise 
we believe that our excess cash  cash from operating activities and proceeds from our revolving credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and maturing obligations as they come due 
in the future  we may choose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity dates using cash from operations or additional borrowings 
we also may explore opportunities in the capital markets to fund redemptions should market conditions be favorable 
the present value of capital lease obligations is included in our consolidated balance sheets 
the estimated remaining final capping  closure and post closure and remediation expenditures presented above are not inflated 
table of contents or discounted and reflect the estimated future payments for liabilities incurred and recorded as of december  unconditional purchase commitments consist primarily of disposal related agreements that include fixed or minimum royalty payments  host agreements and take or pay and put or pay agreements and other obligations including committed capital expenditures and consulting service agreements 
debt covenants our credit facilities contain financial covenants 
we can pay dividends and repurchase common stock if we are in compliance with these covenants 
at december   we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants under our credit facilities 
we were also in compliance with the non financial covenants in the indentures relating to our senior notes as of december  we expect to be in compliance with our covenants during failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our credit facilities  as well as the occurrence of certain material adverse events  would constitute defaults and would allow the lenders under our credit facilities to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreements 
this could also have an adverse impact on the availability of financial assurances 
in addition  maturity acceleration on our credit facilities constitutes an event of default under our other debt instruments  including our senior notes  and  therefore  our senior notes would also be subject to acceleration of maturity 
if such acceleration were to occur  we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness 
we would likely have to seek an amendment under our credit facilities for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity  or asset sales  if necessary 
we may be unable to amend our credit facilities or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated 
financial assurance we must provide financial assurance to governmental agencies and a variety of other entities under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping  closure and post closure costs  and related to our performance under certain collection  landfill and transfer station contracts 
we satisfy these financial assurance requirements by providing surety bonds  letters of credit  or insurance policies the financial assurance instruments  or trust deposits which are included in restricted cash and marketable securities and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
the amount of the financial assurance requirements for capping  closure and post closure costs is determined by applicable state environmental regulations 
the financial assurance requirements for capping  closure and post closure costs may be associated with a portion of the landfill or the entire landfill 
generally  states require a third party engineering specialist to determine the estimated capping  closure and post closure costs that are used to determine the required amount of financial assurance for a landfill 
the amount of financial assurance required can  and generally will  differ from the obligation determined and recorded under us gaap 
the amount of the financial assurance requirements related to contract performance varies by contract 
additionally  we must provide financial assurance for our insurance program and collateral for certain performance obligations 
we do not expect a material increase in financial assurance requirements during  although the mix of financial assurance instruments may change 
these financial instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not considered company indebtedness 
because we currently have no liability for the financial assurance instruments  they are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
however  we record capping  closure and post closure liabilities and self insurance liabilities as they are incurred 
the underlying obligations of the financial assurance instruments  in excess of those already reflected in our consolidated balance sheets  would be recorded if it is probable that we would be unable to fulfill our related obligations 
we do not expect this to occur 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet debt or similar obligations  other than financial assurance instruments and operating leases  that are not classified as debt 
we do not guarantee any third party debt 
free cash flow we define free cash flow  which is not a measure determined in accordance with us gaap  as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment  plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
our free cash flow for the years ended december   and is calculated as follows in millions 
table of contents cash provided by operating activities purchases of property and equipment proceeds from sales of property and equipment free cash flow for a discussion of the changes in the components of free cash flow  you should read our discussion regarding cash flows provided by operating activities and cash flows used in investing activities contained elsewhere in this form k 
purchases of property and equipment as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows and as presented in the free cash flow table above represent amounts paid during the period for such expenditures 
a reconciliation of property and equipment reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows to property and equipment received for the years ended december   and is as follows in millions purchases of property and equipment per the consolidated statements of cash flows adjustments for property and equipment received during the prior period but paid for in the following period  net property and equipment received during the period the adjustments noted above do not affect our net change in cash and cash equivalents as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
we believe that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment received  plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment 
it also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy  which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service  investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided  maintaining our investment grade rating and minimizing debt  paying cash dividends and repurchasing common stock  and maintaining and improving our market position through business optimization 
in addition  free cash flow is a key metric used to determine compensation 
the presentation of free cash flow has material limitations 
free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments 
our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 
contingencies for a description of our contingencies  see note  income taxes  and note  commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
critical accounting judgments and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management 
the following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows and that may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
such critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments are applicable to all of our operating segments 
we have noted examples of the residual accounting and business risks inherent in the accounting for these areas 
residual accounting and business risks are defined as the inherent risks that we face after the application of our policies and processes that are generally outside of our control or ability to forecast 
landfill accounting landfill operating costs are treated as period expenses and are not discussed further in this section 
our landfill assets and liabilities fall into the following two categories  each of which requires accounting judgments and estimates 
table of contents landfill development costs that are capitalized as an asset 
landfill retirement obligations relating to our capping  closure and post closure liabilities which result in a corresponding landfill retirement asset 
new claims may be asserted that are not included in our loss contingencies 
landfill development costs we use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize landfill development costs over the life of the site 
in life cycle accounting  all costs to acquire and construct a site are capitalized  and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace 
obligations associated with final capping  closure and post closure are also capitalized  and amortized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed 
cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers 
site permits 
to develop  construct and operate a landfill  we must obtain permits from various regulatory agencies at the local  state and federal levels 
the permitting process requires an initial site study to determine whether the location is feasible for landfill operations 
the initial studies are reviewed by our environmental management group and then submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval 
during the development stage we capitalize certain costs that we incur after site selection but before the receipt of all required permits if we believe that it is probable that the site will be permitted 
residual risks changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may cause changes to the landfill site permitting process 
these changes could make it more difficult and costly to obtain and maintain a landfill permit 
studies performed could be inaccurate  which could result in the denial or revocation of a permit and changes to accounting assumptions 
conditions could exist that were not identified in the study  which may make the location not feasible for a landfill and could result in the denial of a permit 
denial or revocation of a permit could impair the recorded value of the landfill asset 
actions by neighboring parties  private citizen groups or others to oppose our efforts to obtain  maintain or expand permits could result in denial  revocation or suspension of a permit  which could adversely impact the economic viability of the landfill and could impair the recorded value of the landfill 
as a result of opposition to our obtaining a permit  improved technical information as a project progresses  or changes in the anticipated economics associated with a project  we may decide to reduce the scope of or abandon a project  which could result in an asset impairment 
technical landfill design 
upon receipt of initial regulatory approval  technical landfill designs are prepared 
the technical designs  which include the detailed specifications to develop and construct all components of the landfill including the types and quantities of materials that will be required  are reviewed by our environmental management group 
the technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval 
upon approval of the technical designs  the regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the landfill 
residual risks changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may require changes in the landfill technical designs 
these changes could make it more difficult and costly to meet new design standards 
technical design requirements  as approved  may need modifications at some future point in time 
technical designs could be inaccurate and could result in increased construction costs  difficulty in obtaining a permit or the use of rates to recognize the amortization of landfill development costs and asset retirement obligations that are not appropriate 
permitted and probable landfill disposal capacity 
included in the technical designs are factors that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill 
these factors include the area over which the landfill will be developed  such as the depth of excavation  the height of the landfill elevation and the angle of the side slope construction 
the disposal capacity of the landfill is calculated in cubic yards 
this measurement of volume is then converted to a disposal capacity expressed in tons based on a site specific expected density to be achieved over the remaining operating life of the landfill 

table of contents residual risks estimates of future disposal capacity may change as a result of changes in legislative or regulatory design requirements 
the density of waste may vary due to variations in operating conditions  including waste compaction practices  site design  climate and the nature of the waste 
capacity is defined in cubic yards but waste received is measured in tons 
the number of tons per cubic yard varies by type of waste and our rate of compaction 
development costs 
the types of costs that are detailed in the technical design specifications generally include excavation  natural and synthetic liners  construction of leachate collection systems  installation of methane gas collection systems and monitoring probes  installation of groundwater monitoring wells  construction of leachate management facilities and other costs associated with the development of the site 
we review the adequacy of our cost estimates on an annual basis by comparing estimated costs with third party bids or contractual arrangements  reviewing the changes in year over year cost estimates for reasonableness  and comparing our resulting development cost per acre with prior period costs 
these development costs  together with any costs incurred to acquire  design and permit the landfill  including capitalized interest  are recorded to the landfill asset on the balance sheet as incurred 
residual risk actual future costs of construction materials and third party labor could differ from the costs we have estimated because of the availability of the required materials and labor 
technical designs could be altered due to unexpected operating conditions  regulatory changes or legislative changes 
landfill development asset amortization 
to match the expense related to the landfill asset with the revenue generated by the landfill operations  we amortize the landfill development asset over its operating life on a per ton basis as waste is accepted at the landfill 
the landfill asset is fully amortized at the end of a landfill s operating life 
the per ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill development asset net book value plus estimated future development costs as described above for the landfill by the landfill s estimated remaining disposal capacity 
the expected future development costs are not inflated or discounted  but rather expressed in nominal dollars 
this rate is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill to arrive at amortization expense for the period 
amortization rates are influenced by the original cost basis of the landfill  including acquisition costs  which in turn is determined by geographic location and market values 
we secure significant landfill assets through business acquisitions and value them at the time of acquisition based on fair value 
amortization rates are also influenced by site specific engineering and cost factors 
residual risk changes in our future development cost estimates or our disposal capacity will normally result in a change in our amortization rates and will impact amortization expense prospectively 
an unexpected significant increase in estimated costs or reduction in disposal capacity could affect the ongoing economic viability of the landfill and result in asset impairment 
on at least an annual basis  we update the estimates of future development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each landfill 
these costs and disposal capacity estimates are reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually 
changes in cost estimates and disposal capacity are reflected prospectively in the landfill amortization rates that are updated annually 
landfill asset retirement obligations we have two types of retirement obligations related to landfills capping and closure and post closure 
obligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill are recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event 
obligations related to closure and post closure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations are recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire life of the landfill 
landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the units of consumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed within the entire landfill  depending on the nature of the obligation 
all obligations are initially measured at 
table of contents estimated fair value 
fair value is calculated on a present value basis using an inflation rate and our credit adjusted  risk free rate in effect at the time the liabilities were incurred 
future costs for final capping  closure and post closure are developed at least annually by engineers  and are inflated to future value using estimated future payment dates and inflation rate projections 
landfill capping 
as individual areas within each landfill reach capacity  we must cap and close the areas in accordance with the landfill site permit 
these requirements are detailed in the technical design of the landfill site process previously described 
closure and post closure 
closure costs are costs incurred after a landfill stops receiving waste  but prior to being certified as closed 
after the entire landfill has reached capacity and is certified closed  we must continue to maintain and monitor the site for a post closure period  which generally extends for years 
costs associated with closure and post closure requirements generally include maintenance of the site  the monitoring of methane gas collection systems and groundwater systems  and other activities that occur after the site has ceased accepting waste 
costs associated with post closure monitoring generally include groundwater sampling  analysis and statistical reports  third party labor associated with gas system operations and maintenance  transportation and disposal of leachate  and erosion control costs related to the final cap 
landfill retirement obligation liabilities and assets 
estimates of the total future costs required to cap  close and monitor each landfill as specified by the landfill permit are updated annually 
the estimates include inflation  the specific timing of future cash outflows  and the anticipated waste flow into the capping events 
our cost estimates are inflated to the period of performance using an estimate of inflation  which is updated annually and is based upon the ten year average consumer price index in both and 
the present value of the remaining capping costs for specific capping events and the remaining closure and post closure costs for each landfill are recorded as incurred on a per ton basis 
these liabilities are incurred as disposal capacity is consumed at the landfill 
capping  closure and post closure liabilities are recorded in layers and discounted using our credit adjusted risk free rate in effect at the time the obligation is incurred in and in 
retirement obligations are increased each year to reflect the passage of time by accreting the balance at the weighted average credit adjusted risk free rate that was used to calculate each layer of the recorded liabilities 
this accretion is charged to operating expenses 
actual cash expenditures reduce the asset retirement obligation liabilities as they are made 
corresponding retirement obligation assets are recorded for the same value as the additions to the capping  closure and post closure liabilities 
the retirement obligation assets are amortized to expense on a per ton basis as disposal capacity is consumed 
the per ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of each of the recorded retirement obligation asset s net book value and expected future additions to the retirement obligation asset by the remaining disposal capacity 
a per ton rate is determined for each separate capping event based on the disposal capacity relating to that event 
closure and post closure per ton rates are based on the total disposal capacity of the landfill 
residual risks changes in legislative or regulatory requirements  including changes in capping  closure activities or post closure monitoring activities  types and quantities of materials used  or term of post closure care  could cause changes in our cost estimates 
changes in the landfill retirement obligation due to changes in the anticipated waste flow  changes in airspace compaction estimates or changes in the timing of expenditures for closed landfills and fully incurred but unpaid capping events are recorded in results of operations prospectively 
this could result in unanticipated increases or decreases in expense 
actual timing of disposal capacity utilization could differ from projected timing  causing differences in timing of when amortization and accretion expense is recognized for capping  closure and post closure liabilities 
changes in inflation rates could impact our actual future costs and our total liabilities 
changes in our capital structure or market conditions could result in changes to the credit adjusted risk free rate used to discount the liabilities  which could cause changes in future recorded liabilities  assets and expense 
amortization rates could change in the future based on the evaluation of new facts and circumstances relating to landfill capping design  post closure monitoring requirements  or the inflation or discount rate 

table of contents on an annual basis  we update our estimates of future capping  closure and post closure costs and of future disposal capacity for each landfill 
revisions in estimates of our costs or timing of expenditures are recognized immediately as increases or decreases to the capping  closure and post closure liabilities and the corresponding retirement obligation assets 
changes in the assets result in changes to the amortization rates which are applied prospectively  except for fully incurred capping events and closed landfills  where the changes are recorded immediately in results of operations since the associated disposal capacity has already been consumed 
permitted and probable disposal capacity 
disposal capacity is determined by the specifications detailed in the landfill permit 
we classify this disposal capacity as permitted 
we also include probable expansion disposal capacity in our remaining disposal capacity estimates  thus including additional disposal capacity being sought through means of a permit expansion 
probable expansion disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the applicable regulatory agencies  but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and that the successful completion of the expansion is probable 
we have developed six criteria that must be met before an expansion area is designated as probable expansion airspace 
we believe that satisfying all of these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be permitted 
however  because some of these criteria are judgmental  they may exclude expansion airspace that will eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will not be permitted 
in either of these scenarios  our amortization  depletion and accretion expense could change significantly 
our internal criteria to classify disposal capacity as probable expansion airspace are as follows we own the land associated with the expansion airspace or control it pursuant to an option agreement  we are committed to supporting the expansion project financially and with appropriate resources  there are no identified fatal flaws or impediments associated with the project  including political impediments  progress is being made on the project  the expansion is attainable within a reasonable time frame  and we believe it is likely we will receive the expansion permit 
after successfully meeting these criteria  the disposal capacity that will result from the planned expansion is included in our remaining disposal capacity estimates 
additionally  for purposes of calculating landfill amortization and capping  closure and post closure rates  we include the incremental costs to develop  construct  close and monitor the related probable expansion disposal capacity 
residual risk we may be unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity because of the failure to obtain the final local  state or federal permits or due to other unknown reasons 
if we are unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity  or the disposal capacity for which we obtain approvals is less than what was estimated  both our estimated total costs and disposal capacity will be reduced  which generally increases the rates we charge for landfill amortization and capping  closure and post closure accruals 
an unexpected decrease in disposal capacity could also cause an asset impairment 
environmental liabilities we are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment  and we remediate sites in the ordinary course of our business 
under current laws and regulations  we may be responsible for environmental remediation at sites that we either own or operate  including sites that we have acquired  or sites where we have or a company that we have acquired has delivered waste 
our environmental remediation liabilities primarily include costs associated with remediating groundwater  surface water and soil contamination  as well as controlling and containing methane gas migration and the related legal costs 
to estimate our ultimate liability at these sites  we evaluate several factors  including the nature and extent of contamination at each identified site  the required remediation methods  the apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties and the financial viability of those parties 
we accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with accounting for loss contingencies 
we periodically review the status of all environmental matters and update our estimates of the likelihood of and future expenditures for remediation as necessary 
changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recognized currently in earnings in the period in which the adjustment is known 
adjustments to estimates are reasonably possible in the near term and may result in changes to recorded amounts 
with the exception of those obligations assumed in the acquisition of 
table of contents allied that were recorded at estimated fair value  environmental obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis 
we have not reduced the liabilities we have recorded for recoveries from other potentially responsible parties or insurance companies 
residual risks we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of our environmental remediation liabilities 
our estimates of these liabilities require assumptions about uncertain future events 
thus  our estimates could change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of contamination  the required remediation methods  the final apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties identified  the financial viability of those parties  and the actions of governmental agencies or private parties with interests in the matter 
actual amounts could differ from the estimated liabilities as a result of changes in estimated future litigation costs to pursue the matter to ultimate resolution 
an unanticipated environmental liability that arises could result in a material charge to our consolidated statement of income 
self insurance reserves and related costs our insurance programs for workers compensation  commercial general and auto liability  environmental and remediation liability  and employee related health care benefits are either self insured or subject to large deductible insurance policies 
accruals for self insurance reserves are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
we maintain high deductibles for commercial general liability  automobile liability and workers compensation coverage  ranging from million to million 
residual risks incident rates  including frequency and severity  and other actuarial assumptions could change causing our current and future actuarially determined obligations to change  which would be reflected in our consolidated statement of income in the period in which such adjustment is known 
recorded reserves may not be adequate to cover the future payment of claims 
adjustments  if any  to estimates recorded resulting from ultimate claim payments would be reflected in the consolidated statements of income in the periods in which such adjustments are known 
the settlement costs to discharge our obligations  including legal and health care costs  could increase or decrease causing current estimates of our self insurance reserves to change 
loss contingencies we are subject to various legal proceedings  claims and regulatory matters  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
we determine whether to disclose material loss contingencies or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote  reasonably possible or probable  and whether it can be reasonably estimated 
we analyze our litigation and regulatory matters based on available information to assess the potential liabilities 
management develops its assessment based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies 
we record and disclose loss contingencies pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance for such matter 
we record losses related to contingencies in cost of operations or selling  general and administrative expenses  depending on the nature of the underlying transaction leading to the loss contingency 
residual risks actual costs may vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons  including differing interpretations of laws  opinions on culpability and assessments of the amount of damages 
loss contingency assumptions involve judgments that are inherently subjective and generally involve matters that are by their nature complex and unpredictable 
if a loss contingency results in an adverse judgment or is settled for a significant amount  it could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows in the period in which such judgment or settlement occurs 

table of contents new claims may be asserted that are not included in our loss contingencies 
asset impairment valuation methodology 
we evaluate our long lived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable based on projected cash flows anticipated to be generated from the ongoing operation of those assets or we intend to sell or otherwise dispose of the assets 
residual risk if events or changes in circumstances occur  including reductions in anticipated cash flows generated by our operations or determinations to divest assets  certain assets could be impaired  which would result in a non cash charge to earnings 
evaluation criteria 
we test long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable 
examples of such events could include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a long lived asset  a change in its physical condition  or new circumstances that could cause an expectation that it is more likely than not that we would sell or otherwise dispose of a long lived asset significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
residual risk our most significant asset impairment exposure  other than goodwill which is discussed below  relates to our landfills 
a significant reduction in our estimated disposal capacity as a result of unanticipated events such as regulatory developments  revocation of an existing permit or denial of an expansion permit  or changes in our assumptions used to calculate disposal capacity  could trigger an impairment charge 
recognition criteria 
if such circumstances arise  we recognize impairment for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset if the net book value of the asset exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
we generally use the present value of the expected cash flows from that asset to determine fair value 
goodwill recoverability we annually test goodwill for impairment at december or when an indicator of impairment exists 
we test goodwill for impairment using the two step process 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
we have defined our reporting units to be consistent with our operating segments east  central and west 
in determining fair value  we primarily use discounted future cash flows and operating results based on a comparative multiple of earnings or revenues 
significant estimates used in our fair value calculation using discounted future cash flows include estimates of future revenue and expense growth by reporting unit  which we estimate to range from to  future estimated effective tax rates  which we estimate to be  future estimated capital expenditures as well as future required investments in working capital  estimated discount rates  which we estimate to range between and  and the future terminal value of the reporting unit  which is based on its ability to exist into perpetuity 
significant estimates used in the fair value calculation using market value multiples include a estimated future growth potential of the reporting unit  b estimated multiples of revenue or earnings a willing buyer is likely to pay  and c estimated control premium a willing buyer is likely to pay 
in addition  we evaluate a reporting unit for impairment if events or circumstances change between annual tests  indicating a possible impairment 
examples of such events or circumstances include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion thereof will be sold  continued or sustained losses at a reporting unit  a significant decline in our market capitalization as compared to our book value  or the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within the reporting unit 
we assign assets and liabilities from our corporate operating segment to our three reporting units to the extent that such assets or liabilities relate to the cash flows of the reporting unit and would be included in determining the reporting unit s fair value 

table of contents in preparing our annual test for impairment as of december   we determined that our indicated fair value of total invested capital exceeded our total market capitalization 
we believe one of the primary reconciling differences between the indicated fair value of total invested capital and our total market capitalization is due to a control premium 
we believe the control premium represents the value a market participant could extract as savings and or synergies by obtaining control  and thereby eliminating duplicative overhead and operating costs resulting from the consolidation of routes and internalization of waste streams 
as of december   we determined that the indicated fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value by a range of approximately to and  therefore  we noted no indicators of impairment at our reporting units 
we will continuously monitor market trends in our business  the related expected cash flows and our calculation of market capitalization for purposes of identifying possible indicators of impairment 
if our book value per share exceeds our market price per share or if we have other indicators of impairment  we will be required to perform an interim step one impairment analysis  which may lead to a step two analysis and possible impairment of our goodwill 
additionally  we would then be required to review our remaining long lived assets for impairment 
our operating segments  which also represent our reporting units  are comprised of several vertically integrated businesses 
when an individual business within an integrated operating segment is divested  goodwill is allocated to that business based on its fair value relative to the fair value of its operating segment 
residual risks future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with acquired businesses is impaired 
the valuation of identifiable goodwill requires significant estimates and judgment about future performance  cash flows and fair value 
our future results could be affected if these current estimates of future performance and fair value change 
for example  a reduction in long term growth assumptions could reduce the estimated fair value of the operating segments to below their carrying values  which could trigger an impairment charge 
similarly  an increase in our discount rate could trigger an impairment charge 
any resulting impairment charge could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets other than non deductible goodwill and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the income tax rate in effect during the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making this determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce our provision for income taxes 
our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
we are subject to us federal income taxes and to the income taxes of numerous states 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the combined income tax expense 
regarding the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements  we record a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of income 
accrued interest and penalties are included within other accrued liabilities and deferred income taxes and other long term tax liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
residual risks income tax assets and liabilities established in purchase accounting for acquisitions are based on assumptions that could differ from the ultimate outcome of the tax matters 
such adjustments would be charged or credited to earnings  unless they meet certain remeasurement criteria and are allowed to be adjusted to goodwill 

table of contents changes in the estimated realizability of deferred tax assets could result in adjustments to our provision for income taxes 
valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and the realizability of net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes are based on our judgment 
if our judgments and estimates concerning valuation allowances and the realizability of net operating loss carryforwards are incorrect  our provision for income taxes would change 
we are currently under examination or administrative review by various state and federal taxing authorities for certain tax years 
the internal revenue code and income tax regulations are a complex set of rules that we must interpret and apply 
positions taken in tax years under examination or subsequent years are subject to challenge 
accordingly  we may have exposure for additional tax liabilities arising from these audits if any positions taken by us or by companies we have acquired are disallowed by the taxing authorities 
we adjust our liabilities for uncertain tax positions when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  their ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different from our current estimates of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to our provision for income taxes in the period in which they are determined 
defined benefit pension plans we currently have one qualified defined benefit pension plan  the bfi retirement plan the plan 
the plan covers certain employees in the united states  including some employees subject to collective bargaining agreements 
the plan s benefit formula is based on a percentage of compensation as defined in the plan document 
the benefits of approximately of the current plan participants were frozen upon allied s acquisition of bfi in our pension contributions are made in accordance with funding standards established by the employee retirement income security act of and the internal revenue code  as amended by the pension protection act of the plan s assets are invested as determined by our retirement benefits committee 
at december   the plan assets were invested in fixed income bond funds  equity funds and cash 
we annually review and adjust the plan s asset allocation as deemed necessary 
our unfunded benefit obligation for the plan was million as of december  compared to million as of december  residual risk changes in the plan s investment mix and performance of the equity and bond markets and fund managers could impact the amount of pension income or expense recorded  the funded status of the plan and the need for future cash contributions 
assumptions 
the benefit obligation and associated income or expense related to the plan are determined based on assumptions concerning items such as discount rates  expected rates of return and average rates of compensation increases 
our assumptions are reviewed annually and adjusted as deemed necessary 
we determine the discount rate based on a model which matches the timing and amount of expected benefit payments to maturities of high quality bonds priced as of the plan measurement date 
where that timing does not correspond to a published high quality bond rate  our model uses an expected yield curve to determine an appropriate current discount rate 
the yield on the bonds is used to derive a discount rate for the liability 
if the discount rate were to increase by  our benefit obligation would decrease by approximately million 
if the discount rate were to decrease by  our benefit obligation would increase by approximately million 
in developing our expected rate of return assumption  we evaluate long term expected and historical returns on the plan assets  giving consideration to our asset mix and the anticipated duration of the plan obligations 
the average rate of compensation increase reflects our expectations of average pay increases over the periods benefits are earned 
less than of participants in the plan continue to earn service benefits 
residual risks our assumed discount rate is sensitive to changes in market based interest rates 
a decrease in the discount rate will increase our related benefit plan obligation 

table of contents our annual pension expense would be impacted if the actual return on plan assets were to vary from the expected return

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our major market risk exposure of our financial instruments is changing interest rates in the united states and fluctuations in libor 
we intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
the carrying value of our variable rate debt approximates fair value because interest rates are variable and  accordingly  approximates current market rates for instruments with similar risk and maturities 
the fair value of our debt is determined as of the balance sheet date and is subject to change 
the table below provides information about certain of our market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forward looking statement 
expected maturity date thereafter total fair value as of december  fixed rate debt amount outstanding in millions average interest rates variable rate debt amount outstanding in millions average interest rates the fixed and variable rate debt amounts above exclude the remaining non cash discounts  premiums and adjustments to fair value recorded in purchase accounting totaling million 
fuel price risk fuel costs represent a significant operating expense 
when economically practical  we may enter into new or renew contracts  or engage in other strategies  to mitigate market risk 
where appropriate  we have implemented a fuel recovery fee that is designed to recover our fuel costs 
while we charge these fees to a majority of our customers  we are unable to charge such fees to all customers 
consequently  an increase in fuel costs results in an increase in our cost of operations  a smaller increase in our revenue from the fuel recovery fee and a decrease in our operating margin percentage 
conversely  a decrease in fuel costs results in a decrease in our cost of operations  a smaller decrease in our revenue and an increase in our operating margin percentage 
at current consumption levels  a twenty cent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately million on an annual basis 
offsetting these changes in fuel expense would be changes in our fuel recovery fee charged to our customers 
at current participation rates  a twenty cent change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel recovery fee by approximately million 
our operations also require the use of certain petrochemical based products such as liners at our landfills whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals 
an increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products  which would increase our operating and capital costs 
we also are susceptible to increases in indirect fuel recovery fees from our vendors 
commodities prices we market recycled products such as cardboard and newspaper from our recycling centers 
market demand for recyclable materials causes volatility in commodity prices 
at current volumes and mix of materials  we believe a ten dollar per ton change in the price of recyclable materials will change annual revenue and operating income by approximately million and million  respectively  on an annual basis 
revenue from sales of these products in  and was approximately million  million and million  respectively
