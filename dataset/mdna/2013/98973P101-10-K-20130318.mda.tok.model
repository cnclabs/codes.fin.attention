business overview ziopharm oncology  inc is a biopharmaceutical company that seeks to develop and commercialize a diverse portfolio of cancer drugs that can address unmet medical needs through the licensing and development of proprietary small molecule drug candidates and the synthetic biology platform 
our small molecule drug candidates are related to cancer therapeutics already on the market or in development and that can be administered by intravenous  or iv  and or oral dosing 
our small molecule clinical programs include palifosfamide zio  indibulin zio and darinaparsin zio 
we are also pursuing the development of our synthetic biology platform in the field of cancer pursuant to a partnering arrangement with intrexon corporation  or intrexon 
under the arrangement  we obtained rights to intrexon s effector platform for use in the field of oncology  which includes two existing clinical stage product candidates  zin cti or dc rts il al and zin ati or ad rts il al 
we plan to leverage intrexon s synthetic biology platform to develop products to stimulate key pathways used by the body s immune system to inhibit the growth and metastasis of cancers  adding significantly to our small molecule drug development portfolio and utilizing 
table of contents our capabilities to translate science to the patient setting 
more detailed descriptions of palifosfamide  indibulin  darinaparsin  zin cti and zin ati  and our clinical development plans for each  are set forth in this report under the caption business product candidates 
development plans we are currently pursuing several clinical programs for our small molecule and synthetic biology candidates  which include palifosfamide zio completing our phase pivotal trial in first line metastatic sts  entitled picasso  and continuing enrollment in our phase trial in sclc  entitled matisse 
zin cti completing a phase b trial in patients with metastatic melanoma 
zin ati completing a phase b trial in patients with late stage melanoma  continuing enrollment in our phase trial in patients with late stage melanoma and enrolling a phase trial of zin ati and palifosfamide for breast cancer 
indibulin zio completing a phase trial in patients with metastatic breast cancer 
darinaparsin zio working with solasia in the licensed territory  assessing future oral iv opportunities 
we are also evaluating additional potential preclinical candidates and continuing discovery efforts aimed at identifying other potential product candidates under our channel agreement with intrexon 
our current plans involve using our principal internal financial resources to develop palifosfamide and to extend the synthetic biology program  with the intention of ultimately partnering or otherwise raising additional resources to support further development activities for all of our product candidates 
based on these plans  we expect to incur the following expenses during the next twelve months approximately million on research and development expenses and approximately million on general corporate and administrative expenses 
as of december   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents 
this forecast of expenses is forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties  and the actual amount of our expenses over the next twelve months could vary materially and adversely as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed in the risk factors section of this report and the uncertainties applicable to our forecast for the overall sufficiency of our capital resources  which are discussed under liquidity and capital resources below 
we have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and our expenses could prove to be significantly higher than we currently anticipate 
furthermore  the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
product development costs and timelines can vary significantly for each product candidate  are difficult to accurately predict  and will require us to obtain additional funding  either alone or in connection with partnering arrangements 
various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping and marketing of each product 
the lengthy process of seeking approval and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could materially  adversely affect our business 
to date  we have not received approval for the sale of any product candidates in any market and  therefore  have not generated any revenues from our product candidates 
financial overview overview of results of operations revenue 
we recognize research and development funding revenue over the estimated period of performance 
we have not generated product revenues since our inception 
unless and until we receive approval from the fda and or other regulatory authorities for our product candidates  we cannot sell our products and will not have product revenues 

table of contents research and development expenses 
our research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  costs of contract manufacturing services  costs of facilities and equipment  fees paid to professional service providers in conjunction with our clinical trials  fees paid to research organizations in conjunction with pre clinical animal studies  costs of materials used in research and development  consulting  license and milestone payments and sponsored research fees paid to third parties 
we have not accumulated and tracked our internal historical research and development costs or our personnel and personnel related costs on a program by program basis 
our employee and infrastructure resources are allocated across several projects  and many of our costs are directed to broadly applicable research endeavors 
as a result  we cannot state the costs incurred for each of our oncology programs on a program by program basis 
in  our clinical projects consisted primarily of two phase projects for our lead product candidate  palifosfamide 
the expenses for our phase palifosfamide study in sts incurred by us to third parties were million for the year ended december   and million from the project inception in july through december  the expenses for our phase palifosfamide study in sclc incurred by us to third parties were million for the year ended december   and million from the project inception in december through december  our future research and development expenses in support of our current and future programs will be subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion 
we test potential products in numerous pre clinical studies for safety  toxicology and efficacy 
we may conduct multiple clinical trials for each product 
as we obtain results from trials  we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain products in order to focus our resources on more promising products or indications 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  and the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product 
it is not unusual for pre clinical and clinical development of each of these types of products to require the expenditure of substantial resources 
we estimate that clinical trials of the type generally needed to secure new drug approval are typically completed over the following timelines clinical phase estimated completion period phase i years phase ii years phase iii years the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during clinical development  including  among others  the following the number of clinical sites included in the trials  the length of time required to enroll suitable patents  the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trials  the duration of patient follow up to ensure the absence of long term product related adverse events  and the efficacy and safety profile of the product 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our programs or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product 
our inability to complete our programs in a timely manner or our failure to enter into appropriate 
table of contents collaborative agreements could significantly increase our capital requirements and could inversely impact our liquidity 
these uncertainties could force us to seek additional  external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our product development strategy 
our ability to raise additional capital  or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us  would jeopardize the future success of our business 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and stock based compensation  consulting and professional fees  including patent related costs  general corporate costs and facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses or cost of product revenue 
other income expense 
other income expense consists primarily of changes in the fair value of warrants 
results of operations for the fiscal year ended december  versus december  revenues 
revenues for the years ended december  and were as follows year ended december  change in thousands collaboration revenue revenue for the year ended december  increased by million from the year ended december  the increase was due to our receipt of funds under our collaboration agreement with solasia to further the research and development of darinaparsin 
we recognize the research and development funding revenue relating to this collaboration agreement in equal monthly amounts over the estimated period of performance of months commencing march research and development expenses 
research and development expenses during the years ended december  and were as follows year ended december  change in thousands research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased by million from the year ended december  the increase was due to the following changes since higher trial costs of million related to the phase palifosfamide study in sclc  which started in  increased preclinical trial costs of million due to additional studies needed to assist in nda filing preparation  other clinical costs of million  manufacturing activity costs of million needed to support existing trials and further development of drugs  a million increase in non cash expense related to our channel agreement over  salary and employee related costs of million due to increased headcount to support increases in research and development activities discussed above  and million related to a new safety database  offset by other cost reductions of million 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase  as compared to prior periods  as we continue our pivotal phase study of palifosfamide and other studies for palifosfamide  dna therapeutics  indibulin and darinaparsin 

table of contents general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses during the years ended december  and were as follows year ended december  change in thousands general and administrative general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased by million from the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to higher salary and higher employee related costs of million to support increased activity in clinical studies  non employee contracted costs of million  costs of million related to our restructuring and other costs of million 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase moderately to support increased activity in clinical studies 
other income expense 
other income expense during the years ended december  and were as follows year ended december  change in thousands other income  net change in fair value of warrants total the decrease in other income expense from the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was due primarily to the change in the fair value of liability classified warrants  which yielded a gain of  thousand in as compared to a gain of  thousand in the change in liability classified warrants is attributable to the decrease in our stock price  decrease in remaining term and a decrease in volatility 
additional changes are attributable to increased state tax refunds and decreased interest rates on invested funds 
results of operations for the fiscal year ended december  versus december  revenues 
revenues for the years ended december  and were as follows year ended december  change in thousands collaboration revenue revenue for the year ended december  increased by million from the year ended december  the increase was due to our receipt of funds under our collaboration agreement with solasia to further the research and development of darinaparsin 
we recognize the research and development funding revenue relating to this collaboration agreement in equal monthly amounts over the estimated period of performance of months commencing march 
table of contents research and development expenses 
research and development expenses during the years ended december  and were as follows year ended december  change in thousands research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased by million from the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to a one time million non cash expense related to our channel partnership arrangement with intrexon  including our associated license of intrexon technology  along with increased clinical costs of million  of which million related to the phase palifosfamide study  million related to dna based therapeutics projects and million related to other clinical trials  increased preclinical costs of million  increased manufacturing activity of million to replenish drug supplies and further develop palifosfamide  increased salary and employee related costs of million resulting from additional headcount and other costs of million 
exclusive of the one time million non cash expense related to our channel partnership arrangement with intrexon  we expect our research and development expenses to increase  as compared to prior periods  as we continue our pivotal phase study of palifosfamide and other studies for palifosfamide  dna therapeutics  indibulin and darinaparsin 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses during the years ended december  and were as follows year ended december  change in thousands general and administrative general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased by million from the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased consulting fees of million and increased salary and employee related costs of million  offset by certain cost reductions of million 
the increased general and administrative activity was related to increased support for clinical studies 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase moderately to support increased activity in clinical studies 
other income expense 
other income expense during the years ended december  and were as follows year ended december  change in thousands other income  net change in fair value of warrants total the increase in other income expense from the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was due primarily to the change in the fair value of liability classified warrants  which 
table of contents yielded a gain of  thousand in as compared to a loss of  thousand in the change in liability classified warrants is attributable to the decrease in our stock price  decrease in remaining term and a decrease in volatility 
additional changes are attributable to increased state tax refunds and decreased interest rates on invested funds 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  compared to million in cash and cash equivalents as of december  we anticipate that our cash resources will be sufficient to fund our operations into the second half of as a result  our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in their report on our financial statements 
the results from the company s picasso pivotal trial in first line sts are expected in the last week of march the company has various dilutive and non dilutive funding alternatives if the results are positive 
if the results are negative  alternative cost cutting efficiencies are planned in an attempt to extend our cash resources as long as possible  though there are no assurances that such efforts  if necessary  would be realized 
in addition  changes may occur that would consume our existing capital prior to the second half of  including expansion of the scope of  and or slower than expected progress of  our research and development efforts and changes in governmental regulation 
actual costs may ultimately vary from our current expectations  which could materially impact our use of capital and our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations 
we have estimated the sufficiency of our cash resources based in part on the trial design for our picasso pivotal trial in first line sts and our adaptive phase trial in first line sclc for iv palifosfamide and our current timing expectations for the results of the picasso pivotal trial and enrollment in our adaptive phase trial in first line sclc for iv palifosfamide  which may change based on the progression of enrollment 
we also assumed responsibility for the advancement of two product candidates in the clinic under our channel agreement with intrexon  and we expect that the costs associated with these and additional product candidates will increase the level of our overall research and development expenses significantly going forward 
although our forecasts for expenses and the sufficiency of our capital resources takes into account our plans to develop the intrexon products  we assumed development responsibility for these products on january   and the actual costs associated therewith may be significantly in excess of forecasted amounts 
although all human clinical trials are expensive and difficult to design and implement  we believe that due to complexity  costs associated with clinical trials for synthetic biology products are greater than the corresponding costs associated with clinical trials for small molecule candidates 
in addition to increased research and development costs  we have added  and will continue to add  headcount to support our exclusive channel partnership endeavors  which will add to our general and administrative expenses going forward 
in addition to these factors  our actual cash requirements may vary materially from our current expectations for a number of other factors that may include  but are not limited to  changes in the focus and direction of our development programs  competitive and technical advances  costs associated with the development of our product candidates  our ability to secure partnering arrangements  and costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing our intellectual property rights 
if we exhaust our capital reserves more quickly than anticipated  regardless of the reason  and we are unable to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all  we will be unable to proceed with development of some or all of our product candidates on expected timelines and will be forced to prioritize among them 
we expect that we will need additional financing to support our long term plans for clinical trials and new product development 
we expect to finance our cash needs through the sale of equity securities  strategic collaborations and or debt financings  or through other sources that may be dilutive to existing stockholders 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain funding from any of these sources or  if obtained  what the terms of such funding s may be  or that any amount that we are able to obtain will be adequate to support our working capital requirements until we achieve profitable operations 
we have no current committed sources of additional capital 
recently  capital markets have experienced a period of instability that may severely hinder our ability to raise capital within the time periods needed or on terms we consider acceptable  if at all 
if we are 
table of contents unable to raise additional funds when needed  we may not be able to continue development and regulatory approval of our products  or we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all our research and development programs 
recent financing transactions january public offering on january   we entered into an underwriting agreement with j 
p 
morgan securities llc  as representative of the several underwriters named therein  relating to the issuance and sale of  shares of our common stock 
the price to the public in the offering was per share  and the underwriters agreed to purchase the shares from us pursuant to the underwriting agreement at a purchase price of per share 
under the terms of the underwriting agreement  we also granted the underwriters an option  exercisable for days  to purchase up to an additional  shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share 
the offering was made pursuant to our effective registration statement on form s registration statement no 
previously filed with the sec  and a prospectus supplement thereunder 
the underwriters purchased the  shares on january  and purchased an additional  shares on january  pursuant to the partial exercise of their option to purchase additional shares  resulting in our issuing a total of  shares 
the net proceeds from the offering were approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by us 
cash increases and decreases the following table summarizes our net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december   and and the period from september  date of inception through december  year ended december  period from september  date of inception through december  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase was due to an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets attributable to a related party prepayment see note to the financial statements  related party transactions  as well as an increase in the net loss from operations  caused by increased research and development activities  excluding non cash expenses of the change in fair value of warrants  stock based compensation  and in process research and development 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase was primarily due to an increase in the net loss from operations  caused by increased research and development activities relating to the palifosfamide pivotal trial 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was due to the build out of additional space in our boston and new york offices including leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures along with software additions 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  
table of contents the change is primarily attributable to a million financing that occurred during the year ended december  versus a million financing and warrant exercises of million that occurred during the year ended december  there was also a million financing during the year ended december  operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we anticipate that losses will continue for the foreseeable future 
at december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
our actual cash requirements may vary materially from those planned because of a number of factors including changes in the focus  direction and pace of our development programs  competitive and technical advances  costs associated with the development of our product candidates  our ability to secure partnering arrangements  costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and any other intellectual property rights  or other developments  and other matters identified under part ii item a

working capital as of december  was million  consisting of million in current assets and million in current liabilities 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our outstanding obligations as of december  and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating leases royalty and license fees contract milestone payments total our commitments for operating leases relate to the lease for our corporate headquarters in new york  new york  our operations center in boston  massachusetts and our office in germantown  md  which was closed on july  our commitments for royalty and license fees relate to our patent agreement with baxter healthcare corporation and our royalty agreements with southern research institute and baxter healthcare corporation requiring minimum royalty payments 
the contract milestone payments relate to our cro agreements with ppd development  lp  pharmaceutical research associates  inc  and novella clinical  inc the timing of the remaining contract milestone payments are dependent upon factors that are beyond our control  including our ability to recruit patients  the outcome of future clinical trials and any requirements imposed on our clinical trials by regulatory agencies 
however  for the purpose of the above table  we have assumed that the payment of the milestones will occur within five years of december  see note to the financial statements  commitments and contingencies 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in 
table of contents the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following are our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements clinical trial expenses  fair value measurements of stock based compensation and warrants  and income taxes 
clinical trial expenses clinical trial expenses include expenses associated with cros 
the invoicing from cros for services rendered can lag several months 
we accrue the cost of services rendered in connection with cro activities based on our estimate of site management  monitoring costs  and project management costs 
we maintain regular communication with our cros to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates 
differences between actual clinical trial expenses and estimated clinical trial expenses recorded have not been material and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
fair value measurements of stock based compensation and warrants accounting standards define fair value  establish a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhance disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  that may be used to measure fair value which are the following level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
we make certain assumptions in order to value and expense our share based compensation awards and liability classified warrants 
in connection with valuing stock options and liability classified warrants we use the black scholes model and the binomial model  respectively  which require us to estimate certain subjective assumptions 
the key assumptions we make are the expected volatility of our stock  the expected term of the award  and the expected forfeiture rate related to share based awards 
in connection with our restricted stock programs  we make assumptions principally related to the forfeiture rate 
the key assumptions used to estimate fair value for our warrants include current and expected stock prices  volatility  dividends  forward yield curves and discount rates 
we review our valuation assumptions periodically and  as a result  we may change our valuation assumptions used to value share based awards granted in future periods and warrants 
such changes may lead to a significant change in the expense we recognize in connection with share based payments and warrants 

table of contents income taxes in preparing our financial statements  we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which  prior to the consideration for the need for a valuation allowance  are included on the balance sheet 
significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in performing this assessment  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
in making this determination  under the applicable financial accounting standards  we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and the effects of tax planning strategies 
our estimates of future taxable income include  among other items  our estimates of future income tax deductions related to the exercise of stock options 
in the event that actual results differ from our estimates  we adjust our estimates in future periods and we may need to establish a valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
we account for uncertain tax positions using a more likely than not threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions 
the evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors that include  but are not limited to  changes in tax law  the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns  the effective settlement of matters subject to audit  new audit activity and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position 
we evaluate uncertain tax positions on an annual basis and adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions 
our liabilities for uncertain tax positions can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations  the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the more likely than not threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the examination process 
we consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures  including all appeals and administrative reviews  we have no plans to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position  and we believe that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would examine or re examine the related tax position 
we also accrue for potential interest and penalties  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  we adopted accounting standards update  or asu no 
 improving disclosures about fair value measurements which requires additional disclosure about the amounts of and reasons for significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements 
in addition  effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   this standard further requires an entity to present disaggregated information about activity in level fair value measurements on a gross basis  rather than as one net amount 
as this accounting standard only requires enhanced disclosure  the adoption of this newly issued accounting standard did not impact our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued asu no 
 fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
this newly issued accounting standard clarifies the application of certain existing fair value measurement guidance and expands the disclosures for fair value measurements that are estimated using significant unobservable level inputs 
this asu is effective on a prospective basis for annual and interim reporting periods beginning on or after december   which for us is january  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
this newly issued accounting standard eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity  
table of contents requires the consecutive presentation of the statement of net income and other comprehensive income  and requires an entity to present reclassification adjustments on the face of the financial statements from other comprehensive income to net income 
the amendments in this asu do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income nor do the amendments affect how earnings per share is calculated or presented 
this asu is required to be applied retrospectively and is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december  as this accounting standard only requires enhanced disclosure  the adoption of this standard did not impact our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update  or asu  no 
balance sheet topic disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities which requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
this update is effective for periods beginning after january  the adoption of this standard will not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we currently do not have any special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to our cash 
the goals of our investment policy are preservation of capital  fulfillment of liquidity needs and fiduciary control of cash and investments 
we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
to achieve our goals  we maintain our cash in interest bearing cash accounts 
as all of our investments are cash deposits in a global bank  it is subject to minimal interest rate risk 
effect of currency exchange rates and exchange rate risk management we conduct clinical studies outside of the united states primarily in western europe 
these business operations are not material at this time  therefore any currency fluctuations will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
