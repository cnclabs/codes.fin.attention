the terms of the transaction are expected to be finalized and the transaction closed during the expected divestiture of our remaining ready mix concrete operations has been accounted for and reported as a discontinued operation and  accordingly  historical amounts previously reported have been adjusted  where appropriate  to remove the effect of discontinued operations 
further  assets and liabilities related to the discontinued operations have been classified as assets liabilities held for sale and discontinued operations 
table of contents in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
through our discontinued ready mix concrete operations  we are a supplier of ready mix concrete in certain areas of texas and southwest arkansas 
our customers for concrete include contractors and subcontractors for residential  commercial  and highway construction projects 
we compete with ready mix concrete producers and aggregate producers located in the regions where we operate

through wholly owned subsidiaries  our energy equipment group manufactures structural wind towers  containers and tank heads for pressure and non pressure vessels  and utility  traffic  and lighting structures 
our structural wind towers business is a leading manufacturer in north america of structural wind towers used in the wind energy market 
these towers are manufactured in the us and mexico to customer specifications and installed by our customers 
our customers are generally wind turbine producers 
our structural wind towers backlog as of december  was approximately million 
approximately million of this backlog is involved in litigation filed by the company against one of our structural wind tower customers for breach of contract by failing to comply with the customer multi year  contractual purchase obligations

there is strong competition in the tank heads business 
we manufacture utility  traffic  and lighting structures  which are used principally by municipalities  and various other local and state governmental entities 
we also manufacture transmission and distribution structures to be used in the erection of private and public electric transmission lines 
these structures are manufactured in the us and mexico to customer specifications and installed by our customers 
there are a number of well established entities that actively compete with us in the business of manufacturing energy equipment including several domestic and foreign manufacturers of structural wind towers for the north american market 
inland barge group 
through wholly owned subsidiaries  our inland barge group is a leading us manufacturer of inland barges and fiberglass barge covers 
we manufacture a variety of dry cargo barges  such as deck barges  and open or covered hopper barges that transport various commodities  such as grain  coal  and aggregates 
we also manufacture tank barges used to transport liquids such as crude oil  chemicals and a variety of petroleum products 
our fiberglass reinforced lift covers are used primarily for grain barges 
our four barge manufacturing facilities are located along the us inland river systems  allowing for rapid delivery to our customers 
our inland barge group backlog as of december  was approximately million 
our primary inland barge customers are commercial marine transportation companies 
many companies have the capability to enter into  and from time to time do enter into  the inland barge manufacturing business 
we strive to compete through operational efficiency  timely delivery  and quality products 
all other 
all other includes our captive insurance and transportation companies  legal  environmental  and maintenance costs associated with non operating facilities  other peripheral businesses  and the change in market valuation related to ineffective commodity hedges 
foreign operations 
trinity foreign operations are primarily located in mexico 
continuing operations included sales to foreign customers  primarily in mexico  which represented   and of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively 
as of december  and  we had and  respectively  of our long lived assets not held for sale located outside the us 
table of contents we manufacture railcars  containers  tank heads  structural wind towers  utility structures  parts and steel components  and other products at our mexico facilities for local consumption as well as for export to the us and other countries 
any material change in the quotas  regulations  or duties on imports imposed by the us government and its agencies or on exports imposed by the government of mexico or its agencies could adversely affect our operations in mexico 
our foreign activities are also subject to various other risks of doing business in foreign countries  including currency fluctuations  political changes  changes in laws and regulations  social unrest  unrestrained criminal activities  and economic instability 
although our operations have not been materially affected by any of these factors to date  any substantial disruption of business as it is currently conducted could adversely affect our operations at least in the short term 
backlog 
as of december  and  our backlog was approximately as follows december  december  in millions rail group external customers leasing group inland barge structural wind towers for the twelve months ended december   the company received orders for  railcars 
the increase in backlog as of december  reflects the value of orders taken during the year as well as contractual pricing adjustments on long term orders previously received 
the total amount of orders in our backlog from the leasing group was supported by lease commitments with external customers 
the final amount dedicated to the leasing group may vary by the time of delivery 
approximately of our railcar backlog is expected to be delivered in the twelve months ending december  with the remainder to be delivered from through approximately of our backlog for barges is expected to be delivered in the twelve months ending december  with the remainder to be delivered in for multi year barge orders  deliveries for and are included in the backlog at this time where specific production quantities for future years have been determined 
approximately million of the backlog for structural wind towers is involved in litigation filed by the company against one of our structural wind tower customers for the customer breach of a long term supply contract for the manufacture of towers 
approximately of our backlog for structural wind towers not currently subject to current litigation is expected to be delivered in with the remainder contracted for delivery in future years 
marketing 
we sell substantially all of our products and services through our own sales personnel operating from offices in multiple locations in the us as well as canada  mexico  the united kingdom  singapore  and sweden 
we also use independent sales representatives on a limited basis 
raw materials and suppliers 
railcar specialty components and steel 
products manufactured at our railcar manufacturing facilities require a significant supply of raw materials such as steel  as well as numerous specialty components such as brakes  wheels  axles  side frames  bolsters  and bearings 
specialty components and steel purchased from third parties comprise approximately of the production cost of each railcar 
although the number of alternative suppliers of specialty components has declined in recent years  at least two suppliers continue to produce most components 
however  any unanticipated interruption in the supply chain of specialty components would have an impact on both our margins and production schedules 
the principal material used in our manufacturing segments is steel 
during  the supply of steel was sufficient to support our manufacturing requirements 
market steel prices continue to exhibit short periods of volatility and ended lower than steel prices may continue to be volatile in part as a result of scrap surcharges assessed by steel mills and other market factors 
we often use contract specific purchasing practices  existing supplier commitments  contractual price escalation provisions  and other arrangements with our customers  to mitigate the effect of this volatility on our operating profits for the year 
in general  we believe there is enough capacity in the supply industry to meet current production levels 
we believe the existing contracts and other relationships we have in place will meet our current production forecasts 
however  any unanticipated interruption in our supply chain could have an adverse impact on both our margins and production schedules 
aggregates 
aggregates can be found throughout the us  and many producers exist nationwide 
however  as a general rule  shipments from an individual quarry are limited in geographic scope because the cost of transporting processed aggregates to 
table of contents customers is high in relation to the value of the product itself 
we operate mining facilities strategically located in texas  arkansas  and louisiana to fulfill some of our needs for aggregates 
cement 
cement required for our ready mix concrete operations is received primarily from texas 
in  the supply of cement was sufficient in our markets to meet demand 
we have not experienced difficulties supplying concrete to our customers 
employees 
the following table presents the approximate headcount breakdown of employees by business group business group december  rail group construction products group inland barge group energy equipment group railcar leasing and management services group all other corporate as of december   approximately  employees were employed in the us and approximately  employees were employed in mexico 
acquisitions and divestitures 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
environmental matters 
we are subject to comprehensive federal  state  local  and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the release or discharge of materials into the environment  the management  use  processing  handling  storage  transport  and disposal of hazardous and non hazardous waste and materials  and other activities relating to the protection of human health and the environment 
such laws and regulations not only expose us to liability for our own acts  but also may expose us to liability for the acts of others or for our actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such actions may have been taken 
in addition  such laws may require significant expenditures to achieve compliance  and are frequently modified or revised to impose new obligations 
civil and criminal fines and penalties may be imposed for non compliance with these environmental laws and regulations 
our operations that involve hazardous materials also raise potential risks of liability under common law 
environmental operating permits are  or may be  required for our operations under these laws and regulations 
these operating permits are subject to modification  renewal  and revocation 
we regularly monitor and review our operations  procedures  and policies for compliance with our operating permits and related laws and regulations 
despite these compliance efforts  risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of our businesses  as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 
we believe that our operations and facilities  whether owned  managed  or leased  are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that any non compliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 
however  future events  such as changes in  or modified interpretations of  existing environmental laws and regulations or enforcement policies  or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards associated with our products  business activities  or properties  may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
in addition to environmental laws  the transportation of commodities by railcar or barge raises potential risks in the event of a derailment  spill  or other accident 
generally  liability under existing law in the us for a derailment  spill  or other accident depends on the negligence of the party  such as the railroad  the shipper  or the manufacturer of the barge  railcar  or its components 
however  under certain circumstances strict liability concepts may apply 
governmental regulation 
railcar industry 
the primary regulatory and industry authorities involved in the regulation of the railcar industry are the us environmental protection agency  the research and special programs administration and the federal railroad administration  both divisions of the us department of transportation  and the association of american railroads 
these organizations establish rules and regulations for the railcar industry and rail interchange  including construction specifications and standards for the design and manufacture of railcars and railcar parts  mechanical  maintenance  and related 
table of contents standards for railcars  safety of railroad equipment  tracks  and operations  and packaging and transportation of hazardous or toxic materials 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with these regulations 
we cannot predict whether any future changes in these rules and regulations could cause added compliance costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operations 
inland barge industry 
the primary regulatory and industry authorities involved in the regulation of the inland barge industry are the us coast guard  the us national transportation safety board  the us customs service  the maritime administration of the us department of transportation  and private industry organizations such as the american bureau of shipping 
these organizations establish safety criteria  investigate vessel accidents  and recommend improved safety standards 
violations of these laws and related regulations can result in substantial civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctions curtailing operations 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
we cannot predict whether future changes that affect compliance costs would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
highway products 
the primary regulatory and industry authorities involved in the regulation of highway products manufacturers are the us department of transportation  the federal highway administration  and various state highway departments 
these organizations establish certain standards and specifications related to the manufacture of our highway products 
if our products were found not to be in compliance with these standards and specifications  we would be required to re qualify our products for installation on state and national highways 
we believe that our highway products are in substantial compliance with all applicable standards and specifications 
we cannot predict whether future changes in these standards and specifications would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
occupational safety and health administration and similar regulations 
our operations are subject to regulation of health and safety matters by the us occupational safety and health administration and the us mine safety and health administration 
we believe that we employ appropriate precautions to protect our employees and others from workplace injuries and harmful exposure to materials handled and managed at our facilities 
however  claims that may be asserted against us for work related illnesses or injury and the further adoption of occupational and mine safety and health regulations in the us or in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate could increase our operating costs 
while we do not anticipate having to make material expenditures in order to remain in substantial compliance with health and safety laws and regulations  we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will not become involved in future litigation or other proceedings or if we were found to be responsible or liable in any litigation or proceeding  that such costs would not be material to us 
other matters 
to date  we have not suffered any material shortages with respect to obtaining sufficient energy supplies to operate our various plant facilities or transportation vehicles 
future limitations on the availability or consumption of petroleum products  particularly natural gas for plant operations and diesel fuel for vehicles  could have a material adverse effect upon our ability to conduct our business 
the likelihood of such an occurrence or its duration  and its ultimate effect on our operations  cannot be reasonably predicted at this time

item a 
risk factors 
there are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those mentioned in forward looking statements that we make from time to time in filings with the securities and exchange commission sec  news releases  reports  proxy statements  registration statements  and other written communications  as well as oral forward looking statements made from time to time by representatives of our company 
all known material risks and uncertainties are described below 
the cautionary statements below discuss important factors that could cause our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flows to be materially adversely affected 
accordingly  readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward looking statements contained herein 
we undertake no obligations to update or revise publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
volatility in the global financial markets may adversely affect our business and operating results 
during periods of volatility in the global financial markets  certain of our customers could delay or otherwise reduce their purchases of railcars  barges  wind towers  and other products and services 
if volatile conditions in the global credit markets prevent our customers access to credit  product order volumes may decrease or customers may default on payments owed to us 
likewise  if our suppliers face challenges obtaining credit  selling their products  or otherwise operating their businesses  the supply of materials we purchase from them to manufacture our products may be interrupted 
any of these conditions or events could result in reductions in our revenues  increased price competition  or increased operating costs  which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 
our backlog is not necessarily indicative of the level of our future revenues 
our backlog represents future production and estimated potential revenue attributable to firm contracts with  or written orders from  our customers for delivery in various periods 
instability in the global economy  negative conditions in the global credit markets  volatility in the industries that our products serve  changes in legislative policy  adverse changes in the financial condition of our customers for manufactured or leased products  adverse changes in the availability of raw materials and supplies  or un remedied contract breaches could possibly lead to contract termination or cancellations of orders in our backlog or requests for deferred deliveries of our backlog orders  each of which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations 
the cyclical nature of our business results in lower revenues during economic downturns 
we operate in cyclical industries 
downturns in overall economic conditions usually have a significant adverse effect on cyclical industries due to decreased demand for new and replacement products 
decreased demand could result in lower sales volumes  lower prices  and or a loss of profits 
the railcar  barge  and wind energy industries have previously experienced sharp cyclical downturns and at such times operated with a minimal backlog 
litigation claims could increase our costs and weaken our financial condition 
we are currently  and may from time to time be  involved in various claims or legal proceedings arising out of our operations 
adverse outcomes in some or all of these matters could result in judgments against us for significant monetary damages that could increase our costs and weaken our financial condition 
although we maintain reserves for our reasonably estimable liability  our reserves may be inadequate to cover the uninsured portion of claims or judgments 
any such claims or judgments could have a material adverse effect on our business  operations  or overall financial condition 
increases in the price and demand for steel could lower our margins and profitability 
the principal material used in our manufacturing segments is steel 
market steel prices continue to exhibit short periods of volatility 
steel prices may experience further volatility as a result of scrap surcharges assessed by steel mills and other market factors 
we often use contract specific purchasing practices  existing supplier commitments  contractual price escalation provisions  and other arrangements with our customers to mitigate the effect of this volatility on our operating profits for the year 
to the extent that we do not have such arrangements in place  an increase in steel prices could materially lower our margins and profitability 
in addition  our ability to meet production demands is dependent on the ability to obtain a sufficient amount of steel 
an unanticipated interruption in our supply chain could have an adverse impact on both our margins and production schedules 
we have potential exposure to environmental liabilities  which may increase costs and lower profitability 
we are subject to comprehensive federal  state  local  and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to i the release or discharge of materials into the environment  ii the management  use  processing  handling  storage  transport  and disposal of hazardous and non hazardous waste and materials  and iii other activities relating to the protection of human health and the environment 
such laws and regulations not only expose us to liability for our own acts  but also may expose us to liability for the acts of others or for our actions which were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time these actions were taken 
in addition  such laws may 
table of contents require significant expenditures to achieve compliance  and are frequently modified or revised to impose new obligations 
civil and criminal fines and penalties may be imposed for non compliance with these environmental laws and regulations 
our operations that involve hazardous materials also raise potential risks of liability under common law 
environmental operating permits are  or may be  required for our operations under these laws and regulations 
these operating permits are subject to modification  renewal  and revocation 
although we regularly monitor and review our operations  procedures  and policies for compliance with our operating permits and related laws and regulations  the risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of our businesses  as it is with other companies operating under environmental permits 
however  future events  such as changes in  or modified interpretations of  existing environmental laws and regulations or enforcement policies  or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards associated with our products  business activities  or properties  may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
in addition to environmental laws  the transportation of commodities by railcar or barge raises potential risks in the event of a derailment or other accident that results in the release of an environmentally sensitive substance 
generally  liability under existing law in the us for a derailment or other accident depends on the negligence  if any  of a party  such as the railroad  the shipper  or the manufacturer of the barge  railcar  or its components 
however  under certain circumstances strict liability concepts may apply and if we are found liable in any such incident  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  business  and operations 
we operate in highly competitive industries 
we may not be able to sustain our market leadership positions which may impact our financial results 
we face aggressive competition in all geographic markets and each industry sector in which we operate 
in addition to price  we face competition in product performance and technological innovation  quality  reliability of delivery  customer service  and other factors 
this competition is often intense  the effects of which could reduce our revenues and operating profits  limit our ability to grow  increase pricing pressure on our products  and otherwise affect our financial results 
the limited number of customers in certain of our businesses  the variable purchase patterns of our customers in all our segments  and the timing of completion  delivery  and customer acceptance of orders may cause our revenues and income from operations to vary substantially each quarter  which would result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly results 
some of the markets we serve are dominated by a limited number of customers 
customers in each of our business segments do not purchase a similar volume of products each year nor make purchases consistently from year to year 
as a result  the order levels for our products have varied significantly from quarterly period to quarterly period in the past and may continue to vary significantly in the future 
therefore  our results of operations in any particular quarterly period may be significantly affected 
as a result of these quarterly fluctuations  we believe that comparisons of our sales and operating results between quarterly periods may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
we may not have access to capital due to deterioration of conditions in the global capital markets  weakening of macroeconomic conditions  and negative changes in credit ratings 
in general  the company  and more specifically its leasing subsidiaries operations  rely in large part  upon banks and capital markets to fund its operations and contractual commitments and refinance existing debt 
these markets can experience high levels of volatility and access to capital can be constrained for an extended period of time 
in addition to conditions in the capital markets  a number of other factors could cause the company to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for both secured and unsecured debt 
these factors include the company financial performance and its credit ratings and rating outlook as determined primarily by rating agencies such as standard poor and moody investor service 
if the company is unable to secure financing on acceptable terms  the company other sources of funds  including available cash  bank facilities  and cash flow from operations may not be adequate to fund its operations and contractual commitments and refinance existing debt 
we may be unable to re market railcars from expiring leases on favorable terms  which could result in lower lease utilization percentages and reduced revenues 
the profitability of our railcar leasing business is dependent in part on our ability to re lease or sell railcars we own upon the expiration of existing lease terms  or upon lease defaults or bankruptcy filings by third party lessees 
our ability to re lease or sell leased railcars profitably is dependent upon several factors  including  among others the cost of and demand for leases or ownership of newer or specific use models  the availability in the market generally of other used or new railcars  the degree of obsolescence of leased railcars  the prevailing market and economic conditions  including the availability of credit  interest rates  and inflation rates  
table of contents the demand for refurbishment  the cost of materials and labor  the volume of railcar traffic  and the volume and nature of railcar loadings 
a downturn in the industries in which our lessees operate and decreased demand for railcars could also increase our exposure to re marketing risk because lessees may demand shorter lease terms or newer railcars  requiring us to re market leased railcars more frequently 
furthermore  the resale market for previously leased railcars has a limited number of potential buyers 
our inability to re lease or sell leased railcars on favorable terms could result in lower lease rates  lower lease utilization percentages  and reduced revenues 
fluctuations in the price and supply of specialty and other component parts used in the production of our products could have a material adverse effect on our ability to cost effectively manufacture and sell our products 
in some instances  we rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain components needed in our production 
a significant portion of our business depends on the adequate supply of numerous specialty and other parts and components at competitive prices such as brakes  wheels  side frames  bolsters  and bearings for the railcar business  as well as flanges for the wind towers business 
our manufacturing operations depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of materials  parts  and components in acceptable quantities and quality from our suppliers 
certain parts and components of our products are currently available from a limited number of suppliers though generally a minimum of two suppliers continue to produce the parts and components we use in our products and  as a result  we may have limited control over pricing  availability  and delivery schedules 
while we endeavor to be diligent in contractual relationships with our suppliers  if we are unable to purchase a sufficient quantity of parts and components on a timely basis  we could face disruptions in our production and incur delays while we attempt to engage alternative suppliers 
any such disruption could harm our business and adversely impact our results of operations 
reductions in the availability of energy supplies or an increase in energy costs may increase our operating costs 
we use various gases  including natural gas  at our manufacturing facilities and use diesel fuel in vehicles to transport our products to customers and to operate our plant equipment 
an outbreak or escalation of hostilities between the us and any foreign power and  in particular  prolonged conflicts could result in a real or perceived shortage of petroleum and or natural gas  which could result in an increase in the cost of natural gas or energy in general 
hurricanes or other natural disasters could result in a real or perceived shortage of petroleum and or natural gas potentially resulting in an increase in natural gas prices or general energy costs 
speculative trading in energy futures in the world markets could also result in an increase in natural gas and general energy cost 
future limitations on the availability or consumption of petroleum products and or an increase in energy costs  particularly natural gas for plant operations and diesel fuel for vehicles and plant equipment  could have an adverse effect upon our ability to conduct our business cost effectively 
our manufacturer warranties expose us to product replacement and repair claims 
depending on the product  we warrant against manufacturing defects due to our workmanship and certain materials  parts  and components pursuant to express limited contractual warranties 
accordingly  we may be subject to significant warranty claims in the future such as multiple claims based on one defect repeated throughout our production process or claims for which the cost of repairing or replacing the defective part  component or material is highly disproportionate to the original cost 
these types of warranty claims could result in costly product recalls  significant repair or replacement costs  and damage to our reputation 
increasing insurance claims and expenses could lower profitability and increase business risk 
the nature of our business subjects us to product liability  property damage  and personal injury claims  especially in connection with the repair and manufacture of products that transport hazardous  toxic  or volatile materials 
over the last several years  insurance carriers have raised premiums for many companies operating in our industries 
increased premiums may further increase our insurance expense as coverage expires or otherwise cause us to raise our self insured retention 
if the number or severity of claims within our self insured retention increases  we could suffer costs in excess of the reserves we maintain for the reasonably estimable liability in such claims  and although we carry liability insurance coverage at levels based on commercial norms in our industries  an unusually large liability claim or a string of claims based on a failure repeated throughout our production process may exceed our insurance coverage or expose us to uninsured damages if we were unable or elected not to insure against certain hazards because of high premiums or other reasons 
in addition  the availability of  and our ability to collect on  insurance coverage is often subject to factors beyond our control 
if any of our third party insurers fail  cancel our coverage  or otherwise are unable to provide us with adequate insurance coverage  then our overall risk exposure and our operational expenses would increase and the management of our business operations would be disrupted 
moreover  any accident or incident involving us or our products  even if we are fully insured  contractually 
table of contents indemnified  or not held to be liable  could negatively affect our reputation among customers and the public  thereby making it more difficult for us to compete effectively  and could significantly affect the cost and availability of insurance in the future 
risks related to our operations outside of the us  particularly mexico  could decrease our profitability 
our operations outside of the us are subject to the risks associated with cross border business transactions and activities 
political  legal  trade  economic change or instability  unrestrained criminal activities  or social unrest could limit or curtail our respective foreign business activities and operations  including the ability to hire and retain employees 
there has been a significant increase in violence in mexico associated with the mexican government attempts to stop illegal drug trafficking 
we have not  to date  been materially affected by any of these risks  but we cannot predict the likelihood of future effects from such risks or any resulting adverse impact on our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
many items manufactured by us in mexico are sold primarily in the us and the transportation and import of such products may be disrupted 
some foreign countries where we operate have regulatory authorities that regulate railroad safety  railcar and railcar component part design  performance  and manufacture of equipment used on their railroad systems 
if we fail to obtain and maintain certifications of our railcars and railcar parts and components within the various foreign countries where we operate  we may be unable to market and sell our railcars  parts  and components in those countries 
in addition  unexpected changes in laws  rules  and regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  including regulatory initiatives for buying goods produced in america  more stringent or restrictive laws  rules  and regulations relating to labor or the environment  adverse tax consequences  and price exchange controls could limit operations affecting production throughput and making the manufacture and distribution of our products less timely or more difficult 
furthermore  any material change in the quotas  regulations  or duties on imports imposed by the us government and agencies  or on exports by the government of mexico or its agencies  could affect our ability to export products that we manufacture in mexico 
because we have operations outside the us  we could be adversely affected by final judgments of non compliance with the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anti corruption laws of other countries 
equipment failures or extensive damage to our facilities  including as might occur as a result of natural disasters  could lead to production or service curtailments or shutdowns  loss of revenue or higher expenses 
we operate a substantial amount of equipment at our production facilities  several of which are situated in tornado and hurricane zones and on navigable waterways in the us an interruption in production capabilities or maintenance and repair capabilities at our facilities  as a result of equipment failure or acts of nature could reduce or prevent our production  service  or repair of our products and increase our costs and expenses 
a halt of production at any of our manufacturing facilities could severely affect delivery times to our customers 
while we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters that could disrupt our business  we cannot provide assurances that our plans would fully protect us from the effects of all such disasters 
in addition  insurance may not adequately compensate us for any losses incurred as a result of natural or other disasters  which may adversely affect our financial condition 
any significant delay in deliveries could result in cancellation of all or a portion of our orders  cause us to lose future sales  and negatively affect our reputation and our results of operations 
because we do not have employment contracts with our key management employees  we may not be able to retain their services in the future 
our success depends on the continued services of our key management employees  none of whom currently have an employment agreement with us 
although we have historically been largely successful in retaining the services of our key management  we may not be able to do so in the future 
the loss of the services of one or more key members of our management team could result in increased costs associated with attracting and retaining a replacement and could disrupt our operations and result in a loss of revenues 
repercussions from terrorist activities or armed conflict could harm our business 
terrorist activities  anti terrorist efforts  and other armed conflict involving the us or its interests abroad may adversely affect the us and global economies  potentially preventing us from meeting our financial and other obligations 
in particular  the negative impacts of these events may affect the industries in which we operate 
this could result in delays in or cancellations of the purchase of our products or shortages in raw materials  parts  or components 
any of these occurrences could have a material adverse impact on our operating results  revenues  and costs 
violations of or changes in the regulatory requirements applicable to the industries in which we operate may increase our operating costs 
we are subject to extensive regulation by governmental regulatory and industry authorities 
our railcar operations are subject to regulation by the us environmental protection agency  the research and special programs administration and the federal railroad administration  both divisions of the us department of transportation  and the association of american railroads 
these organizations establish rules and regulations for the railcar industry and rail interchange  including construction specifications and standards for the design and manufacture of railcars  mechanical  maintenance  and related standards for railcars  safety of railroad equipment  tracks  and operations  and packaging and transportation of hazardous or toxic materials 
future changes that affect compliance costs may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
our inland barge operations are subject to regulation by the us coast guard  the us national transportation safety board  the us customs service  the maritime administration of the us department of transportation  and private industry organizations 
table of contents such as the american bureau of shipping 
these organizations establish safety criteria  investigate vessel accidents and recommend improved safety standards 
violations of these laws and related regulations can result in substantial civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctions curtailing operations 
our construction products group business is subject to regulation by the us department of transportation  the federal highway administration  and various state highway departments 
these organizations establish certain standards and specifications related to the manufacture of our highway products 
if our products were found to be not in compliance with these standards and specifications  we would be required to re qualify our products for installation on state and national highways 
our operations are also subject to regulation of health and safety matters by the us occupational safety and health administration and the us mine safety and health administration 
although we believe we employ appropriate precautions to protect our employees and others from workplace injuries and harmful exposure to materials handled and managed at our facilities  claims that may be asserted against us for work related illnesses or injury  and the further adoption of occupational and mine safety and health regulations in the us or in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate could increase our operating costs 
we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these health and safety laws and regulations 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will not become involved in future litigation  investigations  or other proceedings or if we were found to be responsible or liable in any litigation  investigations  or proceedings  that such costs would not be material to us 
some of our customers place orders for our products in reliance on their ability to access government subsidies in the form of early tax benefits or tax credits such as accelerated depreciation or the production tax credit for renewable energy 
there is no assurance that the us government will reauthorize  modify  or otherwise not allow the expiration of such early tax benefits or tax credits  and in cases where such subsidies are materially modified to reduce the available early benefit or credit  or otherwise allowed to expire  the demand for our products could decrease  thereby creating the potential for a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we may be required to reduce the value of our long lived assets and or goodwill  which would weaken our financial results 
we periodically evaluate for potential impairment the carrying values of our long lived assets to be held and used 
the carrying value of a long lived asset to be held and used is considered impaired when the carrying value is not recoverable through undiscounted future cash flows and the fair value of the asset is less than the carrying value 
fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved or market quotes as available 
impairment losses on long lived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner  except that fair values are reduced commensurate with the estimated cost to dispose of the assets 
in addition  goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually  or on an interim basis whenever events or circumstances change  indicating that the carrying amount of the goodwill might be impaired 
impairment losses related to reductions in the value of our long lived assets or our goodwill could weaken our financial condition and results of operations 
we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
under varying circumstances  we seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate hedges and similar financial instruments and other activities  although these measures  if and when implemented  may not be effective 
any material and untimely changes in interest rates or exchange rates could result in significant losses to us 
railcars as a significant mode of transporting freight could decline  become more efficient over time  experience a shift in types of modal transportation  and or certain railcar types could become obsolete 
as the freight transportation markets we serve continue to evolve and become more efficient  the use of railcars may decline in favor of other more economic transportation modalities 
features and functionality specific to certain railcar types could result in those railcars becoming obsolete as customer requirements for freight delivery change 
business  regulatory  and legal developments regarding climate change may affect the demand for our products or the ability of our critical suppliers to meet our needs 
we have followed the current debate over climate change in general  and the related science  policy discussion  and prospective legislation 
additionally  the potential challenges and opportunities for the company that climate change policy and legislation may pose have been reviewed 
however  any such challenges or opportunities are heavily dependent on the nature and degree of climate change legislation and the extent to which it applies to our industries 
at this time  the company cannot predict the ultimate impact of climate change and climate change legislation on the company operations or opportunities 
potential opportunities could include greater demand for wind towers and certain types of railcars  while potential challenges could include decreased demand for certain types of railcars and higher energy costs 
further  when or if these impacts may occur cannot be assessed until scientific analysis and legislative policy are more developed and specific legislative proposals begin to take shape 
changes in accounting standards or inaccurate estimates or assumptions in the application of accounting policies could adversely affect our financial results 
our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our 
table of contents financial condition and results of operations 
some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported value of our assets or liabilities and financial results and are critical because they require management to make difficult  subjective  and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards such as the financial accounting standards board  the sec  and our independent registered public accounting firm may amend or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied 
these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively  resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements 
for a further discussion of some of our critical accounting policies and standards and recent accounting changes  see critical accounting policies and estimates in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
shortages of skilled labor could adversely impact our operations 
we depend on skilled labor in the manufacture and repair of our products 
some of our facilities are located in areas where demand for skilled laborers may exceed supply 
shortages of some types of skilled laborers  such as welders  could restrict our ability to maintain or increase production rates and could increase our labor costs 
some of our employees belong to labor unions  and strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations 
we are a party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions at some of our operations in the us and all of our operations in mexico 
disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions in the future could result in  among other things  strikes  work stoppages or other slowdowns by the affected workers 
we cannot be assured that our relations with our workforce will remain positive or that union organizers will not be successful in future attempts to organize at some of our facilities 
if our workers were to engage in a strike  work stoppage or other slowdown  or other employees were to become unionized  or the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were renegotiated  we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and higher ongoing labor costs 
in addition  we could face higher labor costs in the future as a result of severance or other charges associated with lay offs  shutdowns or reductions in the size and scope of our operations or difficulties of restarting our operations that have been temporarily shuttered 
from time to time we may take tax positions that the internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdictions may contest 
we have in the past and may in the future take tax positions that the internal revenue service irs or other taxing jurisdictions may challenge 
beginning with the tax return  we are required to disclose to the irs as part of our tax returns for that year and future years particular tax positions in which we have a reasonable basis for the position but not a more likely than not chance of prevailing 
if the irs successfully contests a tax position that we take  we may be required to pay additional taxes or fines which may not have been previously accrued that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
our inability to produce and disseminate relevant and or reliable data and information pertaining to our business in an efficient  cost effective  secure  and well controlled fashion may have significant negative impacts on confidentiality requirements and obligations and proprietary needs and expectations and  therefore  our future operations  profitability  and competitive position 
management relies on it infrastructure  including hardware  network  software  people  and processes to provide useful and confidential information to conduct our business in the ordinary course  including correspondence and commercial data and information interchange with customers  suppliers  legal counsel  governmental agencies  and financial institutions consultants  and to support assessments and conclusions about future plans and initiatives pertaining to market demands  operating performance  and competitive positioning 
in addition  any material failure  interruption of service  or compromised data security could adversely affect our relations with suppliers and customers  place us in violation of confidentiality and data protection laws  rules  and regulations  and result in negative impacts to our market share  operations  and profitability 
security breaches in our information technology could result in theft  destruction  loss  misappropriation  or release of confidential data or intellectual property which could adversely impact our future results 
discord  conflict  and lack of compromise within and amongst the executive and legislative branches of the us government relative to federal government budgeting  taxation policies  government expenditures  and us borrowing debt ceiling limits could adversely affect our business and operating results 
the inability of the legislative and executive branches of the us government to pass a federal government budget  address tax revenue requirements  control deficit spending  and effectively manage short and long term us government borrowing  debt ratings  and debt ceiling adjustments  could negatively impact us domestic and global financial markets thereby reducing demand by our customers for our products and services thereby reducing revenues 
similarly  if our suppliers face challenges in obtaining credit  in selling their products  or otherwise in operating their businesses  they may become unable to continue to offer the materials we purchase from them to manufacture our products 
these actions could result in reductions in our revenues  increased price competition  or increased operating costs  which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents the company could potentially fail to successfully integrate new businesses or products into its current business 
the company routinely engages in the search for growth opportunities  including assessment of merger and acquisition prospects in new markets and or products 
any merger or acquisition in which the company becomes involved and ultimately concludes is subject to integration into the company businesses and culture 
if such integration is unsuccessful to any material degree  such lack of success could have a material adverse effect on our business  operations  or overall financial condition
