presentation of financial and operating data we operate on a fiscal year that ends on the last tuesday in december 
fiscal years  and were weeks in length  while the quarters for those years were weeks in length 
fiscal year will be weeks in length and  as such  the fourth quarter of fiscal will be weeks in length 
long term strategies to grow earnings per share our long term strategies with respect to increasing net income and earnings per share  along with creating shareholder value  include the following expanding our restaurant base 
we will continue to evaluate opportunities to develop texas roadhouse restaurants in existing markets and new domestic and international markets 
domestically  we will remain focused primarily on mid sized markets where we believe a significant demand for our restaurants exists because of population size  income levels and the presence of shopping and entertainment centers and a significant employment base 
our ability to expand our restaurant base is influenced by many factors beyond our control and therefore we may not be able to achieve our anticipated growth 
our average capital investment for texas roadhouse restaurants opened during 
table of contents  including pre opening expenses and a capitalized rent factor  was million  which is slightly higher than our average capital investment in of million 
we anticipate that our development costs will be slightly higher than our costs 
we continue to focus on driving sales and managing restaurant development costs in order to further increase our restaurant development in the future 
we may  at our discretion  add franchise restaurants  domestically and or internationally  primarily with franchisees who have demonstrated prior success with texas roadhouse or other restaurant concepts and in markets in which the franchisee demonstrates superior knowledge of the demographics and restaurant operating conditions 
in conjunction with this strategy  we signed our first international franchise agreement in for the development of texas roadhouse restaurants in eight countries in the middle east over the next ten years  two of which are currently open 
additionally  in  we entered into a joint venture agreement with a casual dining restaurant operator in china for minority ownership in three non texas roadhouse restaurants  two of which are currently open 
we continue to explore opportunities in other countries for international expansion 
we may also look to acquire franchise restaurants under terms favorable to the company and our stockholders 
additionally  from time to time  we will evaluate potential mergers  acquisitions  joint ventures or other strategic initiatives to acquire or develop additional concepts 
of the restaurants we owned and operated at december   we operated as texas roadhouse restaurants  while two operated under the name of aspen creek 
we currently plan to open approximately company restaurants in  all of which will be texas roadhouse restaurants 
in addition  we anticipate our existing franchise partners will open as many as five texas roadhouse restaurants  primarily international  in maintaining and or improving restaurant level profitability 
we plan to maintain  or possibly increase  restaurant level profitability through a combination of increased comparable restaurant sales and operating cost management 
in  our average unit volumes and comparable restaurant sales increased and  respectively  for texas roadhouse restaurants 
the growth in these measures was primarily due to menu price increases taken throughout and along with higher guest traffic counts 
in an effort to partially offset inflationary pressures  we increased menu prices approximately in late  in early and to during in general  we continue to balance the impacts of inflationary pressures with our value positioning as we remain focused on the long term success of texas roadhouse 
this may create a challenge in terms of maintaining and or increasing restaurant margins  as a percentage of sales  in any given year  depending on the level of inflation we experience 
however  in addition to restaurant margin  as a percentage of sales  we also focus on restaurant margin dollar growth per store week as a measure of restaurant level profitability 
in terms of driving higher guest traffic counts  we remain focused on encouraging repeat visits by our guests through our continued commitment to operational standards relating to our quality of food and service 
in order to attract new guests and increase the frequency of visits of our existing guests  we also continue to drive various localized marketing programs  to focus on speed of service and to increase throughput by adding seats in certain restaurants 
leveraging our scalable infrastructure 
to support our growth  we continue to make investments in our infrastructure 
over the past several years  we have made significant investments in our infrastructure including information systems  real estate  human resources  legal  marketing and operations 
our goal is to have general and administrative costs increase at a slower growth rate than our revenue 
in  general and administrative costs increased at a faster growth rate than our revenue as a result of a legal settlement charge of million recorded in the first quarter of whether we are able to continue leveraging our infrastructure will depend  in part  on our new restaurant openings and our comparable restaurant sales growth rate going forward 
returning capital to shareholders 
we continue to evaluate opportunities to return capital to our shareholders through the payment of dividends and or repurchases of common stock 
we started paying 
table of contents dividends in  where we declared regular dividends of million  or per share of common stock per share per quarter 
in  we increased our regular quarterly dividend to per share of common stock and declared regular dividends of million  or per share of common stock 
in addition  we declared a non regular dividend of per share of common stock  or million  in december our long term strategy includes increasing our regular quarterly dividend amount over time 
the declaration and payment of cash dividends on our common stock is at the discretion of our board of directors  and any decision to declare a dividend will be based on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  earnings  financial condition  applicable covenants under our credit facility and other contractual restrictions  or other factors deemed relevant 
on february   our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to million of our common stock

table of contents restaurant sales restaurant sales increased by in as compared to and in compared to these increases were attributable to the opening of new restaurants and an increase in average unit volumes  primarily comparable restaurant sales 
the following table summarizes certain key drivers and or attributes of restaurant sales at company restaurants for the periods 
company restaurants increase in store weeks increase in average unit volumes other total increase in restaurant sales store weeks comparable restaurant sales growth texas roadhouse restaurants only comparable restaurant sales growth average unit volume in thousands includes the impact of the year over year change in sales volume of all aspen creek restaurants  along with texas roadhouse restaurants open less than six months before the beginning of the period measured  and  if applicable  the impact of restaurants closed during the period 
the increases in store weeks for the periods presented above are attributable to the opening of new restaurants 
company restaurant count activity is shown in the restaurant unit activity table above 
the increase in average unit volume for compared to was primarily driven by positive comparable restaurant sales  partially offset by lower year over year sales for the newer restaurants included in our average unit volumes  but excluded from comparable restaurant sales 
comparable restaurant sales of in was primarily due to increases in our per person average check of  along with increases in guest traffic counts of 
the menu price increases we have taken in and are driving the increase in our per person average check 
in  we increased menu prices approximately in the first quarter and approximately in early december 
in  we increased menu prices approximately to with just over during the first quarter of the year and the remaining during the third and fourth quarters of the year 
these menu price increases were taken as a result of inflationary pressures  primarily commodities 
the increase in average unit volume for compared to was primarily driven by positive comparable restaurant sales  along with higher year over year sales for newer restaurants included in our average unit volumes  but excluded from comparable restaurant sales 
for  comparable restaurant sales increased primarily due to an increase in guest traffic counts of  along with an increase in our per person average check driven by menu price increases taken in as previously discussed 
in  we plan to open approximately company restaurants 
we have either begun construction or have sites under contract for purchase or lease for of the restaurants 

table of contents franchise royalties and fees franchise royalties and fees increased by million or by in from and million or by in from these increases were primarily attributable to an increase in average unit volumes  increasing royalty rates in conjunction with the renewal of certain franchise agreements  and the opening of new franchise restaurants 
franchise comparable restaurant sales increased by in and in franchise restaurant count activity is shown in the restaurant unit activity table above 
we anticipate our existing franchise partners will open as many as five texas roadhouse restaurants  primarily international  in on december   we acquired two franchise restaurants 
these acquisitions had no impact on diluted earnings per share as the acquisition occurred on the last day of our fiscal year 
in both and  these restaurants paid us million in franchise royalties  respectively 
we expect that the acquisition will have no significant net revenue or accretive net income impact on an on going annual basis 
restaurant cost of sales restaurant cost of sales  as a percentage of restaurant sales  increased to in from in this increase was primarily attributable to commodity inflation of approximately in  partially offset by the impact of menu pricing actions in and and the benefit of favorable mix shift 
inflation was driven by higher food costs on items such as beef and pork  partially offset by lower costs for certain produce items  specifically potatoes 
the benefit of favorable mix shift was primarily driven by the addition of pictures to the menu in late january which has resulted in higher sales for the items shown 
these items have a slightly lower food cost  as a percentage of sales  than other items within the same category 
for  we have fixed price contracts for to of our overall food costs with the remainder subject to fluctuating market prices 
we expect commodity cost inflation of to in restaurant cost of sales  as a percentage of restaurant sales  increased to in from in this increase was primarily attributable to commodity inflation of approximately for inflation was driven by higher food costs on items such as potatoes  pork  beef  cheese and wheat ingredients 
restaurant labor expenses restaurant labor expenses  as a percentage of restaurant sales  decreased to in from in the decrease was primarily driven by an increase in average unit volumes  partially offset by higher average wage rates and labor inefficiencies associated with recently opened restaurants 
the timing of restaurant openings in and led to an increase in labor inefficiencies  as a percentage of restaurant sales in typically  restaurants open with an initial start up period of higher than normalized sales volumes and higher than normalized labor costs  as a percentage of sales 
restaurant labor expenses  as a percentage of restaurant sales  increased to in from in higher payroll taxes and the impact of labor inefficiencies associated with newer restaurants were partially offset by the benefit from an increase in average unit volumes and lower workers compensation costs 
in  higher payroll tax expense was primarily due to the benefit we obtained in from exemptions under the hiring incentives to restore employment hire act  which was recorded as a reduction in payroll tax expense 
for  the exemptions under the hire act were replaced by a tax credit which results in a reduction in income tax expense rather than payroll tax expense 
for  the net impact of this change year over year was an increase in payroll expense of million 
in addition  
table of contents we experienced higher state unemployment taxes throughout workers compensation costs were million lower in compared to due to changes in our claims development history 
in  we anticipate our labor costs will be pressured by continued wage rate inflation due to continued state mandated increases in minimum and tip wage rates 
these increases may or may not be offset by additional menu price adjustments and or guest traffic growth 
restaurant rent expense restaurant rent expense  as a percentage of restaurant sales  remained unchanged at in compared to and in all periods presented  the benefit from an increase in average unit volumes offset the impact of leasing more land and buildings than we have in the past 
restaurant other operating expenses restaurant other operating expenses  as a percentage of restaurant sales  decreased to in from in this decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in average unit volumes and lower utility costs and credit card fees  partially offset by higher costs for managing partner and market partner bonuses  as a percentage of sales 
managing partner and market partner bonuses were higher in as a result of improved restaurant sales and higher restaurant margins 
restaurant other operating expenses  as a percentage of restaurant sales  decreased to in from in this decrease was attributable to an increase in average unit volumes and lower general liability insurance  utility and property tax costs 
general liability insurance costs were lower in as we had additional insurance expense in of million due to changes in our claims development history related to our quarterly actuarial reports 
utility costs were lower primarily due to lower electricity and natural gas prices 
restaurant pre opening expenses pre opening expenses in increased to million from million in and increased to million in from million in these increases were primarily attributable to more restaurant openings each year versus the prior year 
we opened company restaurants in compared to company restaurants in and company restaurants in additionally  we plan to open company restaurants in pre opening costs will fluctuate from period to period based on the number and timing of restaurant openings and the number and timing of restaurant managers hired 
based on our increased restaurant development plans  we expect pre opening expense to be higher in depreciation and amortization expenses d a d a  as a percentage of revenue  decreased to in from in and decreased to in from in along with an increase in average unit volumes  these decreases were primarily due to lower depreciation expense  as a percentage of revenue  on older restaurants as depreciation expense on short lived assets  such as equipment  has ended 
the decrease was partially offset by higher depreciation  as a percentage of revenue  at new restaurants 
impairment and closure expenses impairment and closure expenses increased to million in from million in  which was a decrease from million in in  we recorded million of impairment expense associated with the impairment of goodwill and intangible asset related to one restaurant and million of impairment expense associated with the write down of assets  primarily land and building  related to a restaurant which was closed in in  we recorded million of 
table of contents impairment expense associated with the impairment of goodwill related to one restaurant and million of impairment expense associated with the write down of assets  primarily land and building  related to a restaurant which was closed in in  we recorded million of impairment expense associated with the impairment of goodwill related to four restaurants and million related to the write down of equipment and ongoing closure costs associated with one restaurant  which was closed in for all years presented  we also incurred costs primarily attributable to various restaurant closures in prior fiscal years 
the goodwill impairment charges in the periods presented resulted from our annual testing  which relies  in part  on the historical and projected future cash flows of individual restaurants 
we assign goodwill at the individual restaurant level 
as such  we anticipate that we will incur future impairment charges as the historical and or projected future financial performance of these restaurants change 
the amount and timing of any potential future charges  however  is difficult to predict 
see note in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding closures and impairments recorded in  and  including the impairments of goodwill and other long lived assets 
general and administrative expenses g a g a  as a percentage of total revenue  increased to in from in the increase was primarily attributable to higher legal settlement charges  along with higher costs associated with share based compensation  partially offset by an increase in average unit volumes and lower costs related to our annual managing partner conference in the second quarter of in the first quarter of  we recorded a one time  pre tax charge of million million after tax related to the settlement of a previously disclosed legal matter 
this charge had a impact on diluted earnings per share in share based compensation costs were approximately million higher in compared to primarily driven by a higher stock price associated with a grant of restricted stock units on january  in conjunction with the execution of certain executive employment contracts at the beginning of based primarily on the location of our annual managing partner conference in the second quarter of  we expect our annual conference costs to be approximately million higher in compared to overall  in  total g a cost  excluding the legal settlement charge  increased at a slower growth rate than our revenue 
total g a cost in may increase at a higher growth rate than our revenue  excluding the impact of the legal settlement charge in g a  as a percentage of total revenue  remained unchanged at in compared to for  an increase in average unit volumes and lower performance based bonus expense as a result of lower plan profitability compared to the prior year were offset by higher costs associated with share based compensation costs  legal fees  marketing and travel costs

our effective tax rate increased to in from in the increase in was primarily attributable to the loss of the hire retention tax credit  higher non deductible officer compensation and lower worker opportunity tax credits wotc as a percentage of pre tax income  partially offset by higher fica tip credits 
for  we expect the tax rate to decrease to approximately  due to higher federal tax credits  primarily due to the reinstatement of wotc  and an expected decrease in non deductible officer compensation 
our effective tax rate decreased to in from in the decrease in was primarily attributable to higher federal tax credits  including hire act tax credits  lower non deductible officer compensation  and the benefit of certain incentive stock options exercised during the quarter 
the hire act tax credit is a federal tax credit enacted to encourage the retention of new hires for weeks 
the credit is only available for eligible new employees hired between february  and december  that remain employed for consecutive weeks

the continued opening of new restaurants and an increase in comparable restaurant sales drove our sales growth 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in this increase was primarily due to changes in working capital  along with increases in share based compensation and net income 
net income was million higher as a result of opening new restaurants and average unit volume growth  partially offset by lower margins 
our operations have not required significant working capital and  like many restaurant companies  we have been able to operate with negative working capital 
sales are primarily for cash  and restaurant operations do not require significant inventories or receivables 
in addition  we receive trade credit for the purchase of food  beverages and supplies  thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support growth 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures on the refurbishment of existing restaurants  such as remodeling  room additions and other general maintenance  along with the acquisition of two franchise restaurants on the last day of the fiscal year for a purchase price of million

these amounts were recorded as an expense in the income statement as incurred 
our future capital requirements will primarily depend on the number of new restaurants we open  the timing of those openings and the restaurant prototype developed in a given fiscal year 
these requirements will include costs directly related to opening new restaurants and may also include costs necessary to allow our infrastructure to support a larger restaurant base 
in  we expect our capital expenditures to be to million  the majority of which will relate to planned restaurant openings  including restaurant openings in this amount excludes any cash used for franchise acquisitions 
we intend to satisfy our capital requirements over the next months with cash on hand  net cash provided by operating activities and  if needed  funds available under our credit facility

on october   we entered into an interest rate swap  starting on november   with a notional amount of million to hedge a portion of the cash flows of our variable rate credit facility 
we have designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge of our exposure to variability in future cash flows attributable to interest payments on a million tranche of floating rate debt borrowed under our revolving credit facility 
under the terms of the swap  we pay a fixed rate of on the million notional amount and receive payments from the counterparty based on the month libor for a term ending on november   effectively resulting in a fixed rate libor component of the million notional amount

recent accounting pronouncements comprehensive income asu in june  the fasb issued asu  presentation of comprehensive income 
asu eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity  which was our presentation  and also requires presentation of reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive income to net income on the face of the financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued asu  deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in asu  to defer the effective date of the specific requirement to present items that are reclassified out of accumulated comprehensive income to net income alongside their respective components of net income and other comprehensive income 
all other provisions of this update are effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december  our fiscal year 
the adoption of this new guidance had no impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows  though it changed our financial statement presentation 
goodwill and other intangibles asu in september  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other  testing goodwill for impairment  which permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit fair value is less than its carrying value before applying the two step goodwill impairment model that is currently in place 
if it is determined through the qualitative assessment that a reporting unit fair value is more likely than not greater than its carrying value  the remaining impairment steps would be unnecessary 
the qualitative assessment is optional  allowing companies to go directly to the quantitative assessment 
this update is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after december  our fiscal year 
the adoption of this new guidance had no impact on the content of our financial statements or disclosures 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the above discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that we believe are most important to portraying our financial condition and results of operations and also require the greatest amount of subjective or complex judgments by management 
judgments or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment at the individual restaurant level when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable 
when we evaluate restaurants  cash flows are the primary indicator of impairment 
our evaluation requires an estimation of the future undiscounted cash flows from operating the restaurant over its estimated useful life  which can be for a period of over years 
in the estimation of future cash flows  we consider the period of time the restaurant has been open  the trend of operations over such period and future periods and expectations for future sales growth 
we limit assumptions about important factors such as trend of future operations and sales growth to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the restaurant and actual results at comparable restaurants 
both qualitative and quantitative information are considered when evaluating for potential impairments 
as we assess the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our long lived assets  these factors could cause us to realize a material impairment charge 
if assets are determined to be impaired  we measure the impairment charge by calculating the amount by which the asset carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
the determination of asset fair value is also subject to significant judgment 
we generally measure estimated fair value by discounting estimated future cash flows or by independent third party appraisal  if available 
when fair value is measured by discounting estimated future cash flows  the assumptions used are consistent with what we believe hypothetical market participants would use 
we also use a discount rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent in the projected cash flows 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
see note in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding closures and impairments recorded in  and  including the impairments of goodwill and other long lived assets 
goodwill 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment  and is tested more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
we have assigned goodwill to the reporting unit  which we consider to be the individual restaurant level 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of impairment consists of two steps 
first  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to its carrying amount 
the fair value of the reporting unit may be based on several valuation approaches including capitalization of earnings  discounted cash flows  comparable public company market multiples and comparable acquisition market multiples 
second  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit  in a manner similar to 
table of contents a purchase price allocation 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
the valuation approaches used to determine fair value are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change such as our appropriate revenue growth rates  operating margins  weighted average cost of capital  and comparable company and acquisition market multiples 
in estimating the fair value using the discounted cash flows or the capitalization of earnings method we consider the period of time the restaurant has been open  the trend of operations over such period and future periods  expectations of future sales growth and terminal value 
assumptions about important factors such as trend of future operations and sales growth are limited to those that are supportable based upon the plans for the restaurant and actual results at comparable restaurants 
when developing these key judgments and assumptions  we consider economic  operational and market conditions that could impact our fair value 
the judgments and assumptions used are consistent with what we believe hypothetical market participants would use 
however  estimates are inherently uncertain and represent only our reasonable expectations regarding future developments 
if the estimates used in performing the impairment test prove inaccurate  the fair value of the restaurants may ultimately prove to be significantly lower  thereby causing the carrying value to exceed the fair value and indicating impairment has occurred 
at december   we had reporting units  primarily at the restaurant level  with allocated goodwill of million 
the average amount of goodwill associated with each reporting unit is million with six reporting units having goodwill in excess of million 
based on our estimate of fair value  we are currently monitoring five restaurants with total goodwill of million for potential impairment 
since we determine the fair value of goodwill at the restaurant level  any significant decreases in cash flows at these restaurants or others could trigger an impairment charge in the future 
the fair value of each of our other reporting units was substantially in excess of their respective carrying values as of the goodwill impairment test 
see note in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding closures and impairments recorded in  and  including the impairments of goodwill and other long lived assets 
insurance reserves 
we self insure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers compensation  general liability  employment practices liability and property insurance programs 
in addition  starting in fiscal  we self insure a significant portion of expected losses under our employee healthcare insurance program 
we purchase insurance for individual claims that exceed the amounts listed below employment practices liability workers compensation general liability property employee healthcare we record a liability for unresolved claims and for an estimate of incurred but not reported claims at the anticipated cost to us based on estimates provided by management  a third party administrator and or an actuary 
our estimated liability is based on a number of assumptions and factors regarding economic conditions  the frequency and severity of claims and claim development history and settlement practices 
an increase or decrease in the discount rate of basis points would change the reserve  and resulting expense  by an immaterial amount 
we also monitor actuarial observations of historical claim development for the industry 
our assumptions are reviewed  monitored  and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with asc under which deferred assets and liabilities are recognized based upon anticipated future tax consequences attributable to 
table of contents differences between financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
any change in the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
uncertain tax positions are accounted for under fasb asc fasb asc requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not ie  a likelihood of more than fifty percent that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities that have full knowledge of all relevant information 
a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement 
leases and leasehold improvements 
we lease land  buildings and or certain equipment for the majority of our restaurants under non cancelable lease agreements 
our land and building leases typically have initial terms ranging from to years  and certain renewal options for one or more five year periods 
we account for leases in accordance with asc  leases  and other related authoritative guidance 
when determining the lease term  we include option periods for which failure to renew the lease imposes a penalty on us in such an amount that a renewal appears  at the inception of the lease  to be reasonably assured 
the primary penalty to which we are subject is the economic detriment associated with the existence of leasehold improvements which might become impaired if we choose not to continue the use of the leased property 
certain of our operating leases contain predetermined fixed escalations of the minimum rent during the original term of the lease 
for these leases  we recognize the related rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease term and record the difference between the amounts charged to operations and amounts paid as deferred rent 
we generally do not receive rent concessions or leasehold improvement incentives upon opening a restaurant that is subject to a lease 
we may receive rent holidays  which would begin on the possession date and end when the lease commences  during which no cash rent payments are typically due under the terms of the lease 
rent holidays are included in the lease term when determining straight line rent expense 
additionally  certain of our operating leases contain clauses that provide for additional contingent rent based on a percentage of sales greater than certain specified target amounts 
we recognize contingent rent expense prior to the achievement of the specified target that triggers the contingent rent  provided achievement of the target is considered probable 
this may result in some variability in rent expense as a percentage of revenues over the term of the lease in restaurants where we pay contingent rent 
the judgment regarding the probable term for each restaurant property lease impacts the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating  the rent holiday and or escalation in payments that are taken into consideration when calculating straight line rent and the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant are amortized 
the material factor we consider when making this judgment is the total amount invested in the restaurant at the inception of the lease and whether management believes that renewal appears reasonably assured 
while a different term may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  amortization and rent expense than reported  our historical lease renewal rates support the judgments made 
we have not made any changes to the nature of the assumptions used to account for leases in any of the fiscal years presented in our consolidated financial statements 
in an exposure draft issued in  the fasb  together with the international accounting standards board  has proposed a comprehensive set of changes in generally accepted accounting policies gaap for leases 
we are continuing to monitor the fasb and international accounting standards board activities regarding leases and will disclose expected impacts on our business and financial statements as rules are finalized 

table of contents effects of inflation we have not operated in a period of high general inflation for the last several years  however  we have experienced material increases in certain commodity costs  specifically beef 
in addition  a significant number of our team members are paid at rates related to the federal and or state minimum wage and  accordingly  increases in minimum wage have increased our labor costs for the last several years 
we have increased menu prices and made other adjustments over the past few years  in an effort to offset increases in our restaurant and operating costs resulting from inflation 
whether we are able and or choose to continue to offset the effects of inflation will determine to what extent  if any  inflation affects our restaurant profitability in future periods 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on debt and changes in commodity prices 
our exposure to interest rate fluctuations is limited to our outstanding bank debt 
the terms of the facility require us to pay interest on outstanding borrowings at london interbank offering rate libor plus a margin of to  depending on our leverage ratio  or the alternate base rate  which is the higher of the issuing bank prime lending rate  the federal funds rate plus or the adjusted eurodollar rate for a one month interest period on such day plus 
at december   there was million in outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit  which bears interest at approximately to basis points depending on our leverage ratios over libor 
we had various other notes payable totaling million with fixed interest rates ranging from to 
on october   we entered into an interest rate swap  which started on november   with a notional amount of million to hedge a portion of the cash flows of our variable rate credit facility 
we have designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge of our exposure to variability in future cash flows attributable to interest payments on a million tranche of floating rate debt borrowed under our revolving credit facility 
under the terms of the swap  we pay a fixed rate of on the million notional amount and receive payments from the counterparty based on the month libor rate for a term ending on november   effectively resulting in a fixed rate on the libor component of the million notional amount 
on january   we entered into another interest rate swap  starting february   with a notional amount of million to hedge a portion of the cash flows of our variable rate credit facility 
we have designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge of our exposure to variability in future cash flows attributable to interest payments on a million tranche of floating rate debt borrowed under our revolving credit facility 
under the terms of the swap  we pay a fixed rate of on the million notional amount and receive payments from the counterparty based on the month libor rate for a term ending on january   effectively resulting in a fixed rate libor component of the million notional amount 
by using a derivative instrument to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates  we expose ourselves to credit risk 
credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract 
we minimize the credit risk by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties whose credit rating is evaluated on a quarterly basis 
our counterparty in the interest rate swap is jp morgan chase bank  na many of the ingredients used in the products sold in our restaurants are commodities that are subject to unpredictable price volatility 
currently  we do not utilize fixed price contracts for certain commodities such as produce and certain dairy products  therefore  we are subject to prevailing market conditions when purchasing those types of commodities 
for other commodities  we employ various purchasing and pricing contract techniques in an effort to minimize volatility  including fixed price contracts for terms of one year or less and negotiating prices with vendors with reference to fluctuating 
table of contents market prices 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices  but we will continue to evaluate their effectiveness 
extreme and or long term increases in commodity prices could adversely affect our future results  especially if we are unable  primarily due to competitive reasons  to increase menu prices 
additionally  if there is a time lag between the increasing commodity prices and our ability to increase menu prices or if we believe the commodity price increase to be short in duration and we choose not to pass on the cost increases  our short term financial results could be negatively affected 
we are subject to business risk as our beef supply is highly dependent upon four vendors 
if these vendors were unable to fulfill their obligations under their contracts  we may encounter supply shortages and incur higher costs to secure adequate supplies  any of which would harm our business
