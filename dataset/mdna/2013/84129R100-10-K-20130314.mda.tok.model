item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
item a 
risk factors risks related to our industry there can be no assurance that recent government actions will help stabilize the us financial system 
in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions  various branches and agencies of the us government have put in place laws  regulations and programs to address capital and liquidity issues in the banking system 
there can be no assurance  however  as to the actual long term impact that such laws  regulations and programs will have on the financial markets  including the extreme levels of volatility  liquidity and confidence issues  and limited credit availability recently experienced 
the failure of such laws  regulations and programs to continue to help stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening of current national and international financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  access to credit or the trading price of our common stock 
recent levels of market volatility are unprecedented 
the volatility and disruption of financial and credit markets has reached unprecedented levels for recent times 
in some cases  the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength 
if recent and current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen  there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect  which may be material  on our ability to access capital and on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty  or other relationships 
we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties  and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including brokers  dealers  commercial banks  investment banks  and government sponsored enterprises 
many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty 
in addition  our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral we hold cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or other obligation due us 
there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or earnings 
our primary source of funding for our operations is deposits from customers in our local market 
should other banks in or near our market areas fail  it could cause our deposit customers to lose confidence in banks and cause them to withdraw or substantially restrict their deposits with us 
if such activity reached a high enough level  it could substantially disrupt our business 
there is no assurance that such disruptions  were they to occur  would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or earnings 
current market developments may adversely affect our industry  business and results of operations 
dramatic declines in the housing market during the prior four years  with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment  have resulted in significant write downs of asset values by financial institutions  including government sponsored entities and major commercial and investment banks 
these write downs  initially of mortgage backed securities but spreading to credit default swaps  other derivative securities  as well as loans  have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital  to merge with larger and stronger institutions and  in some cases  to fail 
reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties  many lenders and institutional investors have reduced  and in some cases  ceased to provide funding to borrowers  including other financial institutions 
the resulting lack of available credit  lack of confidence in the financial sector  increased volatility in the financial markets and reduced business activity could materially and adversely  directly or indirectly  affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to governmental regulation which could change and increase our cost of doing business or have an adverse effect on our business 
we operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to examination  supervision and comprehensive regulation by various federal and state agencies 
most of this regulation is designed to protect our depositors and other customers  not our shareholders 
our compliance with the requirements of these agencies is costly and may limit our growth and restrict certain of our activities  including  payment of dividends  mergers and acquisitions  investments  loans and interest rates charged  locations of offices  and compensation of our officers 
we are also subject to capitalization guidelines established by federal authorities and our failure to meet those guidelines could result in limitations being imposed on our activities or  in an extreme case  in our bank s being placed in receivership 
various laws  including the federal deposit insurance act  the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa  and the wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act  and related regulations are structured to spread the governmental costs of problems in the financial industry broadly over the financial industry in order to prevent the taxpayers from having to pay such costs 
as a result  assessments by the fdic to pay for deposit insurance have increased  and will likely continue to increase  substantially  and the total our bank will be required to pay could increase enough to materially affect our income and our ability to operate profitably 
additionally  eesa contains a provision for the financial industry to be required to absorb  in an as yet undetermined fashion  any losses suffered by the government on account of its acquiring troubled assets under the troubled assets relief program of eesa 
the dodd frank act made numerous changes in the way financial institutions are regulated  and creates a new agency to regulate consumer protection as well as expanding and modifying consumer protection laws 
we are also subject to the extensive and expensive requirements imposed on public companies by the sarbanes oxley act of and related regulations the laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry could change at any time  and numerous regulations required by the dodd frank act are yet to be adopted  thus we cannot predict the impact of these changes on our business or profitability 
because government regulation greatly affects the business and financial results of all commercial banks and bank holding companies  our cost of compliance could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably 
we are susceptible to changes in monetary policy and other economic factors which may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably 
changes in governmental  economic and monetary policies may affect the ability of our bank to attract deposits and make loans 
the rates of interest payable on deposits and chargeable on loans are affected by governmental regulation and fiscal policy as well as by national  state and local economic conditions 
national and international economic conditions and governmental efforts to control such conditions affect us directly and indirectly 
all of these matters are outside of our control and affect our ability to operate profitably 
risks related to our business we depend on the services of a number of key personnel  and a loss of any of those personnel could disrupt our operations and result in reduced revenues 
the success of our business depends to a great extent on our customer relationships 
our growth and development to date have depended in large part on the efforts of our senior management team 
these senior officers have primary contact with our customers and are extremely important in maintaining personalized relationships with our customer base  a key aspect of our business strategy  and in increasing our market presence 
the unexpected loss of services of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations and possibly result in reduced revenues if we were unable to find suitable replacements promptly 
we may be unable to successfully manage our sustained growth 
we grew rapidly in our first years of operations 
although we did not grow significantly in  or  and do not expect to continue to grow as fast in the future as we have in the past  it is our intention to continue to expand our asset base 
our future profitability will depend in part on our ability to manage growth successfully 
our ability to manage growth successfully will depend on our ability to maintain cost controls and asset quality while attracting additional loans and deposits  as well as on factors beyond our control  such as economic conditions and interest rate trends 
if we grow too quickly and are not able to control costs and maintain asset quality  growth could materially adversely affect our financial performance 
our future growth or regulatory requirements may require us to raise additional capital in the future  but that capital may not be available when it is needed or be unavailable on favorable terms 
although we are currently well capitalized  we may need to raise additional capital in the future to support additional growth or to meet regulatory requirements 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend  among other things  on conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside our control  and on our financial condition and performance 
if we cannot raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed  our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be limited and  if we cannot continue to meet regulatory capital requirements  our existence could also be limited 
our assets include substantial amounts of real estate acquired through foreclosure or in settlement of loans  which we may not be able to sell without incurring additional losses 
we have acquired  and expect to continue to acquire  substantial amounts of real estate through foreclosure or settlement of loans in default 
when we acquire such real estate  it is written down to its estimated fair market value less the estimated costs of selling 
if we cannot sell the property for that amount we will incur additional loss which  for one or more properties  could materially reduce our earnings 
if our loan customers do not pay us as they have contracted to  we may experience losses 
our principal revenue producing business is making loans 
if the loans are not repaid  we will suffer losses 
even though we maintain an allowance for loan losses  the amount of the allowance may not be adequate to cover the losses we experience 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by a thorough review of the creditworthiness of loan customers 
nevertheless  there is risk that our credit evaluations will prove to be inaccurate due to changed circumstances or otherwise 
our business is concentrated in greater charleston  and a prolonged downturn in the economy of the charleston area  a continuing decline in charleston area real estate values or other events in our market area may adversely affect our business 
substantially all of our business is located in the greater charleston area 
as a result  our financial condition and results of operations are affected by changes in the charleston economy 
over the past four years  we have experienced the adverse effects of the economic recession in the form of increased nonpayment and delinquent payment of loans  and decreases in the value of collateral securing loans and of real estate acquired through foreclosures 
if the economic recession and general decline in charleston area real estate values or other adverse economic conditions continue  we would expect continuing decreases in demand for our services  increases in nonpayment of loans and decreases in the value of collateral securing loans 
the existence of adverse economic conditions  declines in real estate values or the occurrence of other adverse economic conditions in charleston and south carolina could have a material adverse effect on our business  future prospects  financial condition or results of operations 
we operate in an area susceptible to hurricane and other weather related damage which could disrupt our business and reduce our profitability 
nearly all of our business and our customers are located in coastal south carolina  an area that often experiences damage from hurricanes and other weather phenomena 
we attempt to mitigate such risk with insurance and by requiring insurance on property we take as collateral 
however  catastrophic weather damage to a large portion of our market area could cause substantial disruptions to our business and our customers businesses which would reduce our profitability for some period 
we face strong competition from larger  more established competitors which may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably 
we encounter strong competition from financial institutions operating in the greater charleston  south carolina area 
in the conduct of our business  we also compete with credit unions  insurance companies  money market mutual funds and other financial institutions  some of which are not subject to the same degree of regulation as we are 
many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending abilities than we have and offer services  such as investment banking  trust and international banking services that we do not provide 
we believe that we have competed  and will continue to be able to compete  effectively with these institutions because of our experienced bankers and personalized service  as well as through loan participations and other strategies and techniques 
however  we cannot promise that we are correct in our belief 
if we are wrong  our ability to operate profitably may be negatively affected 
technological changes affect our business  and we may have fewer resources than many of our competitors to invest in technological improvements 
the financial services industry continues to undergo rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
in addition to enabling financial institutions to serve customers better  the effective use of technology may increase efficiency and may enable financial institutions to reduce costs 
our future success may depend  in part  upon our ability to use technology to provide products and services that provide convenience to customers and to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
we may need to make significant additional capital investments in technology in the future  and we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
our profitability and liquidity are affected by changes in interest rates and economic conditions 
our profitability depends upon our net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on our interest bearing assets  such as loans and investment securities  and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
our net interest income is adversely affected when market interest rates change such that the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings increases faster than the interest we earn on loans and investments or  conversely  when the interest we earn on loans and investments decreases faster than the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings 
interest rates  and consequently our results of operations  are affected by general economic conditions domestic and foreign and fiscal and monetary policies 
monetary and fiscal policies may materially affect the level and direction of interest rates 
increases in interest rates generally decrease the market values of interest bearing investments and loans held and therefore may adversely affect our liquidity and earnings 
increased interest rates also generally affect the volume of mortgage loan originations  the resale value of mortgage loans originated for resale  and the ability of borrowers to perform under existing loans of all types 
decreases in interest rates generally have the opposite effect on market values of interest bearing assets  the volume of mortgage loan originations  the resale value of mortgage loans originated for resale  and the ability of borrowers to perform under existing loans of all types from the effect of increases in interest rates 
risks related to our common stock our common stock has a limited trading market  which may limit your ability to sell your stock 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq global market under the symbol socb 
since january   the average daily trading volume has been approximately  shares 
accordingly  a shareholder who wishes to sell a large number of shares may experience a delay in selling the shares or have to sell them at a lower price in order to sell them promptly 
the market price of our common stock may continue to decline 
the market prices of many financial institution equity securities  including ours  have declined significantly over three of the past four years in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets 
there can be no assurance that such declines will not resume 
we may issue additional securities  which could affect the market price of our common stock and dilute your ownership 
we may issue additional securities to raise additional capital  to support growth  or to make acquisitions 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock  or the perception by the market that those sales could occur  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or could make it more difficult for us to raise capital through the sale of common stock or to use our common stock in future acquisitions 
the issuance of substantial amounts of additional securities could reduce your proportionate ownership of the company 
we do not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
we have never paid cash dividends and do not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
we plan to use the funds that might otherwise be available to pay dividends to increase our capital 
declaration and payment of dividends are within the discretion of our board of directors 
our bank will be our most likely source of funds with which to pay cash dividends 
our bank s declaration and payment of future dividends to us are within the discretion of the bank s board of directors  and are dependent upon its earnings  financial condition  its need to retain earnings for use in the business and any other pertinent factors 
payment of dividends is also subject to various regulatory requirements and considerations 
furthermore  as long as there are preferred securities of the southcoast capital trust iii outstanding and the company has elected to defer making interest payments with respect to the preferred securities as permitted by the terms of the preferred securities  the company may not declare or pay dividends on its common stock or redeem or repurchase any shares of its common stock  subject to certain minor exceptions  including payment of stock dividends 
provisions in our articles of incorporation and south carolina law may discourage or prevent takeover attempts  and these provisions may have the effect of reducing the market price for our stock 
our articles of incorporation include several provisions that may have the effect of discouraging or preventing hostile takeover attempts  and therefore of making the removal of incumbent management difficult 
the provisions include staggered terms for our board of directors and requirements of supermajority votes to approve certain business transactions 
in addition  south carolina law contains several provisions that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our board of directors  and may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock 
to the extent that these provisions are effective in discouraging or preventing takeover attempts  they may tend to reduce the market price for our stock 
our common stock is not insured  so you could lose your total investment 
our common stock is not a deposit  savings account or obligation of our bank and is not insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency 
should our business fail  you could lose your total investment
