item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview general we are a petroleum company engaged primarily in the acquisition  exploitation and development of properties for the production of crude oil and natural gas  onshore in the united states 
we acquire known  underdeveloped oil and natural gas resources and exploit them through the application of capital  sound engineering and modern technology to increase production  ultimate recoveries  or both 
we are focused on increasing underlying asset values on a per share basis 
in doing so  we depend on a conservative capital structure  allowing us to maintain control of our assets for the benefit of our shareholders  including approximately beneficially owned by our employees 
our strategy is intended to generate scalable  low unit cost  development and re development opportunities that minimize or eliminate exploration risks 
these opportunities involve the application of modern technology  our own proprietary technology and our specific expertise in overlooked areas of the united states 

table of contents the assets we exploit currently fit into three types of project opportunities enhanced oil recovery eor  bypassed primary resources  and unconventional development 
we expect to fund our base fiscal development plan from working capital  with any increases to the base plan funded out of working capital  net cash flows from our properties in the giddings and delhi fields and appropriate financing vehicles 
highlights for our fiscal year oil gas reserves pv of proved reserves increased to million from last year million  despite the aggregate sales of mmboe of reserves and a lower oil price 
the increase in pv a non gaap measure reconciled to the gaap measure below was primarily due to positive revisions in our delhi reserves offset by the sale of most of our nongarp assets in the giddings field and a portion of our mississippian lime leasehold as well as mmboe of production and a lower oil price at delhi 
the positive revisions at delhi were due to upgrades of probable reserves  increased ooip based on revised geological maps developed from acquired seismic data  field performance and the inclusion of natural gas processing as part of the project 
proved developed reserves increased to million boe compared to mmboe in  or of total proved volumes compared to the previous year 
the increase in proved developed reserves is primarily due to development expenditures by the operator of our delhi field 
our black oil volumes increased from of proved reserves to in pv of probable reserves decreased to million on an decrease in volumes to million boes 
half of the decrease in volumes was a result of the sale of a portion of our mississippian lime leasehold  and the balance of the decrease was due to an upgrade of reserves to the proved category and a decrease in recovery per mississippian lime drilling location  offset by added reserves from gas processing at delhi 
proved probable change change reserves mmboe developed liquids pv in millions we believe the presentation of pv provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by analysts and investors in evaluating oil and natural gas companies and the relative monetary significance of their oil and natural gas properties 
pv is not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves  nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of after tax discounted future net cash flows as defined under gaap 
see estimated oil and natural gas reserves and estimated future net revenues under item properties of this form k for a reconciliation of pv to the standardized measure 

table of contents projects additional property information is available under item business  item properties  notes to the financial statements and exhibits of this form k delhi field eor northeast louisiana as of june   d m independent reserve report for our delhi interests reflects an assumed reversionary working interest payout date of january   a increase in estimated original oil in place ooip to million barrels  compared to prior estimates of million barrels  which includes accelerated development of one smaller reservoir from late in the decade to the timeframe  continued roll out of the co flood through  installation of natural gas processing to recover methane and heavier ngls that are currently being produced and re injected back into the field with the recycled co stream  continued expansion into three small reservoirs at the end of the decade  and the addition of possible reserves to account for secondary recovery reserves not produced during the pressure maintenance phase of the field that utilized a limited sweep of the reservoir with injected water as compared to a more efficiently designed water flood 
proved reserves estimates increased to million boe at delhi  based on expected future net capital expenditures of approximately million in calendar  million in calendar and million in calendar the inclusion of natural gas processing beginning in is based upon a third party engineering study performed with the input of the operator  vetted by d m  and based on the measured levels of hydrocarbons in our recycle stream 
d m assigned the following net reserves to our interests at delhi as of june   bbls of proved oil equivalent reserves  with a pv of million  bbls of probable oil equivalent reserves  with a pv of million  bbls of possible oil equivalent reserves  with a pv of million of proved volumes are developed 
of probable reserves are developed 
of possible reserves are developed 
proved reserves at delhi are associated with a projected recovery of ooip and condensate recovered from the recycle gas stream 
probable reserves are associated with an increase in recovery from to of ooip from existing and future wells  extension of the co flood into three small reservoirs at a point in time beyond the five year development period allowed for proved undeveloped reserves  and natural gas and ngls recovered from the recycle gas stream 
possible reserves are associated with an increase in recovery from to of ooip from existing and future wells due to secondary recovery reserves not produced during the pressure maintenance phase of the field as a result of limited sweep efficiency of injected water 
possible reserves are generally projected to be produced during the latter life of the project 
consequently  pv of proved reserves is a non gaap measure  reconciled to the standardized measure at estimated oil and natural gas reserves and estimated future net revenues under item properties of this form k 
probable and possible reserves are not recognized by gaap  and therefore the pv of probable and possible reserves cannot be reconciled to a gaap measure 

table of contents capital expenditures to date in the field and in the processing plant have developed not just proved  but also probable and possible reserves  thus leading to the categories of probable and possible developed reserves 
currently  all of our delhi production comes from our royalty interest that bears no cost or expense 
at reversion  our net revenue interest will increase from to  and we will begin bearing of all costs 
we expect that the net cash flow from our combined revenue interest after reversion will more than amply cover the projected remaining capital expenditures 
year over year  proved developed reserves increased from to of total delhi proved reserves due to continued investment by the operator and performance in the field  partially offset by the inclusion of new pud reserves due to the addition of natural gas processing 
annual production sales increased year over year at delhi  from net bo per day  gross bo per day to net bo per day  gross bo per day  with phases i thru iv currently producing to varying degrees 
sequentially  fq production sales declined from net bod  gross in fq to net bod  gross 
during our fourth fiscal quarter  revenue from the delhi field sequentially decreased due to lower oil prices  lower production resulting from scheduled plant maintenance  infill drilling  and the effect of a temporary suspension of co injections in the southwestern most flank of the field where a release of well fluids occurred in june of in the near term  we expect our revenues to be temporarily impacted as a result of the environmental event at delhi  as gross field production has dropped from the fourth fiscal quarter average of  bopd to between  and  bopd 
the operator has projected that co injection will resume in the affected area by the th calendar quarter of  after which the field affected oil production is anticipated to gradually recover 
the operator has reported that the released fluids were primarily co  with smaller amounts of salt water  natural gas and a smaller amount of oil 
the operator took immediate remedial action to stop the release and contain and remove all liquids in the affected area  and is working with government officials and agencies to complete the remediation 
during the remediation  the operator has temporarily halted co injection in the affected area surrounding one or more previously abandoned wells suspected of being the cause of the leak in order to relieve pressure during the remediation 
production from wells in the affected area has continued  but has also declined due to the reduced injection volumes that provide the necessary drive for tertiary oil production 
production levels in other developed areas of the field have not been affected 
at this time  we are not working interest owners in the holt bryant unit of the delhi field and therefore are not bearing any cash costs of the remediation  the amount of which the operator has recently estimated to be a minimum of million 
however  revenues to our royalty interest are being temporarily impacted by the reduction in oil production in the affected area  and the impact is expected to continue into our second quarter of fiscal an increase in lease operating costs due to the remediation  to the extent not covered by the operator indemnity of us and contractually assumed obligations  net of any associated insurance reimbursements  are currently expected to delay the date that our reversionary working interest becomes effective 
the extent of the delay is uncertain and also depends upon other variables including the temporary reduction in purchased co volumes and oil prices 
we have no current expectation that ultimate field recoveries and reserves at delhi will be materially impacted  and our current reserves as of june  include the expected impact of this event based on an assumed reversion date 
we are continuing to monitor the field operations in our limited role as a non working interest royalty owner 
to date  the operator has reported expending million on the project to complete four of six planned phases and associated pipeline and infrastructure construction 
our reversion  however  is 
table of contents based solely on our deemed million reversionary payout amount 
until reversion  our net production is being realized from our royalty interest that is free and clear of all cost  except for a pipeline transportation tariff of approximately per barrel 
our realized oil price at delhi tracks louisiana light sweet oil price  which has been similarly tracking brent crude oil price during fiscal as a result  our average realized price for the year at delhi was per barrel 
mississippi lime north central oklahoma  kay county in april  we entered the mississippi lime play east of the nemaha ridge in north central oklahoma through a joint venture jv with a private company based in tulsa  oklahoma 
our position is in kay county  where the mississippian lime formation is well defined  but not substantially depleted  by previous vertical development  and the area historically has shown higher oil content 
the jv plans to redevelop this play with horizontal drilling and staged fracturing technology 
the jv  operated by our partner  owns approximately  net acres within a footprint of approximately  gross acres 
during fiscal  the operator completed the first two gross 
net producer wells on our acreage 
following more than six months of high fluid production  but substantially less than expected oil and gas production  we completed a study of recent wells in the area offsetting our leasehold to potentially identify differentiating characteristics between successful and unsuccessful 
that study concluded that successful horizontal wells were typically completed high in the formation  and unsuccessful wells were typically completed in the lower part of the formation 
with the jv initial two evaluation wells having been drilled in the middle of the formation  the partners agreed to production test a recompletion high in the vertical part of one jv well 
this work is currently underway 
also during fiscal  we elected to sell back to the jv operator a portion of our interest totaling  net acres in exchange for the liquidation of our remaining million carry obligation 
as a result  our net property account and our accounts payable were reduced by million 
consequently  our jv interest in all undrilled sections decreased to 
at june   our independent reservoir engineers  pinnacle energy services  llc  assigned probable undeveloped reserves totaling million boe  net to our interest  with a pv of million 
these reserves represent an approximate rd reduction in recovery per drilling location compared to the reserves report of june   and the reduction is based on the results of our first two evaluation wells and results of drilling in the area by other operators 
the million boe of probable reserves compares to million boe  with a pv of million at june  the estimated reserves are black oil and liquids rich natural gas 
our reserves are derived from  net acres to our interest across gross drilling locations on acre spacing  or three locations for each acre section 
on this basis  full development costs are estimated to be million  net to our interest  or per net boe 
we are developing the leasehold initially on acre spacing based on current industry expectations 
garp during  we installed our garp technology on three wells  one pursuant to each of two commercialization agreements in place and one installation in a well we acquired 
all three tests were completed with good results  but one installation under a commercialization agreement was subsequently watered out due to an offset well being hydraulically fractured by another operator 
in the other two wells  we were able to significantly increase production and reserves while substantially extending the economic lives and retaining leases 
due to the success to date  we are now in final discussions to expand the application of garp to a larger group of wells 

table of contents giddings field central texas during fiscal  we divested of the bulk of our nongarp giddings field assets 
as part of the divestment  we retained an approximate overriding royalty interest on  acres on all depths below the base of the austin chalk and also have the right to receive a spud fee of  per proved drilling location divested 
in a fiscal farmout  we retained our approximate overriding royalty interests in the woodbine formation on net acres and our back in working interest on approximately net acres in grimes county  texas lopez field south texas during fiscal  we drilled and completed a producer well and a salt water injection well 
both of these wells are currently shut in 
the two producers drilled and completed the previous year yielded the expected level of oil production during the year  and our independent reservoir engineer  von gonten  assigned proved developed reserves of mbo with pv of million and mbo of proved undeveloped reserves with pv of million to six drilling locations 
he further assigned probable reserves of mbo to drilling locations with pv of million 
while our development activity in the lopez field confirmed the potential of our concept  the time and effort required to achieve reserves has lowered the attractiveness of the potential 
consequently  we elected to begin a monetization process of this asset during fiscal and expect that process to be completed in early fiscal operations fiscal net income increased to million  a million increase over fiscal net income of million 
revenues increased to million  compared to million in fiscal the revenue increase was due to a boe increase in sales volumes to mboe and a increase in realized prices that averaged per boe 
delhi was the largest contributor to revenue growth due to its sales volume increase that was partly offset by a decrease in realized average prices to per bo 
we realized million in proceeds by monetizing non core giddings properties during fiscal comparing this year performance of properties sold this year to fiscal  revenue was million lower and volumes were  lower 
operating costs  including loe  production tax  dd a and g a  increased to million  up over fiscal on a boe basis to per boe 
the key driver to the million increase was a million increase in g a expense  reflecting higher legal expense  bonus  salary and benefits  compliance costs and property sale transaction fees 
non cash  stock based compensation expense of million comprised of general and administrative expense for fiscal non cash  stock based compensation expense remains an important part of our total compensation program  as a small company in competition for talented staff with numerous  more established other companies  to help motivate and retain high performing employees and consultants  in addition to conserving our cash resources 
for further details  see results of operations below 
finances working capital more than doubled to million  compared to million at june  at june   working capital included million of cash 
the million increase in working capital since june  was due primarily to million increase in balance sheet cash  a million increase in all other current assets and a million reduction in 
table of contents current liabilities due to a million decline in joint venture payables  partially offset by an aggregate million increase from all other current liabilities 
cash flows from operations covered our general and administrative expenses and all of our capital expenditures 
operating cash flow was million and cash capital expenditures were million 
we added an unsecured standby credit facility in the amount of million  none of which has been drawn down as of the date of this filing 
we remained debt free 
all of our expenditures were funded solely by working capital and we ended our fiscal year with no funded debt 
looking forward into fiscal capital budget our capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be at least million across our three core assets 
delhi field we expect our net capital expenditures in delhi to approximate million for the roll out of the next phase of the co project  assuming reversion of our working interest occurs by january  we further expect that cash flows from the working interest will be in excess of the net capital expenditures expected 
mississippian lime further capital expenditures will be subject to success in the currently active recompletion test of one well and  if successful  drilling results of the anticipated third evaluation well 
in addition  our capital expenditures will be impacted by the level of participation by our jv partner and our ability to bring in another partner if the jv operator is unable to participate 
each well is expected to cost approximately million on a working interest basis 
garp capital expenditures are subject to the number of installations pursuant to an agreement currently being finalized  and any other commercialization agreements entered into 
at this time  our expectation is for capital expenditures to be at least million  and could reach or exceed million 
realizing shareholder value the board of directors and management continue to be highly focused on creating value for shareholders and delivering that value to shareholder in an efficient and timely manner 
consequently  we are regularly reviewing potential acquisitions  new projects  dividends  and other opportunities 
as part of that effort  we renewed our form s shelf registration and expanded its capacity to million in order to increase our financial flexibility and options 
continued improvement in financial results  through increasing production and revenues 
liquidity and capital resources at june   our working capital was million compared to million at june  the million increase in working capital since june   was due primarily to increased cash of million together with a million reduction in current liabilities reflecting a million decrease in joint venture payables partially offset by an aggregate increase in other current liability items

our depletion rate decreased significantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  when we first recorded reserves at delhi of million proved oil reserves with associated legacy costs of only million transferred to our full cost pool 
inflation 
although the general inflation rate in the united states  as measured by the consumer price index and the producer price index  has been relatively low in recent years  the oil and gas industry has experienced unusually volatile price movements in commodity prices  vendor goods and oilfield services 
prices for drilling and oilfield services  oilfield equipment  tubulars  labor  expertise and other services greatly impact our lease operating expenses and our capital expenditures 
during fiscal  we saw modest increases in drilling and oilfield services costs over prior years 
product prices  operating costs and development costs may not always move in tandem 

table of contents known trends and uncertainties 
general worldwide economic conditions continue to be uncertain and volatile 
concerns over uncertain future economic growth are affecting numerous industries  companies  as well as consumers  which impact demand for crude oil and natural gas 
if demand decreases in the future  it may put downward pressure on crude oil and natural gas prices  thereby lowering our revenues and working capital going forward 
in addition  our lease operating expenses and their percentage of our revenues are likely to increase as our working interest production increases at our mississippian lime play  reversion of our back interest at delhi or other additions to our working interest production that would dilute extraordinary margins we have enjoyed from our mineral and overriding royalty interests at delhi 
seasonality 
our business is generally not directly seasonal  except for instances when weather conditions may adversely affect access to our properties or delivery of our petroleum products 
although we do not generally modify our production for changes in market demand  we do experience seasonality in the product prices we receive  driven by summer cooling and driving  winter heating  and extremes in seasonal weather including hurricanes that may substantially affect oil and natural gas production and imports 
contractual obligations and other commitments the table below provides estimates of the timing of future payments that  as of june   we are obligated to make under our contractual obligations and commitments 
we expect to fund these contractual obligations with cash on hand and cash generated from operations 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years contractual obligations operating lease other obligations asset retirement obligations total obligations critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that we select certain accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these policies  together with our estimates have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
following is a discussion of our most critical accounting estimates  judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
oil and natural gas properties 
companies engaged in the production of oil and natural gas are required to follow accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry 
we apply the full cost accounting method for our oil and natural gas properties as prescribed by sec regulation s x rule under this method of accounting  the costs of unsuccessful  as well as successful  exploration and development activities are capitalized as properties and equipment 
this includes any internal costs that are directly related to property acquisition  exploration and development activities but does not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties is not recognized  unless the gain or loss would 
table of contents significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves 
oil and natural gas properties include costs that are excluded from costs being depleted or amortized 
oil and natural gas property costs excluded represent investments in unevaluated properties and include non producing leasehold  geological and geophysical costs associated with leasehold or drilling interests and exploration drilling costs 
we exclude these costs until the property has been evaluated 
costs are transferred to the full cost pool as the properties are evaluated 
as of june   our total unevaluated costs were million  all of which was associated with our mississippi lime leasehold position in north central oklahoma 
if these costs were evaluated and included in our full cost pool  with no increases in our proved reserves as of june   our depreciation  depletion and amortization expense would have increased by approximately  estimates of proved reserves 
the estimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves have a significant impact on the underlying financial statements 
the estimated quantities of proved reserves are used to calculate depletion expense  and the estimated future net cash flows associated with those proved reserves is the basis in determining impairment under the quarterly ceiling test calculation 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is very complex  requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
estimated reserves are often subject to future revisions  which could be substantial  based on the availability of additional information  including reservoir performance  additional development activity  new geological and geophysical data  additional drilling  technological advancements  price changes and other economic factors 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that the reported reserve estimates represent the most accurate assessments possible  including the hiring of independent engineers to prepare our reserve estimates  the subjective decisions and variances in available data for the properties make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in our financial statements 
material revisions to reserve estimates and or significant changes in commodity prices could substantially affect our estimated future net cash flows of our proved reserves  affecting our quarterly ceiling test calculation and could significantly affect our depletion rate 
a decrease in commodity prices used to determine our proved reserves and standardized measure as of june   would not have resulted in an impairment of our oil and natural gas properties 
holding all other factors constant  a reduction in the company proved reserve estimate at june  of  and would affect depreciation  depletion and amortization expense by approximately   and  respectively 
on december   the sec issued its final rule on the modernization of reporting oil and gas reserves 
the new rule allows consideration of new technologies in evaluating reserves  allows companies to disclose their probable and possible reserves to investors  requires reporting of oil and gas reserves using an average price based on the previous month unweighted arithmetic average first day of the month price rather than year end prices  revises the disclosure requirements for oil and gas operations  and revises accounting for the limitation on capitalized costs for full cost companies 
the rule did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
we make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes 
our federal and state income tax returns are generally not prepared or filed before the consolidated financial statements are prepared or filed  therefore  we estimate the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at the end of each period as well as the effects of tax rate changes  tax credits  and net operating loss carry backs and carry forwards 
adjustments related to these estimates are recorded in our tax provision in the period in which we file our income tax returns 
further  we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover or utilize our deferred tax assets primarily our net operating loss 
if recovery is not likely  we must record a 
table of contents valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets for the amount we would not expect to recover  which would result in an increase to our income tax expense 
as of june   we have recorded a valuation allowance for the portion of our net operating loss that is limited by irs section management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making the assessment of the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods for which the deferred tax assets are deductible  as of end of the current fiscal year  we believe that it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of its net deferred tax assets 
if our estimates and judgments change regarding our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period it is determined that recovery is not probable 
stock based compensation 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
this valuation method requires the input of certain assumptions  including expected stock price volatility  expected term of the award  the expected risk free interest rate  and the expected dividend yield of the company stock 
the risk free interest rate used is the us treasury yield for bonds matching the expected term of the option on the date of grant 
our dividend yield is zero  as we do not pay a dividend 
because of our limited trading experience of our common stock and limited exercise history of our stock option awards  estimating the volatility and expected term is very subjective 
we base our estimate of our expected future volatility  on peer companies whose common stock has been trading longer than ours  along with our own limited trading history while operating as an oil and natural gas producer 
future estimates of our stock volatility could be substantially different from our current estimate  which could significantly affect the amount of expense we recognize for our stock based compensation awards 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements as of june  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
commodity price risk our most significant market risk is the pricing for crude oil  natural gas and ngls 
we expect energy prices to remain volatile and unpredictable 
if energy prices decline significantly  revenues and cash flow would significantly decline 
in addition  a non cash write down of our oil and gas properties could be required under full cost accounting rules if future oil and gas commodity prices sustained a significant decline 
prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital  as  if and when needed 
although our current production base may not be sufficient enough to effectively allow hedging  we may use derivative instruments to hedge our commodity price risk
