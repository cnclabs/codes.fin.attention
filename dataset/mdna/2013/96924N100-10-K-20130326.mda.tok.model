item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a provider of professional technical and consulting services to public agencies at all levels of government  public and private utilities  and commercial and industrial firms 
we enable these entities to provide a wide range of specialized services without having to incur and maintain the overhead necessary to develop staffing in house 
we assist our clients with a broad range of complementary services relating to engineering and planning  energy efficiency and sustainability  economic and financial consulting  and national preparedness and interoperability 
we operate our business through a network of offices located primarily in california and new york 
we also have operations in arizona  florida  texas  washington and washington  dc 
as of december   we had a staff of which includes licensed engineers and other professionals 
historically  our clients have primarily been public agencies in communities with populations ranging from  to  people 
we believe communities of this size are underserved by large outsourcing companies that tend to focus on securing large federal and state projects  as well as projects for the private sector 
recently  we have begun to provide increased services to public and private utilities that service major metropolitan communities and commercial and industrial firms  particularly in connection with the growth of our energy efficiency and sustainability services 
we seek to establish close working relationships with our clients and expand the breadth and depth of the services we provide to them over time 
while we currently serve communities throughout the country  our business with public agencies is concentrated in california and arizona 
we provide services to approximately of the cities and approximately of the counties in california 
we also serve special districts  school districts  a range of public agencies and private industry 
our business with public and private utilities is concentrated in california and new york 
we were founded in and willdan group  inc  a delaware corporation  was formed in to serve as our holding company 
we consist of a family of wholly owned companies that operate within the following segments for financial reporting purposes engineering services 
our engineering services segment includes the operations of our subsidiaries  willdan engineering and public agency resources pars 
willdan engineering provides civil engineering related and city planning services to our clients 
pars primarily provides staffing to willdan engineering 
contract revenue for the engineering services segment represented approximately and of our overall consolidated contract revenue for fiscal years and  respectively 
energy efficiency services 
our energy efficiency services segment consists of the business of our subsidiary  willdan energy solutions  which offers energy efficiency and sustainability consulting services to utilities  public agencies and private industry 
this segment is currently our largest segment based on contract revenue  representing approximately and of our consolidated contract revenue for fiscal years and  respectively 
public finance services 
our public finance services segment consists of the business of our subsidiary  willdan financial services  which offers economic and financial consulting services to public agencies 
contract revenue for the public finance services segment represented 
table of contents approximately and of our consolidated contract revenue for fiscal years and  respectively 
homeland security services 
our homeland security services segment consists of the business of our subsidiary  willdan homeland solutions  which offers national preparedness and interoperability services and communications and technology solutions 
contract revenue for our homeland security services segment represented approximately and of our consolidated contract revenue for fiscal years and  respectively 
in fiscal and  general economic conditions declined due to a number of factors including slower economic activity  a lack of available credit  decreased consumer confidence and reduced corporate profits and capital spending  leading to a slowdown in construction  particularly residential housing construction  in the western united states 
as a result of this slowdown  both our engineering services segment and public finance services segment suffered declines in revenue and operating margin compression 
while economic conditions improved from fiscal through  the recovery has been slow  particularly with regard to our traditional engineering services and public finance services 
while our profitability increased in fiscal and as a result of increased revenue from our energy efficiency services segment  our profitability in fiscal was severely impacted by a goodwill impairment charge related to that segment 
revolving credit facility 
as of december   we breached the net income covenant under our credit agreement with wells fargo because we did not have net income of at least  measured on a rolling four quarter basis and we sustained net losses during two consecutive quarters in the past year 
additionally  our ratio of total funded debt to ebitda exceeds the limit permitted under the credit agreement 
because of these covenant breaches  our ability to borrow additional funds under the credit agreement is subject to wells fargo discretion and wells fargo could choose to increase the interest rate by  make the loans outstanding under the credit agreement immediately due and payable  and or terminate its commitments to us under the credit agreement 
although we are seeking a waiver for these covenant breaches and extend the maturity of the facility  wells fargo is not obligated to provide any waiver for current or future covenant breaches or modify the terms of the credit agreement 
in addition  the revolving credit agreement is scheduled to expire on april  wells fargo may also refuse to renew the facility when it expires on april   and if they do so  we will have to repay the outstanding balance of million

impairment charges 
in fiscal  we determined that a quantitative assessment of our goodwill was warranted for the energy solutions reporting unit 
this assessment indicated that the estimated fair value of such reporting unit was less than its carrying value 
for this testing  we weighted the income approach and the market approach at and  respectively 
we further determined that all of the remaining goodwill for the energy solutions reporting unit was impaired and recognized an impairment charge of million 
components of income and expense contract revenue we provide our services under contracts  purchase orders or retainer letters 
the contracts we enter into with our clients contain three principal types of pricing provisions time and materials  unit based  and fixed price 
revenue on our time and materials and unit based contracts are recognized as the work is performed in accordance with specific terms of the contract 
approximately of our contracts are based on contractual rates per hour plus costs incurred 
some of these contracts include maximum contract prices  but the majority of these contracts are not expected to exceed the maximum 
contract revenue on our fixed price contracts is determined on the percentage of completion method based generally on the ratio of direct costs incurred to date to estimated total direct costs at 
table of contents completion 
many of our fixed price contracts are relatively short in duration  thereby lowering the risks of not properly estimating the percent complete 
adjustments to contract cost estimates are made in the periods in which the facts requiring such revisions become known 
when the revised estimate indicates a loss  such loss is recognized currently in its entirety 
claims revenue is recognized only upon resolution of the claim 
change orders in dispute are evaluated as claims 
costs related to un priced change orders are expensed when incurred and recognition of the related contract revenue is based on an evaluation of the probability of recovery of the costs 
estimated profit is recognized for un priced change orders if realization of the expected price of the change order is probable 
our contracts come up for renewal periodically and at the time of renewal may be subject to renegotiation  which could impact the profitability on that contract 
in addition  during the term of a contract  public agencies may request additional or revised services which may impact the economics of the transaction 
most of our contracts permit our clients  with prior notice  to terminate the contracts at any time without cause 
while we have a large volume of transactions  the renewal  termination or modification of a contract  in particular our contract with consolidated edison  may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operations 
direct costs of contract revenue direct costs of contract revenue consist primarily of subconsultant services and that portion of technical and nontechnical salaries and wages that have been incurred in connection with revenue producing projects 
direct costs of contract revenue also include production expenses and other expenses that are incurred in connection with revenue producing projects 
direct costs of contract revenue generally exclude depreciation and amortization  that portion of technical and nontechnical salaries and wages related to marketing efforts  vacations  holidays and other time not spent directly generating revenue under existing contracts 
such costs are included in general and administrative expenses 
additionally  payroll taxes  bonuses and employee benefit costs for all of our personnel are included in general and administrative expenses since no allocation of these costs is made to direct costs of contract revenue 
no allocation of facilities costs is made to direct costs of contract revenue nor is depreciation and amortization allocated to direct costs 
we expense direct costs of contract revenue when incurred 
as a firm that provides multiple and diverse services  we do not believe gross margin is a consistent or appropriate indicator of our performance and therefore we do not use this measure as construction contractors and other types of consulting firms may 
other companies may classify as direct costs of contract revenue some of the costs that we classify as general and administrative expenses 
as a result  our direct costs of contract revenue may not be comparable to direct costs for other companies  either as a line item expense or as a percentage of contract revenue 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include the costs of the marketing and support staffs  other marketing expenses  management and administrative personnel costs  payroll taxes  bonuses and employee benefits for all of our employees and the portion of salaries and wages not allocated to direct costs of contract revenue for those employees who provide our services 
general and administrative expenses also include facility costs  depreciation and amortization  professional services  legal and accounting fees and administrative operating costs 
within general and administrative expenses  other includes expenses such as provision for billed or unbilled receivables  professional services  legal and accounting  computer costs  travel and entertainment and marketing costs 
we expense general and administrative costs when incurred 

table of contents critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us  or gaap 
to prepare these financial statements in conformity with gaap  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses in the reporting period 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we describe below those accounting policies that require material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
our management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis  based upon information currently available and on various assumptions management believes are reasonable as of the date of this report 
contract accounting applying the percentage of completion method of recognizing revenue requires us to estimate the outcome of our long term contracts 
we forecast such outcomes to the best of our knowledge and belief of current and expected conditions and our expected course of action 
differences between our estimates and actual results often occur resulting in changes to reported revenue and earnings 
such changes could have a material effect on our future consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful accounts based upon our review of all outstanding amounts on a monthly basis 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts by identifying troubled accounts and by using historical experience applied to an aging of accounts 
our credit risk is minimal with governmental entities 
accounts receivable are written off when deemed uncollectible 
recoveries of accounts receivable previously written off are recorded when received 
for further information on the types of contracts under which we perform our services  see business contract structure elsewhere in this report 
goodwill we test our goodwill at least annually for possible impairment 
we complete our annual testing of goodwill as of the last day of the first month of our fourth fiscal quarter each year to determine whether there is impairment 
in addition to our annual test  we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that may indicate a potential impairment of goodwill 
we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million related to our energy solutions reporting unit during fiscal following this impairment charge  none of our reporting units had any goodwill remaining 
we did not recognize any goodwill impairment charges in fiscal years or we test our goodwill for impairment at the level of our reporting units  which are components of our operating segments 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 
asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
this accounting guidance allows companies to perform a qualitative assessment on goodwill impairment to determine whether a quantitative assessment is necessary 
the guidance is for goodwill impairment tests performed in interim and annual periods for fiscal years beginning after december  the process of testing goodwill for impairment  pursuant to asu  now involves an optional qualitative assessment on goodwill impairment of our reporting units to determine whether a quantitative assessment is necessary 
if a quantitative assessment is warranted  we then determine the fair value of the applicable reporting units 
to estimate the fair value of our reporting units  we use both an income approach based on management estimates of future cash flows and other market data and a market approach based upon multiples of 
table of contents ebitda earned by similar public companies 
for our annual impairment testing in fiscal  we weighted the income approach and the market approach at and  respectively 
the income approach was given a higher weight because it has a more direct correlation to the specific economics of the reporting units than the market approach  which is based on multiples of public companies that  although comparable  may not provide the same mix of services as our reporting units 
once the fair value is determined  we then compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is determined to be less than the carrying value  we perform an additional assessment to determine the extent of the impairment based on the implied fair value of goodwill compared with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
in the event that the current implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value  an impairment charge is recognized 
inherent in such fair value determinations are significant judgments and estimates  including but not limited to assumptions about our future revenue  profitability and cash flows  our operational plans and our interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations 
to the extent these assumptions are incorrect or economic conditions that would impact the future operations of our reporting units change  any goodwill may be deemed to be impaired  and an impairment charge could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operation 
during the second quarter of  we determined that a quantitative assessment of our goodwill was warranted for the energy solutions reporting unit 
this assessment indicated that the estimated fair value of such reporting unit was less than its carrying value 
for this testing  we weighted the income approach and the market approach at and  respectively 
we further determined that all of the remaining goodwill for the energy solutions reporting unit was impaired and recognized an impairment charge of million 
accounting for claims against the company we accrue an undiscounted liability related to claims against us for which the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
we disclose the amount accrued and an estimate of any reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued  if such disclosure is necessary for our financial statements not to be misleading 
we do not accrue liabilities related to claims when the likelihood that a loss has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated  or when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote 
losses related to recorded claims are included in general and administrative expenses 
determining probability and estimating claim amounts is highly judgmental 
initial accruals and any subsequent changes in our estimates could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and tax basis of our assets and liabilities  subject to a judgmental assessment of recoverability of deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
we recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefit is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 
table of contents likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense

salaries and wages as a percentage of contract revenue remained relatively constant in the period as compared to the period 
subconsultant services and other direct costs increased to of contract revenue for the fiscal year ended december  from of contract revenue for the fiscal year ended december  subconsultant costs declined because of a reduction in activity within our energy efficiency services segment as a result of delays in the renewal of contracts for the provision of energy efficiency related projects 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended december  from million for the fiscal year ended december  this was due primarily to an increase of million in the general and administrative expenses of the energy efficiency services segment  partially offset by decreases of million  million and million in the general and administrative expenses of the engineering services  public finance services and homeland security services segments  respectively 
unallocated corporate expenses decreased by million 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of contract revenue increased to for the fiscal year ended december  from for the fiscal year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses primarily resulted from a million goodwill impairment charge we recognized relating to our energy efficiency services segment

income tax benefit expense 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million for the fiscal year ended december   as compared to an income tax expense of million for the fiscal year ended december  the income tax benefit is attributable to the million of goodwill impairment included in our pretax loss for the fiscal year ended december   offset by a valuation allowance of million due to the uncertainty of realization of net deferred tax assets after the reduction of deferred tax liabilities associated with the goodwill impairment 
the effective tax rates for the fiscal year ended december  differ from the us tax statutory rate of primarily due to state income tax rates  permanent items that are not deductible for us tax purposes  and the establishment of the valuation allowance during the fiscal year ended december  for further discussion of our income tax provision  see note income taxes of notes to our consolidated financial statements

a 
table of contents source of revenue in our engineering services segment is fees assessed for building permits 
since the second half of fiscal  we have experienced reductions in revenue from these fees because of the slowdown in residential construction in the western united states  and a decline in our other building and safety projects which is both directly and indirectly affected by the housing market 
revenue in the homeland security services segment increased due to an increase in demand for our traditional and expanded homeland security  management consulting and public safety consulting services 
our homeland security services segment has expanded its service offerings beyond its traditional planning  training and exercise services to include public safety and interoperability communications and management consulting 
revenue in the public finance services segment decreased primarily due to lower levels of activity in the financial consulting business as a result of the general downturn in macro economic conditions

net income 
as a result of the above factors  our net income was million for the fiscal year ended december   compared to net income of million for the fiscal year ended december  liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents 
our primary source of liquidity is cash generated from operations 
we also have a revolving line of credit with wells fargo  which matures on april   but our ability to borrow funds under this line of credit is currently subject to wells fargo discretion 
while we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash generated by operating activities will be sufficient to finance our operating activities for at least the next months  without borrowings from our revolving credit facility  if we do experience a cash flow shortage  we may have difficulty obtaining additional funds on favorable terms  if at all  in order to meet obligations as they come due in the normal course of business 
cash flows from operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities were million for fiscal year compared to cash flows used in operating activities of million in fiscal year and cash flows provided by operating activities of million for fiscal year our cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal year were higher than in fiscal despite lower contract revenue due primarily to decreases in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and accounts receivable  and an increase in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts 
these items were partially offset by decreases in accrued liabilities and accounts payable 
our cash flows used in operating activities in fiscal year primarily resulted from increases in accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
our cash flows from operating activities were also reduced by non cash revenue of million from a subcontractor settlement in fiscal year the cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal were due primarily to increases in

aside from payments for business acquisitions  our cash used in investing activities primarily related to the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements 
cash flows from financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities in fiscal were million as compared to million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year the net cash flows provided by financing activities in fiscal were primarily attributable to borrowings under our revolving line of credit  partially offset by repayments of our revolving line of credit and changes in the excess of outstanding checks over bank balance 
the net cash flows provided by financing activities in fiscal were primarily attributable to changes in the excess of outstanding checks over bank balance and proceeds from notes payable  partially offset by repayments of our revolving line of credit 
the net cash flows provided by financing activities in fiscal were primarily attributable to changes in the excess of outstanding checks over bank balance 
outstanding indebtedness we currently have a revolving credit agreement with wells fargo  which was entered into on december  and became effective as of january  the credit agreement replaced our prior credit facility with wells fargo that expired on january  there were million of outstanding borrowings under this agreement as of december  we have also financed  from time to time  insurance premiums by entering into unsecured notes payable with insurance companies 
during our annual insurance renewals in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended december   we elected to finance our insurance premiums for the upcoming fiscal year 
our credit agreement with wells fargo provides for a million revolving line of credit  including a million standby letter of credit sub facility  and matures on april  loans made under the revolving line of credit will accrue interest at either i a floating rate equal to the prime rate in effect from time to time or ii a fixed rate of above libor  with the interest rate to be selected by us 
borrowings under the revolving line of credit are guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries except public agency resources the guarantors and secured by all of our and the guarantors accounts receivable and other rights to payment  general intangibles  inventory and equipment 
pursuant to the credit agreement  we also must pay a fee on unused commitments and customary fees on any letters of credit drawn under the facility 
the credit agreement contains customary representations and affirmative covenants  including financial covenants that require us to maintain i net income after taxes of at least  measured on a rolling four quarter basis  without losses in two consecutive quarters  ii a maximum ratio of total funded debt measured as the sum of all obligations for borrowed money  including subordinated debt  plus all capital lease obligations to ebitda of to  measured quarterly on a rolling four quarter basis  and iii a minimum asset coverage ratio of to as of each quarter end  measured as unrestricted cash plus net billed accounts receivables divided by amounts outstanding and issued letters of credit under the revolving line of credit 

table of contents the credit agreement also includes customary negative covenants  including i restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness by us or the guarantors other than purchase money indebtedness not to exceed million and indebtedness existing on the date of the credit agreement  ii restrictions on the payment of dividends on our stock and redemptions  repurchases or other acquisitions of our stock  except that we can repurchase stock with an aggregate fair market value up to million in any calendar year  and iii limitations on asset sales  mergers and acquisitions 
in addition  the credit agreement includes customary events of default 
as of december   we breached the net income covenant under the credit agreement because we did not have net income of at least  measured on a rolling four quarter basis and we sustained net losses during two consecutive quarters in the past year 
additionally  our ratio of total funded debt to ebitda exceeds the limit permitted under the credit agreement 
because of these covenant breaches  our ability to borrow additional funds under the credit agreement is currently subject to wells fargo discretion and wells fargo could choose to increase the interest rate by  make the loans outstanding under the credit agreement immediately due and payable  and or terminate its commitments to us under the credit agreement 
although we are seeking a waiver for these covenant breaches and to extend the maturity of the line of credit  wells fargo is not obligated to provide any waiver for current or future covenant breaches or modify the terms of the credit agreement 
wells fargo may also refuse to renew the facility when it expires on april   and if they do so  we will have to repay the outstanding balance of million 
if we do not maintain a ratio of total funded debt to ebitda of or lower  determined on a rolling four quarter basis  wells fargo may choose to increase the interest rate of our outstanding indebtedness  make any loans outstanding under the credit agreement immediately due and payable and will no longer be obligated to extend further credit to us 
management therefore believes that presentation of total funded debt to ebitda is useful to investors because it helps them understand how our total funded debt to ebitda compares to the financial covenant contained in our credit agreement and whether we have violated or are close to violating such covenant 
management also reviews the ratio of total funded debt to ebitda  along with the other financial covenants contained in our credit agreement  to ensure it will continue to have access to its financing sources 
total funded debt is defined as the sum of all obligations for borrowed money including subordinated debt plus all capital lease obligations  and ebitda is defined as net profit before tax plus interest expense net of capitalized interest expense  depreciation expense and amortization expense 
as a result of the definition of total funded debt in our credit agreement  total funded debt represents our total borrowings under our line of credit  letters of credit  notes payable and capital lease obligations as of december  these definitions may differ from those of other companies reporting similarly named measures 
these measures should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap
