item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations include the identification of certain trends and other statements that may predict or anticipate future business or financial results 
there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated 
see risk factors in item a of this annual report on form k 
business overview the company we are a biotechnology company specializing in the structural characterization  process engineering and biologic systems analysis of complex molecules such as polysaccharides  polypeptides and biologics including proteins and antibodies 
our initial technology was built on the ability to characterize complex polysaccharides 
over the last decade  we have expanded our expertise into technologies that enable us to develop a diversified product portfolio of complex generic  biosimilars and novel products 
our business strategy has been to develop both generic and novel products  and we are working with collaborators to develop and commercialize our complex generics and biosimilars 
this strategy was validated by the marketing approval and commercial launch of enoxaparin sodium injection  a generic version of lovenox  in july since its launch through december   we have recorded enoxaparin sodium injection product revenues of approximately million  driven primarily by its initial status as a sole generic 
we believe that our scientific capabilities  engineering approaches  intellectual property and regulatory strategies  and synergistic business model position us to develop and commercialize competitively differentiated products in our target areas of complex generics  biosimilars and novel products 
our programs our complex generics programs target marketed products that were originally approved by the united states food and drug administration  or fda  as new drug applications  or ndas 
therefore  we have been able to access the existing j generic regulatory pathway and have submitted abbreviated new drug applications  or andas  for these products 
our first commercial product  enoxaparin sodium injection  which has been developed and commercialized in collaboration with sandoz inc and sandoz ag  collectively sandoz  affiliates of novartis ag  received fda marketing approval in july as a generic version of lovenox enoxaparin sodium injection 
lovenox is a complex mixture of polysaccharide chains derived from naturally sourced heparin which is used to prevent and treat deep vein thrombosis  or dvt  and to support the treatment of acute coronary syndromes  or acs 
the enoxaparin sodium injection anda submitted by sandoz was the first anda for a generic lovenox to be approved by fda  validating our novel approaches to the structural characterization  process engineering and biologic systems analysis of complex molecules 
from july through early october  the enoxaparin sodium injection marketed by sandoz was the sole generic version of lovenox  and consequently  under the terms of our collaborative agreement with sandoz  we earned a substantial profit share on sandoz sales of enoxaparin sodium injection 
the product now faces other generic competitors and we receive a royalty on net sales  which have been significantly eroded by competitive pressures 
our second complex generic product candidate  m  is designed to be a generic version of copaxone glatiramer acetate injection  a drug that is indicated for the reduction of the frequency of relapses in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis  or rrms 
copaxone consists of a synthetic mixture of polypeptide chains 
with m  we extended our core polysaccharide characterization and process engineering capabilities to develop capabilities for the structural characterization  process engineering and biologic systems analysis of this complex polypeptide mixture 

table of contents we are also collaborating with sandoz to develop and commercialize m  and the sandoz anda for m is currently under fda review 
our biosimilars program is targeted toward developing biosimilar versions of marketed therapeutic proteins  with a goal of obtaining fda designation as interchangeable 
the subset of biosimilars receiving an interchangeability designation are known as interchangeable biologics 
in march  an abbreviated regulatory process was codified in section k of the patient protection and affordable care act of this new pathway opens the market for biosimilar and interchangeable versions of a broad array of biologic therapeutics  including antibodies  cytokines  fusion proteins  hormones and blood factors 
forecasters predict a rapidly growing multi billion dollar global market for these products 
most of these biologics are complex mixtures  and for several years we have been investing in developing novel approaches to the structural characterization  process engineering and analysis of the biologic activities of these products 
in february  fda released three documents containing their preliminary guidelines for applications under the section k pathway 
these guidelines state that fda will use a step wise review that considers the totality of the evidence in determining extent of the clinical development program 
this approach puts a substantial emphasis on structural and functional characterization data in evaluating biosimilar products for approval 
we believe the framework that the fda has outlined in the draft guidance documents aligns with our strategy for biosimilars 
our goal is to engineer biologic products that will show minimal to no structural or functional differences from the reference brand product  thereby justifying a more selective and targeted approach to human clinical testing to support demonstration of interchangeability 
in december  we and baxter international  inc  baxter healthcare corporation and baxter healthcare sa  collectively  baxter  entered into a global collaboration and license agreement  or the baxter agreement  to develop and commercialize up to six biosimilars 
the baxter agreement became effective in february baxter is an established healthcare company with global product development  manufacturing and commercial capabilities 
our novel products program leverages the capabilities and expertise of our complex generics and biosimilars programs to address unmet clinical needs 
our most advanced efforts have been in the area of polysaccharide mixtures 
m  in phase clinical development as a potential anti cancer agent  is a novel heparan sulfate mimetic that binds to multiple growth factors  adhesion molecules and chemokines to inhibit tumor angiogenesis  progression  and metastasis 
in addition to this development candidate  we are also seeking to discover and develop additional novel products 
our goal is to leverage the multi targeting nature of complex mixture molecules to develop novel products which could positively modulate multiple pathways in a disease 
we believe that our core technology platform will enable us to map the critical nodes that regulate complex diseases 
we will then be able to define the optimal therapeutic intervention to target the appropriate nodes 
we have built significant capabilities in biological characterization and engineering of proteins through our biosimilars platform that provide us with the potential to create unique and novel formulations of protein including antibody drug compositions for specific disease indications 
to add to these capabilities  in december we acquired selected assets of virdante pharmaceuticals  inc relating to sialylation technology 
sialic acid is a type of sugar modification on selected proteins that is understood to regulate anti inflammatory and immunomodulatory functions of these proteins 
these assets add to our core ability to modify and engineer protein backbones to precisely regulate biological networks and develop novel biologic product candidates 
we may apply our proprietary sialylation technology to develop a sialylated plasma derived intravenous immunoglobulin  or ivig  product or a recombinant sialylated fc product 
we are investigating both approaches  and expect to have data later this year that will guide our development efforts 

table of contents our collaborations in  we entered into a collaboration and license agreement  or the sandoz collaboration  with sandoz nv and sandoz inc to jointly develop  manufacture and commercialize enoxaparin sodium injection 
sandoz nv later assigned its rights in the sandoz collaboration to sandoz ag  an affiliate of novartis pharma ag 
we refer to sandoz ag and sandoz inc together as sandoz 
in and  we entered into a series of agreements  including a stock purchase agreement and an investor rights agreement  with novartis pharma ag  and a collaboration and license agreement  as amended  or the second sandoz collaboration agreement  with sandoz ag 
together  this series of agreements is referred to as the sandoz collaboration 
under the second sandoz collaboration agreement  we and sandoz ag jointly develop  manufacture and commercialize m in connection with the sandoz collaboration  we sold  shares of common stock to novartis pharma ag at a per share price of the closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq global market was on the date of purchase for an aggregate purchase price of million  resulting in an equity premium of million 
prior to the launch of enoxaparin sodium injection in  the collaboration revenues derived from our sandoz collaboration and sandoz collaboration primarily consisted of amounts earned by us for reimbursement by sandoz of research and development services and development costs 
in july  sandoz began the commercial sale of enoxaparin sodium injection 
the profit share or royalties sandoz is obligated to pay us under the sandoz collaboration differ depending on whether i there are no third party competitors marketing an interchangeable generic version of lovenox  or lovenox equivalent product as defined in the sandoz collaboration  ii a lovenox equivalent product is being marketed by sanofi aventis  which distributes the brand name lovenox  or licensed by sanofi aventis to another company to be sold as a generic drug  both known as authorized generics  or iii there are one or more third party competitors which are not sanofi aventis marketing a lovenox equivalent product 
from july through september  no third party competitor was marketing a lovenox equivalent product  therefore  during that period  sandoz paid us of the contractual profits from the sale of enoxaparin sodium injection 
in september  fda approved the anda for the enoxaparin product of amphastar pharmaceuticals  inc or amphastar 
in october  sandoz confirmed that an authorized generic lovenox equivalent product was being marketed  which meant that sandoz was obligated to pay us a royalty on its net sales of enoxaparin sodium injection until the contractual profits from those net sales in a product year july june reached a certain threshold 
upon the achievement of the contractual profit threshold in december  sandoz was obligated to pay us a profit share for the remainder of the product year 
in january  following the court of appeals for the federal circuit granting a stay of the preliminary injunction previously issued against them by the united states district court  watson pharmaceuticals  inc now actavis  inc  or actavis and amphastar launched their third party competitor enoxaparin product 
consequently  in each product year  for net sales of enoxaparin sodium injection up to a pre defined sales threshold  sandoz is obligated to pay us a royalty on net sales payable at a rate  and for net sales above the sales threshold  payable at a rate 
certain development and legal expenses may reduce the amount of profit share  royalty and milestone payments paid to us by sandoz 
any product liability costs and certain other expenses arising from patent litigation may also reduce the amount of profit share  royalty and milestone payments paid to us by sandoz  but only up to of these amounts due to us from sandoz each quarter 
our contractual share of these development and legal expenses is subject to an annual adjustment at the end of each product year  and ends with the product year ending june the second annual adjustment of million was recorded as a reduction in product revenue in the year ended december  
table of contents in december  we and baxter international  inc  baxter healthcare corporation and baxter healthcare sa  collectively baxter  entered into a global collaboration and license agreement  or the baxter agreement  to develop and commercialize up to six biosimilars 
the baxter agreement became effective in february baxter is an established healthcare company with global product development  manufacturing and commercial capabilities 
to accelerate efforts in the biosimilars space and address this growing global market  we significantly increased the headcount and related operating expenses dedicated to our biosimilars program in and expect this trend to continue in we expect that the increase in operating expenses will be partially offset in future years by revenues from option fees and milestone payments under the baxter agreement  subject to achievement of technical and regulatory criteria 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
to date  we have devoted substantially all of our capital resource expenditures to the research and development of our product candidates 
in the second half of  we began to derive revenue from our profit share on the commercial sale of enoxaparin sodium injection 
due to the launch by actavis and amphastar of their enoxaparin product in january  our enoxaparin product revenue has significantly decreased 
depending on the future outcome of enoxaparin litigation  we may incur annual operating losses over the next several years as we expand our drug commercialization  development and discovery efforts 
additionally  we plan to continue to evaluate possible acquisitions or licensing of rights to additional technologies  products or assets that fit within our growth strategy 
accordingly  we will need to generate significant revenue to return to profitability 
financial operations overview years ended december   and collaboration revenue collaboration revenue includes product revenue and research and development revenue earned under our collaborative arrangements 
product revenue consists of profit share  royalties and commercial milestones earned from sandoz on sales of enoxaparin sodium injection following its commercial launch in july for the year ended december   we earned million in profit share on sandoz net sales of enoxaparin sodium injection of million 
for the year ended december   we earned million in part on a profit share and in part on a royalty on sandoz net sales of enoxaparin sodium injection of billion 
for the year ended december   we earned million in part on a profit share and in part on a royalty on sandoz net sales of enoxaparin sodium injection of million 
the increases in our product revenue of million  or  and sandoz net sales of million  or  from the period to the period are due to a full year of sales in compared with less than six months of sales in due to the july approval and commercial launch 
additionally  in we earned a million commercial milestone on the one year anniversary of fda approval of enoxaparin sodium injection as sole generic 
the decreases in our product revenue of million  or  and sandoz net sales of million  or  from the period to the period are due to a change in the contractual basis of our earned product revenues from profit share to royalty based following the launch of an authorized generic in october and the january launch of a third party competitor generic lovenox  as well as decreased unit sales due to lower market share  as well as lower prices in response to competitor pricing reductions on enoxaparin 
research and development revenue consists of amounts earned by us under the and sandoz collaborations for reimbursement of research and development services and reimbursement of development costs  a regulatory milestone earned by us under the sandoz collaboration  amounts earned by us under the sandoz collaboration for amortization of the equity premium  and amounts earned by us under the baxter agreement for amortization of an upfront payment 
research 
table of contents and development revenue for was million  compared with million for and million for the decrease in research and development revenue of million  or  from the period to the period is primarily due to a decrease in reimbursable manufacturing expenses associated with our m program offset by amortization of the upfront payment from baxter 
the decrease in research and development revenue of million  or  from the period to the period is primarily due to a million regulatory milestone  earned in july upon the fda approval of the enoxaparin sodium injection anda 
we expect research and development revenue earned by us under the and sandoz collaborations will be between million and million per quarter in and we will fully amortize the remaining equity premium of million under the sandoz collaboration in we expect to continue to amortize the million upfront payment from baxter as we deliver research and development services for the two licensed biosimilars  with quarterly amortization of approximately million in there are a number of factors that make it difficult for us to predict the magnitude of future enoxaparin sodium injection product revenue  including the impact of generic competition on the sandoz market share  the pricing of products that compete with enoxaparin sodium injection and other actions taken by our competitors  the inventory levels of enoxaparin sodium injection maintained by wholesalers  distributors and other customers  the frequency of re orders by existing customers and the change in estimates for product reserves 
accordingly  our enoxaparin sodium injection product revenue in previous quarters may not be indicative of future enoxaparin sodium injection product revenue 
the change in sandoz contractual payment terms  along with additional generic competition  has caused and we expect will continue to cause our future product revenue from enoxaparin sodium injection to be significantly reduced compared to revenues earned during the product exclusivity period 
research and development expense research and development expenses consist of costs incurred in identifying  developing and testing product candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  license fees  consulting fees  nonclinical and clinical trial costs  contract research and manufacturing costs  and the costs of laboratory equipment and facilities 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
due to the variability in the length of time necessary to develop a product  the uncertainties related to the estimated cost of the projects and ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization  accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate cost to bring our product candidates to market are not available 
research and development expense for was million  compared with million in and million in the increase of million  or  from the period to the period resulted from increases of million in personnel and related costs associated with our headcount growth to support our programs  million in rent and facility related expenses  principally due to the commencement in the first quarter of of a sublease for additional research and development space  million in laboratory expenses in support of our programs  million in clinical trial expenses associated with our m phase clinical study  million in depreciation and amortization expense primarily due to increased capital expenditures to support our programs  million in process development  manufacturing and third party research costs related to our biosimilars and novel products programs  million in share based compensation expense associated with grants of stock awards to new hires  and million in consulting fees in support of our programs 
these increases were offset by a million in process research and development charge in related to the acquisition of sialylation technology assets 
we expect future research and development expenses to increase in support of our product candidates 

table of contents the increase of million  or  from the period to the period resulted from a million in process research and development charge related to the acquisition of sialylation technology assets and increases of million in research and development facility related expenses  principally due to the facility lease extension for office and laboratory space for an additional term of months  million in personnel and related costs associated with our headcount growth to support our programs  million in process development and third party research costs in support of our novel products program  million in laboratory expenses  million in depreciation and amortization expense primarily due to the amortization related to a milestone payment made during made with respect to our asset purchase from parivid  million in consulting fees related to our m and novel products programs  and million in share based compensation expense principally associated with our employee wide grant of performance based restricted stock 
these increases were offset by a decrease of million in nonclinical costs related to our m program 
the lengthy process of securing fda approval for new drugs requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals would materially adversely affect our product development efforts and our business overall 
accordingly  we cannot currently estimate with any degree of certainty the amount of time or money that we will be required to expend in the future on our product candidates prior to their regulatory approval  if such approval is ever granted 
as a result of these uncertainties surrounding the timing and outcome of any approvals  we are currently unable to estimate when  if ever  our product candidates will generate revenues and cash flows 
the following table summarizes the primary components of our research and development external expenditures  including amortization of our intangible assets  for each of our principal commercial and development programs for the years ended december   and the figures in the table include project expenditures incurred by us and reimbursed by our collaborative partner  but exclude project expenditures incurred by our collaborative partner 
we do not maintain or evaluate  and therefore do not allocate  internal research and development costs on a project by project basis 
consequently  we do not analyze internal research and development costs by project in managing our research and development activities

the january launch of a third party competitor enoxaparin product triggered a change under the terms of our agreement with sandoz in the basis of our product revenue from profit share to a royalty based on net sales of enoxaparin sodium injection 
this competition and the resulting contractual change has had and will continue to have a negative impact on our near term cash generation trend 
we expect that our return to profitability  if at all  will most likely come from the commercialization of our generic copaxone product  which is subject to fda approval and litigation that could delay fda approval 
we expect to finance our current programs and planned operating requirements principally through our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we believe that these funds will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements through at least however  our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and other important factors  and actual results could vary materially 
we may  from time to time  seek additional funding through a combination of new

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
additionally  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet dates 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  accrued expenses and share based payments 
we base our estimates on historical experience  known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with financial accounting standard  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or asc   revenue recognition  which requires that certain criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured

in and  we entered into a series of agreements  including a stock purchase agreement and an investor rights agreement  with novartis pharma ag  and a collaboration and license agreement  as amended  or the second sandoz collaboration agreement  with sandoz ag 
together  this series of agreements is referred to as the sandoz collaboration 
under the second sandoz collaboration agreement  we and sandoz ag expanded the geographic markets for enoxaparin sodium injection covered by the sandoz collaboration to include the european union and we agreed to jointly develop  manufacture and commercialize m in december  we entered into the baxter agreement with baxter related to the development and commercialization of up to six biosimilars 
under the terms of collaboration agreements entered into by us  we have received and may continue to receive non refundable  up front license fees  funding or reimbursement of research and development efforts  license and milestone payments if specified objectives are achieved and or profit sharing or royalties on product sales 
product revenue profit share and or royalty revenue is reported as product revenue and is recognized based upon net sales or profit share of licensed products in licensed territories in the period the sales occur as provided by the collaboration agreement 
these amounts are determined based on amounts provided by the collaboration partner and involve the use of estimates and judgments  such as product sales allowances and accruals related to prompt payment discounts  chargebacks  governmental and other rebates  distributor  wholesaler and group purchasing organizations  or gpo  fees  and product returns  which could be adjusted based on actual results in the future 
research and development revenue we apply the guidance pursuant to fasb accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements topic  for all multiple element arrangements entered into on or after january  and for any multiple element arrangements that were entered into prior to january  but materially modified on or after january  asu no 
amends the guidance on the accounting for arrangements involving the delivery of more than one element and addresses the determination of the unit s of accounting for multiple element arrangements and how the arrangement consideration should be allocated to each unit of accounting 
pursuant to asu no 
 we evaluate each deliverable to determine if it qualifies as a separate unit of accounting 
this determination is generally based on whether the deliverable has stand alone value to the customer 
the arrangement consideration is then allocated to each separate unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of each deliverable 
the estimated selling price of each deliverable is determined using the following hierarchy of values i vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  ii third party evidence of selling price  and iii best estimate of the selling price  or besp 
the besp reflects our best estimate of what the selling price would be if the deliverable was regularly sold on a stand alone basis 
we expect  in general  to use besp for allocating consideration to each deliverable 
in general  the consideration allocated to each unit of accounting is then recognized as the related goods or services are delivered and limited to the consideration not contingent upon future deliverables 
we applied asu no 
to the baxter agreement 
under the sandoz collaboration and the second sandoz collaboration agreement  we have received and may continue to receive consideration in the form of non refundable  upfront fees related to intellectual property rights and licenses  funding or reimbursement of research and development 
table of contents efforts  milestone payments if specified objectives are achieved and profit sharing or royalties on product sales 
we are no longer eligible to receive milestones under the sandoz collaboration because the remaining milestones were contingent upon there being no third party competitors marketing an interchangeable generic version of a lovenox equivalent product 
these multiple element arrangements were entered into prior to january  and have not been materially modified thereafter  therefore we continue to apply our prior accounting policy with respect to the non refundable  upfront license fees and research and development services for these arrangements 
under this prior accounting policy  in general  revenue from non refundable  upfront fees related to intellectual property rights and licenses where we have continuing involvement is recognized ratably over the estimated period of ongoing involvement  which is typically the development term  because there was no objective and reliable evidence of fair value for any undelivered item to allow the delivered item to be considered a separate unit of accounting 
research and development funding is recognized as earned over the period of effort 
under the sandoz collaboration  we have received consideration in the form of milestone payments and under the second sandoz collaboration agreement and the baxter agreement we may receive consideration in the form of milestone payments in future periods 
we apply the guidance pursuant to asu no 
 revenue recognition milestone method  for all sales based  commercial and research and development milestones achieved 
in accordance with asu no 
 at the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments  we evaluate each milestone to determine whether a the milestone can only be achieved based in whole or in part on either i our performance or ii on the occurrence of a specific outcome resulting from our performance  b there is considerable uncertainty at the date the arrangement is entered into that the event will be achieved and c the achievement of the event would result in additional payments being due to us 
additionally  we evaluate whether each milestone is considered substantive 
we designate a milestone as substantive only if it meets all of the following three criteria i the consideration is commensurate with either a our performance to achieve the milestone or b the enhancement of the value of the delivered item s as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone  ii the consideration relates solely to past performance and iii the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement 
we evaluate factors such as the scientific  regulatory  commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone  the level of effort and investment required and whether the milestone consideration is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement in making this assessment 
we have concluded that all of the development and regulatory milestones pursuant to the sandoz collaboration and the second sandoz collaboration agreement are substantive 
we determined certain of the development milestones and all of the regulatory milestones under the baxter agreement are substantive 
revenues from development and regulatory milestones  if they are non refundable and deemed substantive  are recognized upon successful accomplishment of the milestones as research and development revenue 
milestones that are not considered substantive are accounted for as license payments and are evaluated as such in accordance with asu no 
sales based and commercial milestones are accounted for as royalties and are recorded as revenue upon achievement of the milestone  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
fair value measurements financial assets that we measure at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents and marketable securities 
these financial assets are generally classified as level or within the fair value hierarchy 
in general  fair values determined by level inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize data 
table of contents points that are observable  such as quoted prices adjusted  interest rates and yield curves 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize unobservable data points for the asset or liability  and include situations where there is little  if any  market activity for the asset or liability 
the fair value hierarchy level is determined by the lowest level of significant input 
our financial assets have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued at the end of each reporting period  typically utilizing third party pricing services or other market observable data 
the pricing services utilize industry standard valuation models  including both income and market based approaches  and observable market inputs to determine value 
these observable market inputs include reportable trades  benchmark yields  credit spreads  broker dealer quotes  bids  offers  current spot rates and other industry and economic events 
we validate the prices provided by its third party pricing services by reviewing their pricing methods and matrices  obtaining market values from other pricing sources  analyzing pricing data in certain instances and confirming that the relevant markets are active 
we did not adjust or override any fair value measurements provided by its pricing services as of december  and december  during the years ended december  and  there were no transfers between level and level financial assets 
we did not have any non recurring fair value measurements on any assets or liabilities at december  and december  the carrying amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets for cash  accounts receivable  unbilled revenue  other current assets  accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to their short term maturities 
marketable securities we invest our excess cash balances in short term and long term marketable debt securities 
we have established guidelines relating to diversification and maturities that allow us to manage risk 
we classify our investments in marketable debt securities as available for sale based on facts and circumstances present at the time we purchase the securities 
we report available for sale investments at fair value at each balance sheet date and include any unrealized holding gains and losses the adjustment to fair value in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method and are included in interest income 
to determine whether an other than temporary impairment exists  we consider whether we intend to sell the debt security and  if we do not intend to sell the debt security  we consider available evidence to assess whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis 
we have reviewed our investments with unrealized losses and have concluded that no other than temporary impairment existed at december  as we have the ability and intent to hold these investments to maturity and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis 
we did not record any impairment charges related to our marketable debt securities during the years ended december   and additionally  there were no realized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities during the years ended december   or intangible assets we have acquired intangible assets that we value and record 
we use a discounted cash flow model to value intangible assets at acquisition 
the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash inflows and outflows  risk and the cost of capital 
each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset 
we review intangible assets for impairment on a periodic basis using an undiscounted net cash flows approach when impairment indicators arise 
if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset  we would write down the intangible asset to the discounted cash flow value 
where 
table of contents we cannot identify cash flows for an individual asset  our review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable 
share based compensation expense we recognize the fair value of share based compensation in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss income 
share based compensation expense primarily relates to stock options  restricted stock and stock issued under our stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan 
we recognize share based compensation expense equal to the fair value of stock options on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
restricted stock awards are recorded as compensation cost  based on the market value on the date of the grant  on a straight line basis over each award explicit or implicit service periods 
we estimate an award implicit service period based on our best estimate of the period over which an award vesting condition s will be achieved 
we review and evaluate these estimates on a quarterly basis and will recognize any remaining unrecognized compensation as of the date of an estimate revision over the revised remaining implicit service period 
we issue new shares upon stock option exercises  upon the grant of restricted stock awards and under our employee stock purchase plan 
we estimate the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
the black scholes merton option pricing model requires us to develop certain subjective assumptions including the expected volatility of our stock  the expected term of the award and the expected forfeiture rate associated with our stock option plan 
we consider  among other factors  the implied volatilities of our currently traded options to provide an estimate of volatility based upon current trading activity 
we use a blended volatility rate based upon our historical performance  as well as the implied volatilities of our currently traded options  as we believe this appropriately reflects the expected volatility of our stock 
changes in market price directly affect volatility and could cause share based compensation expense to vary significantly in future reporting periods 
the expected term of awards represents the period of time that the awards are expected to be outstanding 
we use a blend of our own historical data and peer data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior  adjusted for known trends  to arrive at the estimated expected life of an option 
for purposes of identifying peer entities  we consider characteristics such as industry  stage of life cycle and financial leverage 
we review and evaluate these assumptions regularly to reflect recent historical data 
the risk free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the united states treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we apply an estimated forfeiture rate to current period expense to recognize share based compensation expense only for those stock and option awards expected to vest 
we estimate forfeitures based upon historical data  adjusted for known trends  and will adjust our estimate of forfeitures if actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ from such estimates 
subsequent changes in estimated forfeitures will be recognized through a cumulative adjustment in the period of change and will also impact the amount of share based compensation expense in future periods 
income taxes we determine our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be recovered 

table of contents we apply judgment in the determination of the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we recognize any material interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
we file income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction and multiple state jurisdictions 
we are no longer subject to any tax assessment from an income tax examination for years before  except to the extent that in the future we utilize net operating losses or tax credit carryforwards that originated before as of december   we were not under examination by the internal revenue service or other jurisdictions for any tax years 
related party transactions in april  we entered into an asset purchase agreement  or the purchase agreement  with parivid  llc  or parivid  a provider of data integration and analysis services to us  and s 
raguram  the principal owner and chief technology officer of parivid 
parivid was considered to be a related party as a co founder and then member of our board of directors is the brother of s 
raguram 
pursuant to the purchase agreement  we acquired patent rights  software  know how and other intangible assets  and assumed certain specified liabilities of parivid related to the acquired assets in exchange for million in cash paid at closing and up to million in contingent milestone payments in a combination of cash and or stock in the manner and on the terms and conditions set forth in the purchase agreement 
the contingent milestone payments are structured to include i potential payments of no more than million in cash if certain milestones are achieved within two years from the date of the purchase agreement  or the initial milestones  and ii the issuance of up to million of our common stock to parivid if certain other milestones are achieved within fifteen years of the date of the purchase agreement 
in  we recorded a total purchase price of million that includes the million cash paid at the closing and million in initial milestone payments  which were probable and accrued at the time 
in august  we entered into an amendment to the purchase agreement where we agreed to extend the time period for completion of the initial milestones to june   specified those initial milestones that had been achieved as of june  and  as consideration for the completion and satisfaction of the initial milestones that were achieved  agreed to pay parivid million cash and to issue  shares of our common stock  at a value of per share 
in addition  in september  we made a cash payment of million to parivid  recorded as other expense  representing the difference between the net proceeds from parivid sale of the shares issued in satisfaction of the initial milestones and the value of such shares as of the date of the amendment 
in july  we entered into an amendment to the purchase agreement where the parties agreed that a milestone payment would be made in cash rather than through the issuance of our common stock 
in august  we paid parivid million in cash  in lieu of stock  pursuant to this amendment as consideration for the completion and satisfaction of a milestone related to the enoxaparin sodium injection developed technology that was achieved in july we capitalized the payment as developed technology  which is included in intangible assets in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and the developed technology is being amortized over the estimated useful life of the enoxaparin sodium injection developed technology of approximately years

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
our current investment policy is to maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of united states money market  government secured  and high grade corporate securities  directly or through managed funds  with maturities of twenty four months or less 
our cash is deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in north america 
our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
however  due to the conservative nature of our investments  low prevailing market rates and relatively short effective maturities of debt instruments  interest rate risk is mitigated 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   we estimate that the fair value of our investment portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
we do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative  foreign currency or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item
