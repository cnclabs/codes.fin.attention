item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
executive summary the company is a fully integrated real estate investment trust which focuses primarily on ownership and operation of grocery anchored shopping centers straddling the washington dc to boston corridor 
at december   the company owned and managed a portfolio of operating properties excluding properties held for sale conveyance totaling approximately million square feet of gross leasable area gla 
the portfolio was occupied at december  in keeping with its stated goal of reducing overall leverage to an appropriate level by selling non core assets  the company determined in to completely exit the ohio market  principally the discount drug mart portfolio of drugstore convenience centers  and concentrate on the region that straddles the washington dc to boston corridor  to concentrate on grocery anchored strip centers  by disposing of its mall and single tenant triple net lease properties  to focus on improving operations and performance at the company s remaining properties  and to reduce development activities  by disposing of certain development projects  land acquired for development  and other non core assets 
on october   the company concluded definitive agreements with riocan to exit the cedar riocan joint venture that owned retail properties 
on october   the company concluded definitive agreements with hii relating to the application of the buy sell provisions of the joint venture agreements for each of the nine properties owned by the joint venture 
see significant transactions below for additional information relating to these transactions 
the company  organized as a maryland corporation  has established an umbrella partnership structure through the contribution of substantially all of its assets to cedar realty trust partnership lp the operating partnership  organized as a limited partnership under the laws of delaware 
the company conducts substantially all of its business through the operating partnership 
at december   the company owned of the operating partnership and is its sole general partner 
the approximately  limited operating partnership units op units are economically equivalent to the company s common stock and are convertible into the company s common stock at the option of the holders on a one to one basis 
the company derives substantially all of its revenues from rents and operating expense reimbursements received pursuant to long term leases 
the company s operating results therefore depend on the ability of its tenants to make the payments required by the terms of their leases 
the company focuses its investment activities on grocery anchored community shopping centers 
the company believes that  because of the need of consumers to purchase food and other staple goods and services generally available at such centers  its type of necessities based properties should provide relatively stable revenue flows even during difficult economic times 

table of contents significant transactions as discussed above  the company developed a disposition plan with the stated goal of reducing overall leverage to an appropriate level by selling non core assets 
the carrying values of the assets and liabilities of these properties  principally the net book values of the real estate and the related mortgage loans payable to be assumed by the buyers or conveyed to the mortgagee  have been reclassified as held for sale conveyance on the company s consolidated balance sheets at december  and december  in addition  the properties results of operations have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented

table of contents summary of critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition and the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  real estate investments and purchase accounting allocations related thereto  asset impairment  and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risks 
management s estimates are based both on information that is currently available and on various other assumptions management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates and those estimates could be different under varying assumptions or conditions 
the company has identified the following critical accounting policies  the application of which requires significant judgments and estimates revenue recognition rental income with scheduled rent increases is recognized using the straight line method over the respective terms of the leases 
the aggregate excess of rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis over base rents under applicable lease provisions is included in straight line rents receivable on the consolidated balance sheet 
leases also generally contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse the company for a portion of property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred  such income is recognized in the periods earned 
in addition  certain operating leases contain contingent rent provisions under which tenants are required to pay a percentage of their sales in excess of a specified amount as additional rent 
the company defers recognition of contingent rental income until those specified targets are met 
the company must make estimates as to the collectability of its accounts receivable related to base rent  straight line rent  expense reimbursements and other revenues 
management analyzes accounts receivable by considering tenant creditworthiness  current economic conditions  and changes in tenants payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
these estimates have a direct impact on net income  because a higher bad debt allowance would result in lower net income  whereas a lower bad debt allowance would result in higher net income 
real estate investments real estate investments are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation 
the provision for depreciation is calculated using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives 
expenditures for maintenance  repairs and betterments that do not materially prolong the normal useful life of an asset are charged to operations as incurred 
expenditures for betterments that substantially extend the useful lives of real estate assets are capitalized 
real estate investments include costs of development and redevelopment activities  and construction in progress 
capitalized costs  including interest and other carrying costs during the construction and or renovation periods  are included in the cost of the related asset and charged to operations through depreciation over the asset s estimated useful life 
the company is required to make subjective estimates as to the useful lives of its real estate assets for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis 
these assessments have a 
table of contents direct impact on net income 
a shorter estimate of the useful life of an asset would have the effect of increasing depreciation expense and lowering net income  whereas a longer estimate of the useful life of an asset would have the effect of reducing depreciation expense and increasing net income 
a variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition  development and leasing of a property  such as pre construction costs essential to the development of the property  development costs  construction costs  interest costs  real estate taxes  salaries and related costs  and other costs incurred during the period of development 
after a determination is made to capitalize a cost  it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited 
the company ceases capitalization on the portions substantially completed and occupied  or held available for occupancy  and capitalizes only those costs associated with the portions under construction 
the company considers a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements  but not later than one year from cessation of major development activity 
determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment 
the effect of a longer capitalization period would be to increase capitalized costs and would result in higher net income  whereas the effect of a shorter capitalization period would be to reduce capitalized costs and would result in lower net income 
the company allocates the fair value of real estate acquired to land  buildings and improvements 
in addition  the fair value of in place leases is allocated to intangible lease assets and liabilities 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  which value is then allocated to land  buildings and improvements based on management s determination of the relative fair values of such assets 
in valuing an acquired property s intangibles  factors considered by management include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods  such as real estate taxes  insurance  other operating expenses  and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease up periods based on its evaluation of current market demand 
management also estimates costs to execute similar leases  including leasing commissions  tenant improvements  legal and other related costs 
the values of acquired above market and below market leases are recorded based on the present values using discount rates which reflect the risks associated with the leases acquired of the differences between the contractual amounts to be received and management s estimate of market lease rates  measured over the terms of the respective leases that management deemed appropriate at the time of the acquisitions 
such valuations include a consideration of the non cancellable terms of the respective leases as well as any applicable renewal period s 
the fair values associated with below market rental renewal options are determined based on the company s experience and the relevant facts and circumstances that existed at the time of the acquisitions 
the values of above market leases are amortized to rental income over the terms of the respective non cancelable lease periods 
the portion of the values of below market leases associated with the original non cancelable lease terms are amortized to rental income over the terms of the respective non cancelable lease periods 
the portion of the values of the leases associated with below market renewal options that are likely of exercise are amortized to rental income over the respective renewal periods 
the value of other intangible assets including leasing commissions  tenant improvements  etc 
is amortized to expense over the applicable terms of the respective leases 
if a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration or not renewed  all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be recognized in operations at that time 

table of contents management is required to make subjective assessments in connection with its valuation of real estate acquisitions 
these assessments have a direct impact on net income  because above market and below market lease intangibles are amortized to rental income  and the value of other intangibles is amortized to expense 
accordingly  higher allocations to below market lease liability and other intangibles would result in higher rental income and amortization expense  whereas lower allocations to below market lease liability and other intangibles would result in lower rental income and amortization expense 
management reviews each real estate investment for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a real estate investment may not be recoverable 
the review of recoverability is based on an estimate of the future cash flows that are expected to result from the real estate investment s use and eventual disposition 
these estimates of cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if an impairment event exists due to the projected inability to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value 
a real estate investment held for sale is carried at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value  less the cost of a potential sale 
depreciation and amortization are suspended during the period the property is held for sale 
management is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate properties 
these assessments have a direct impact on net income  because an impairment loss is recognized in the period that the assessment is made

same property net operating income same property net operating income same property noi is a widely used non gaap financial measure for reits that the company believes  when considered with financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap  is useful to investors as it provides an indication of the recurring cash generated by the company s properties by excluding certain non cash revenues and expenses  as well as other infrequent items such as lease termination income which tends to fluctuate more than rents from year to year 
properties are included in same property noi if they are owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared  except for properties undergoing significant redevelopment and expansion until such properties have stabilized  and properties classified as held for sale conveyance 
consistent with the capital treatment of such costs under gaap  tenant improvements  leasing commissions and other direct leasing costs are excluded from same property noi 
same property noi should not be considered as an alternative to net income prepared in accordance with gaap or as a measure of liquidity 
further  same property noi is a measure for which there is no standard industry definition and  as such  it is not consistently defined or reported on among the company s peers  and thus may not provide an adequate basis for comparison between reits 
the following table reconciles same property noi to the company s consolidated operating income

funds from operations funds from operations ffo is a widely recognized non gaap financial measure for reits that the company believes  when considered with financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap  is useful to investors in understanding financial performance and providing a relevant basis for comparison among reits 
in addition  ffo is useful to investors as it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciable assets 
investors should review ffo  along with gaap net income  when trying to understand a reit s operating performance 
the company considers ffo an important supplemental measure of its operating performance and believes that it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits 

table of contents the company computes ffo in accordance with the white paper published by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  which defines ffo as net income applicable to common shareholders determined in accordance with gaap  excluding impairment charges  gains or losses from debt restructurings and sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for partnerships and joint ventures which are computed to reflect ffo on the same basis 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to net income applicable to common shareholders or to cash flow from operating activities 
ffo is not indicative of cash available to fund ongoing cash needs  including the ability to make cash distributions 
although ffo is a measure used for comparability in assessing the performance of reits  as the nareit white paper only provides guidelines for computing ffo  the computation of ffo may vary from one company to another 
the following table sets forth the company s calculations of ffo for  and net income loss attributable to common shareholders add deduct real estate depreciation and amortization limited partners interest impairment charges  net gain loss on exit from unconsolidated joint ventures gain on sales consolidated minority interests share of income share of ffo unconsolidated joint ventures share of income share of ffo ffo inflation inflation has been relatively low in recent years and has not had a significant detrimental impact on the company s results of operations 
should inflation rates increase in the future  substantially all of the company s tenant leases contain provisions designed to partially mitigate the negative impact of inflation in the near term 
such lease provisions include clauses that require tenants to reimburse the company for real estate taxes and many of the operating expenses it incurs 
significant inflation rate increases over a prolonged period of time may have a material adverse impact on the company s business
