risk factors 
introduction the following discussion summarizes our results of operations for each of the fiscal years ended july   and fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively and our financial condition as at july  and  with a particular emphasis on fiscal  our most recently completed fiscal year 
business we operate in a single reportable segment and since  as more fully described under general business of item business  we have been engaged in uranium mining and related activities  including exploration  pre extraction  extraction and processing  on uranium projects located in the united states and paraguay 
we utilize in situ recovery isr mining where possible which we believe  when compared to conventional open pit or underground mining  requires lower capital and operating expenditures with a shorter lead time to extraction and a reduced impact on the environment 
we have one uranium mine located in the state of texas  the palangana mine  which utilizes isr mining and commenced extraction of triuranium octoxide uo  or yellowcake  in november we have one uranium processing facility or mill located in the state of texas  the hobson processing facility  which processes material from the palangana mine into drums of uo  our only sales product and source of revenue  for shipping to a third party storage and sales facility 
at july   we have one offtake agreement with a remaining delivery commitment of  pounds of uo the hobson processing facility has a physical capacity to process two million pounds of uo annually and is licensed to process up to one million pounds of uo annually  which provides for the capacity to process material from a number of isr mines 
we utilize a hub and spoke strategy in south texas whereby the hobson processing facility acts as our central uranium processing site the hub for the palangana mine and for future satellite isr mines  such as our goliad project  the spokes located within the south texas uranium belt 
we also hold certain mineral exploration interests in various stages in the states of arizona  colorado  new mexico  texas and wyoming and in paraguay  many of which are located in historically successful mining areas and have been the subject of past exploration activities by other mining companies 
we do not expect  however  to utilize isr mining for all of these mineral exploration interests in which case we would expect to rely on conventional open pit and or underground mining techniques 
our operating and strategic framework is based on expanding our uranium extraction activities  which includes advancing certain uranium projects with established mineralized materials towards uranium extraction  and establishing additional mineralized materials on our existing uranium projects or through acquisition of additional uranium projects 
during fiscal we continued uranium extraction at production areas and of the palangana mine and in december  commenced uranium extraction at production area  while permitting  exploration and pre extraction activities continued at production areas  and  we processed a total of  pounds of u 

o 

at the hobson processing facility  we completed four sales of uranium concentrates totaling  pounds generating revenues of million  we received final uranium extraction authorization for the goliad project from the texas commission on environmental quality  including an aquifer exemption for which the required concurrence from the environmental protection agency was received  we completed a drill program with exploration holes totaling  feet of drilling for the burke hollow project located in texas  we completed a drill program with exploration holes totaling  feet of drilling for the channen project located in texas  and we closed a million senior secured loan facility whereby we received an initial funding of million at an interest rate of per annum for a two year term 
additional funding of million is available for draw down by us on or before january   subject to certain conditions  and a further additional funding of million is available for draw down by us on or before july   subject to certain conditions  all at a standby fee of per annum 
the proceeds of the credit facility are limited by contract for use on the development  operation and maintenance of the hobson processing facility  the goliad project and the palangana mine and for working capital purposes 
since commencing uranium extraction at the palangana mine in november to july   the hobson processing facility has processed finished goods representing  pounds fiscal  fiscal  fiscal  of uo extracted solely from the palangana mine  of which  pounds of uo fiscal  fiscal  fiscal nil were sold generating cumulative revenue of million fiscal million  fiscal million  fiscal nil 
this revenue was generated solely from the sale of uo extracted from the palangana mine  and directly the result of commencing uranium extraction and neither incidental to nor the result of minerals encountered in the course of exploration or pre extraction activities 
subsequent to fiscal  we announced on september  by press release our plan to align our operations to adapt to the existing uranium market in a challenging post fukushima environment  most notably the uranium spot price being at a seven year low 
as a result  uranium extraction at paa  and of the palangana mine will operate at a reduced pace  including the deferral of any further pre extraction expenditures  to maintain operational readiness to ramp up output in anticipation of a recovery in uranium spot prices 
pre extraction activities at other paas of the palangana mine and at the goliad project are expected to continue as planned  as well as further exploration and permitting activities at the burke hollow project 
key issues since commencing uranium extraction at the palangana mine in november to july   we have been focused primarily on expanding our south texas uranium extraction and establishing additional uranium mines through exploration and pre extraction activities and direct acquisitions  all of which require us to manage numerous challenges  risks and uncertainties inherent in our business and operations as more fully described in item a 
risk factors 
our operations are capital intensive  and we will require significant additional financing to acquire additional uranium projects and continue with our exploration and pre extraction activities 
historically  we have been reliant primarily on equity financings from the sale of our common stock and  most recently  on debt financing to fund our operations 
we have also relied on cash flows generated from our mining activities during fiscal and  however  we have yet to achieve profitability or develop positive cash flow from operations 
our reliance on equity and debt financings is expected to continue for the foreseeable future  and their availability whenever such additional financing is required  will be dependent on many factors beyond our control such as the volatility in the global financial markets affecting our stock price  the status of the worldwide economy and the market price of uranium 
there is no assurance that we will be successful in securing any form of additional financing when required and on terms favorable to us 
our inability to obtain additional financing would have a negative impact on our operations  including delays  curtailment or abandonment of any one or all of our uranium projects 
we have not established proven or probable reserves  as defined by the sec under industry guide  through the completion of a final or bankable feasibility study for any of our mineral projects 
we have established the existence of mineralized materials for certain uranium projects  including the palangana mine 
since we commenced uranium extraction at the palangana mine without having established proven or probable reserves  there may be greater inherent uncertainty as to whether or not any mineralized material can be economically extracted as originally planned and anticipated 
the palangana mine has been our sole source for the uo sold to generate our revenues during fiscal and  with no revenues generated prior to fiscal the economic viability of our mining activities  including the expected duration and profitability of the palangana mine and of any future satellite isr mines  such as the goliad project  located within the south texas uranium belt  has many risks and uncertainties 
these include  but are not limited to i a significant  pro longed decrease in the market price of uranium  ii difficulty in marketing and or selling uranium concentrates  iii significantly higher than expected capital costs to construct the mine and or processing plant  iv significantly higher than expected extraction costs  v significantly lower than expected uranium extraction  vi significant delays  reductions or stoppages of uranium extraction activities  and vii the introduction of significantly more stringent regulatory laws and regulations 
our mining activities may change as a result of any one or more of these risks and uncertainties and there is no assurance that any ore body that we extract mineralized materials from will result in profitable mining activities 
at july   we had one multi year uranium sales agreement based on the uranium spot price at the time of delivery  and since future sales of uo are expected to generally occur under this uranium supply agreement orthrough the uranium spot market  fluctuations in the spot price of uranium has had and will continue to have a direct impact on our revenues and cash flows 
the table below provides the high low average close for each of the last five fiscal years ended july as obtained from the ux consulting company  llc fiscal year ended july  high low average close historically  the spot price of uranium has been difficult to predict and subject to significant volatility  and will continue to be affected by numerous factors beyond our control 
exploration stage we have established the existence of mineralized materials for certain uranium projects  including the palangana mine 
we have not established proven or probable reserves  as defined by the sec under industry guide  through the completion of a final or bankable feasibility study for any of our uranium projects  including the palangana mine 
furthermore  we have no plans to establish proven or probable reserves for any of our uranium projects for which we plan on utilizing isr mining  such as the palangana mine 
as a result  and despite the fact that we commenced extraction of mineralized materials at the palangana mine in november  we remain in the exploration stage as defined under industry guide  and will continue to remain in the exploration stage until such time proven or probable reserves have been established 
since we commenced extraction of mineralized materials at the palangana mine without having established proven and probable reserves  any mineralized materials established or extracted from the palangana mine should not be in any way associated with having established or produced from proven or probable reserves 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap under which expenditures relating to the acquisition of mineral rights are initially capitalized as incurred while exploration and pre extraction expenditures are expensed as incurred until such time we exit the exploration stage by establishing proven or probable reserves 
expenditures relating to exploration activities such as drill programs to search for additional mineralized material are expensed as incurred 
expenditures relating to pre extraction activities such as the construction of mine wellfields  ion exchange facilities and disposal wells are expensed as incurred until such time proven or probable reserves are established for that uranium project  after which subsequent expenditures relating to mine development activities for that particular project are capitalized as incurred 
companies in the production stage as defined by the sec under industry guide  having established proven and probable reserves and exited the exploration stage  typically capitalize expenditures relating to ongoing development activities  with corresponding depletion calculated over proven and probable reserves using the units of production method and allocated to future reporting periods to inventory and  as that inventory is sold  to cost of goods sold 
as we are in the exploration stage  it has resulted in our reporting of larger losses than if we had been in the production stage due to the expensing  instead of capitalizing  of expenditures relating to ongoing mill and mine development activities 
additionally  there would be no corresponding amortization allocated to our future reporting periods since those costs would have been expensed previously  resulting in both lower inventory costs and cost of goods sold and results of operations with higher gross profits and lower losses than if we had been in the production stage 
any capitalized costs  such as expenditures relating to the acquisition of mineral rights  are depleted over the estimated extraction life using the straight line method 
as a result  our consolidated financial statements may not be directly comparable to the financial statements of companies in the production stage 
development stage entity prior to the quarter ended october  fiscal q  we met the definition of a development stage entity as defined under accounting standards codification section development stage entities asc and presented the additional financial statement disclosures required by a development stage entity under asc  including the presentation of cumulative amounts since inception for the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss  stockholders equity and cash flows 
in fiscal q  during which we generated significant revenue from our planned principal operations by completing our first sale of uo  we no longer met the definition of a development stage entity 
accordingly  and starting with the filing of our form q for fiscal q  we no longer presented the additional financial statement disclosures required by a development stage entity under asc results of operations for the fiscal  and for fiscal  and  we recorded a net loss of  per share   per share and  per share  respectively 
expenses during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were   and  respectively 
during fiscal and  we generated a gross profit of  and  respectively  from sales of uo fiscal nil 
during the last three fiscal years  we commenced uranium extraction at the palangana mine and processing of those materials at the hobson processing facility  completed a number of strategic corporate and project acquisitions and continued with exploration and pre extraction activities on our various uranium projects 
during fiscal  we continued with uranium extraction and added the paa wellfield at the palangana mine  and processing of those materials at the hobson processing facility 
in texas  we added the welder project to our south texas project portfolio 
during fiscal  we continued with uranium extraction and added the paa wellfield at the palangana mine  and processing of those materials at the hobson processing facility 
in paraguay  we acquired the yuty project  our second major project in that country  through the acquisition of cue resources ltd  a former publicly traded company  and also acquired an additional two prospecting permits at the coronel oviedo project 
in texas  we added the burke hollow and channen projects to our south texas project portfolio 
in arizona  we acquired the anderson project through a merger with concentric energy corp  a private company  and also the workman creek project 
in colorado  we acquired the slick rock project 
during fiscal  we commenced uranium extraction at the palangana mine beginning with paa and processing of those materials at the hobson processing facility 
in paraguay  we acquired two prospecting permits at the coronel oviedo project 
revenues and cost of sales since commencing uranium extraction at the palangana mine in november  we completed a total of seven sales representing  pounds of uo to july   all of which occurred during fiscal and during fiscal  sales of uo generated gross revenues of  fiscal 
during fiscal  a total of  pounds fiscal  pounds of uo were sold at an average price of per pound fiscal  of which  pounds fiscal  pounds were sold under delivery commitments pursuant to an existing offtake agreement  with the remaining  pounds fiscal  pounds sold on the spot market 
at july   a delivery commitment of  pounds remains outstanding pursuant to this offtake agreement for completion no later than july  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  the average spot price per pound decreased to compared to  as a result of the decrease in the market price of uo during fiscal  cost of sales of uo were  fiscal  which included royalties of  fiscal  depreciation and depletion of  fiscal  and write down of inventory of  fiscal nil 
this write down adjusts the uo inventory balance in finished goods and work in progress at july  to net realizable value to reflect the market price of uo of per pound on that date  less estimated royalties  a significant decrease compared to per pound at july  cost of sales of uo is determined using the average cost per pound in inventories at the end of the month prior to the month in which the sale occurs  and includes royalties and other direct selling costs 
during fiscal  cost of sales excluding royalties  depreciation and depletion and write down of inventory were  or per pound which increased compared to  or per pound during fiscal this increase in cost of sales during fiscal represents an increase in extraction costs overall due primarily to our additional efforts to increase extraction rates  such as the use of more effective chemicals in the injection process and reworking existing well and surface facilities to increase flow rates  combined with lower extraction volume results overall 
as a result of the above  the company generated a gross profit of  or  excluding the write down of inventory  during fiscal fiscal  fiscal nil from sales of uo expenses during fiscal  expenses totaled  fiscal  fiscal  comprised of mineral property expenditures of  fiscal  fiscal  general and administrative of  fiscal  fiscal  depreciation  amortization and accretion of  fiscal  fiscal  and impairment loss on mineral properties of nil fiscal nil  fiscal

the following summary provides a discussion of the major expense categories  including analyses of the factors that caused any significant variances from year to year for fiscal  salaries  management and consulting fees totaled  fiscal  fiscal  which have remained relatively consistent with no significant changes on a year to year basis  during fiscal  office  investor relations  communications and travel expenses totaled  which decreased significantly by  compared to  during fiscal after a significant expansion during fiscal  we focused our efforts on monitoring and controlling these costs to reduce expenses where possible during fiscal we expect to realize further decreases during fiscal  during fiscal  office  investor relations  communications and travel expenses totaled  which increased significantly by  compared to  during fiscal  due primarily to a significant increase in the number of strategic corporate and project acquisitions completed in paraguay  texas  arizona and colorado 
we increased our general and administrative support overall to accommodate the expansion of our existing operations by the addition of these new projects  including expansion of our new mexico office 
we also incurred additional due diligence costs relating to these acquisitions and potential acquisitions that were reviewed 
during fiscal  we established our paraguayan office for general and administrative support to accommodate the addition of our first project in paraguay  during fiscal  professional fees including legal and audit fees totaled  which decreased by  compared to  during fiscal during fiscal  professional fees totaled  which increased by  compared to  during fiscal this increase was primarily the result of the number of strategic corporate and project acquisitions completed in paraguay  texas  arizona and colorado and potential acquisitions that were reviewed  and during fiscal  stock based compensation expense totaled  which decreased significantly by  compared to  during fiscal during fiscal  stock based compensation expense totaled  which decreased significantly by  compared to  during fiscal these decreases were primarily the result of a significant decrease in the number of stock options granted during fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal stock based compensation represents the fair value of stock options granted to employees  directors  management and consultants  including the fair value of common stock issued to consultants 
depreciation  amortization and accretion for fiscal  depreciation  amortization and accretion totaled  fiscal  fiscal  which have increased overall on a year to year basis consistent with the continued expansion in our operations 
depreciation  amortization and accretion include depreciation and amortization of long term assets acquired in the normal course of operations and accretion of asset retirement obligations 
impairment loss on mineral properties for fiscal  impairment loss on mineral properties totaled  as a result of the abandonment of certain mineral properties located in utah and texas 
during fiscal and fiscal  no impairment loss was recorded as a result of the abandonment of mineral properties 
uranium extraction and inventories during fiscal  we extracted  pounds fiscal  pounds of uo from the palangana mine while the hobson facility processed finished goods representing  pounds fiscal  pounds of uo since commencing uranium extraction at the palangana mine in november to july   the hobson facility has processed finished goods representing  pounds of uo  of which  pounds have been sold  resulting in a finished goods inventory balance of  pounds of uo remaining as of july  at july   the total value of inventories was  of which  represents the value of finished goods of uo   represents the value of work in progress and  represents the value of supplies 
the cash component of the total value of inventories was  and the non cash component of the total value of inventory was  at july   a write down of inventory of  was recorded to adjust the uo inventory balance in finished goods and work in progress to net realizable value to reflect the market price of uo of per pound at july   less estimated royalties  a significant decrease compared to market price of per pound at july  at july   the total value of inventories was  of which  represents the value of finished goods of uo   represents the value of work in progress and  represents the value of supplies 
the cash component of the total value of inventories was  and the non cash component of the total value of inventory was  cash and non cash components of the total value of inventories represent non gaap financial measures which we believe are important in evaluating our operating results not only for management but for our investors 
we use these measures to compare our performance with other mining companies and rely upon them as part of management s decision making process 
liquidity and capital resources july  july  cash and cash equivalents   current assets   current liabilities   working capital   at july   we had working capital of  a decrease of  from working capital of  at july  at july   we had  july   in cash and cash equivalents  which represented the largest component of our working capital balance 
as a result  our working capital balance will fluctuate significantly as we utilize our cash and cash equivalents to fund our operations including exploration and pre extraction activities 
although our planned principal operations have commenced from which we realized significant gross revenues from sales of uo during fiscal of  and fiscal of  we have yet to achieve profitability and have had a history of operating losses and significant negative cash flow since inception 
for fiscal  our net losses totaled  fiscal  fiscal  and we had an accumulated deficit balance of  as at july  during fiscal  net cash flows decreased by  compared to a decrease of  during fiscal and an increase of  during fiscal we do not expect to achieve profitability or develop positive cash flow from operations in the near term 
effective july   we closed a million senior secured loan facility whereby we received an initial funding of million at an interest rate of per annum for a two year term 
additional funding of million is available for draw down by us on or before january   subject to certain conditions  and a further additional funding of million is available for draw down by us on or before july   subject to certain conditions  all at a standby fee of per annum 
the proceeds of the credit facility are limited by contract for use on the development  operation and maintenance of the hobson processing facility  the goliad project and the palangana mine and for working capital purposes 
historically  we have been reliant primarily on equity financings from the sale of our common stock and  most recently  on debt financing to fund our operations 
we have also relied on cash flows generated from our mining activities during fiscal and our reliance on equity and debt financings is expected to continue for the foreseeable future  and their availability whenever such additional financing is required  will be dependent on many factors  including but not limited to those factors beyond our control such as volatility in the global financial markets affecting our stock price  the status of the worldwide economy and the market price of uranium  any one of which may cause significant challenges in our ability to access additional financing  including access to the equity and credit markets 
we also filed a form s shelf registration statement that became effective september  which provides for the offer and sale of certain securities of the company from time to time  at our discretion  up to an aggregate public offering of million of which approximately million was sold in our public offering which closed on april  we may also be required to seek other forms of financing  such as joint venture arrangements to continue advancing our uranium projects which would depend entirely on finding a suitable third party willing to enter into such an arrangement  typically involving an assignment of a percentage interest in the mineral project 
however  there is no assurance that we will be successful in securing any form of additional financing when required and on terms favorable to us 
our operations are capital intensive  and we will require significant additional financing to acquire additional uranium projects and continue with our exploration and pre extraction activities 
in the absence of such additional financing  we would not be able to fund our operations  including continuing with our exploration and pre extraction activities  which may result in delay  curtailment or abandonment of any one or all of our uranium projects 
on september   we announced by press release our plan to align our operations to adapt to the existing uranium market in a challenging post fukushima environment  most notably the uranium spot price being at a seven year low 
as a result  uranium extraction at paa  and of the palangana mine will operate at a reduced pace  including the deferral of any further pre extraction expenditures  to maintain operational readiness to ramp up output in anticipation of a recovery in uranium spot prices 
pre extraction activities at other paas of the palangana mine and at the goliad project are expected to continue as planned  as well as further exploration and permitting activities at the burke hollow project 
as a result  we do not expect to rely on cash flows generated from our mining activities for fiscal to the extent relied upon during fiscal and existing cash resources and available sources of financing are expected to provide sufficient funds to meet our obligations and carry out our plan of operations for the fiscal year ended july  fiscal 
for fiscal  we estimate that a total of up to million will be incurred for exploration and pre extraction activities  such as permitting  drilling and mine construction including related labor and equipment purchases  for our uranium projects located in texas 
also  we hold mineral rights in the states of arizona  colorado  new mexico  texas and wyoming and in paraguay with annual land related payments totaling million to maintain these rights in good standing 
our anticipated exploration and pre extraction activities  however  will be dependent on and may change as a result of our financial position  the market price of uranium and other considerations  and such change may include accelerating the pace of reducing our operations as originally announced on september   as well as broadening the scope of these reductions 
our ability to secure funding for these activities will be impacted by our operating performance  other uses of cash  the market price of uranium  the market price of our common stock  our ability to secure adequate financing and other factors which may be beyond our control 
specific examples of such factors include  but are not limited to if the weakness in the market price of uranium experienced in fiscal continues or weakens further during fiscal  it may have a negative effect on our decision to continue with our exploration and pre extraction activities  if we are unable to or decide not to draw down further on the  senior secured credit facility  under which we received initial funding of  with an additional us  available for draw down on or before january  and a further additional  available for draw down on or before july   it would adversely affect our financial position  and our ability to continue with our exploration and pre extraction activities  and if the weakness in the market price of our common stock experienced in fiscal continues or weakens further for fiscal  it would affect our ability to secure adequate financing to continue with our exploration and pre extraction activities 
our continuation as a going concern for a period beyond fiscal will be dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate additional financing  as future capital expenditures are expected to be substantial 
our long term success  including the recoverability of the carrying values of our assets and our ability to acquire additional uranium projects and continue with exploration and pre extraction activities and mining activities on our existing uranium projects  will depend ultimately on our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and to develop positive cash flow from our operations by establishing ore bodies that contain commercially recoverable uranium and to develop these into profitable mining activities 
the economic viability of our mining activities  including the expected duration and profitability of the palangana mine and of any future satellite isr mines  such as the goliad project  located within the south texas uranium belt  has many risks and uncertainties 
these include  but are not limited to i a significant  pro longed decrease in the market price of uranium  ii difficulty in marketing and or selling uranium concentrates  iii significantly higher than expected capital costs to construct the mine and or processing plant  iv significantly higher than expected extraction costs  v significantly lower than expected uranium extraction  vi significant delays  reductions or stoppages of uranium extraction activities  and vii the introduction of significantly more stringent regulatory laws and regulations 
our mining activities may change as a result of any one or more of these risks and uncertainties and there is no assurance that any ore body that we extract mineralized materials from will result in profitable mining activities
