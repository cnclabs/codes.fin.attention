our eco real time pcr system provides researchers with an affordable  full featured system to perform targeted validation studies 
our financial results have been  and will continue to be  impacted by several significant trends  which are described below 
while these trends are important to understanding and evaluating our financial results  this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in item  part i of this report  and the other transactions  events  and trends discussed in risk factors in item a  part i of this report 
funding environment there remains significant uncertainty concerning government and academic research funding worldwide as governments in the united states and europe  in particular  focus on reducing fiscal deficits while at the same time confronting slow economic growth 
we believe this uncertainty will continue in  which could lead to purchasing delays and could negatively impact our business 
while many of our customers receive funding from government agencies to purchase our products or services  we are increasingly less dependent on government funding 
in fiscal  approximately of our total revenue came from commercial customers who are not reliant on government agencies for funding  and it is our strategy to diversify our customer base to increase further the portion of our revenue from commercial customers over time 
however  we estimate that approximately one third of our total revenue continues to be derived  directly or indirectly  from funding provided by the us national institute of health nih 
in fiscal  the nih budget increased as compared to fiscal levels 
nih funding for the first quarter of will be subject to the continuing resolution that was signed into law by president obama and funds the nih at of budget 
the significance and timing of any reductions to the nih budget from march may be significantly impacted by the sequestration provisions of the budget control act of and by whether these provisions remain in effect 
in addition  the us department of health and human services hhs  of which the nih is a part  has the ability to reallocate funds within its budget to spare the nih from the full effect of hhs budget reductions 
we further believe that allocations within the nih budget will continue to favor genetic analysis tools generally and  in particular  research programs that utilize next generation sequencing 
next generation sequencing next generation sequencing has become a core technology for modern life science research and is increasingly being used in the applied  molecular diagnostics  and translational markets 
over the next several years  expansion of the sequencing market  including an increase in the number of samples available and enhancements in our product portfolio will continue to drive demand for our next generation sequencing technologies 
our sequencing instrument installed base continued to expand in as a result  we believe that our sequencing consumable revenue will continue to grow in future periods 
our sequencing instrument portfolio primarily includes the hiseq product family and miseq 
we began full commercial shipments in the fourth quarter of of our previously announced hiseq sequencing system  which allows customers to sequence an entire human genome in approximately a day 
our miseq sequencing system is a low cost personal sequencing system that we believe will provide individual researchers a platform with rapid turnaround time  high accuracy  and streamlined workflow 
we believe our miseq systems will continue to be a competitive offering in the lower throughput sequencing market and help us expand our presence in this emerging market segment 
microarrays as a complement to next generation sequencing  we believe microarrays offer a less expensive  faster  and highly accurate technology for use when genetic content is already known 
the information content of microarrays is fixed and reproducible 
as such  microarrays provide repeatable  standardized assays for certain subsets of nucleotide bases within the overall genome 
as the cost of sequencing continues to decrease  we believe that life science researchers will migrate certain whole genome array studies to sequencing over the next few years  however  we expect this decline to be offset by demand from customers in applied and translational markets 

table of contents financial overview financial highlights for include the following net revenue increased by during compared to the increase in revenue was primarily driven by an increase in consumable sales and instrument service contract revenue as our installed base continued to expand in we believe our revenue will continue to grow in gross profit as a percentage of revenue gross margin was in  an increase from in gross margin improved in due in large part to the shift in sales mix from instruments to consumables  which have a higher gross margin than instruments 
we believe our gross margin in future periods will depend on several factors  including market conditions that may impact our pricing power  product mix changes between consumable  instrument  and service sales  product mix changes between established products and new products in new markets  our cost structure for manufacturing operations  and our ability to create innovative and high premium products that meet or stimulate customer demand 
income from operations increased slightly by million in compared to this was a result of higher gross profit  which was driven by increased revenue  being mostly offset by higher operating expenses 
in  our research and development expenses increased by million and our selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million as we continue to grow our business 
we anticipate that the dollar amount of these expenses will increase as we continue to invest in our technology  people  and infrastructure to support our growth 
in  we completed the relocation of our headquarters that started in and incurred million in headquarter relocation expense  which primarily included a cease use loss upon vacating our prior headquarters  double rent expense during the transition to the new facility  and the accretion of interest expense on the related lease exit liability 
we do not expect to incur significant additional headquarter relocation expense other than the accretion of interest expense on lease exit liability 
in  we also incurred million in expenses associated with the unsolicited tender offer for shares of our common stock commenced by ckh acquisition corp 
and roche holding ltd 
together  roche in early we anticipate incurring additional advisory expenses through mid our effective tax rate was in  as compared to in the provision for income taxes is dependent on the mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates and the other factors discussed in the risk factor we are subject to risks related to taxation in multiple jurisdictions in item a of this report 
for and beyond  we anticipate the provision for income taxes to increase in absolute dollars but the effective tax rate to trend lower than the us federal statutory rate as the portion of our earnings subject to lower statutory tax rates increases 
the american taxpayer relief act of  which was signed into law on january   included the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research and development credit from january   through december  our provision for income taxes for the year ended december   did not include the impact of the federal research credit generated in since the law was enacted subsequent to our reporting period 
had the legislation been enacted in  the provision for income taxes for the year ended december   would have been reduced by approximately million 
our provision for income taxes in the first quarter of will include the tax benefit as a result of the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research credit for we ended with cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments totaling billion

table of contents program negatively impacted our gross margin by approximately in this trade in program was completed in q compared to gross margin increased in compared to during the period  the gross margin of our instrument sales improved  primarily driven by an increase in average selling price per instrument as our genome analyzer trade in program was substantially completed in the first half of the genome analyzer trade in program negatively impacted our gross margin by approximately and in and  respectively  based on the estimated amount of incremental sales incentive provided 
the gross margin of our consumable sales also increased as we experienced a shift in sales mix from lower gross margin microarray consumables to higher gross margin sequencing consumables  primarily due to the expansion of our sequencing instrument installed base 
the improvements in gross margins were partially offset by the negative impact from higher stock compensation expense and higher amortization expense of acquired intangible assets included in cost of revenue 
operating expense dollars in thousands change change change change research and development selling  general and administrative headquarter relocation expense unsolicited tender offer related expense restructuring charges acquisition related expense gain  net total operating expense compared to research and development expense increased by million  or  in from  primarily due to a million impairment loss recognized for ipr d recorded as a result of a prior acquisition and increased personnel expenses as we continue to increase our investment in projects to develop and commercialize new products 
in addition  we incurred increased facilities expenses in as the rental fees for our current headquarters are higher than our prior facility 
selling  general and administrative expense increased by million in from the increase is primarily driven by a million increase in personnel expenses associated with increased headcount  and a million increase in legal and other consulting fees 
personnel expenses included salaries  share based compensation  and benefits 
these increases in expense were partially offset by a million decrease in bad debt expense  as certain customer bankruptcies impacted us in in addition  we had the benefit of a million legal settlement gain recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses in in q  we completed the relocation of our headquarters that started in during  we incurred million in additional headquarter relocation expense  primarily consisting of cease use loss associated with vacating our prior headquarters  double rent expense during the transition to our new facility  and accretion of interest expense on the lease exit liability

compared to the effective tax rate in closely approximated the us statutory rate because a significant portion of our earnings was subject to us taxation 
the increase in the effective tax rate in from was primarily attributable to lower non taxable gains recorded on the changes in fair value of contingent consideration related to prior acquisitions and higher nondeductible acquired ipr d charges recorded in liquidity and capital resources at december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  a million increase from last year  due to the factors described in the cash flow summary below 
our primary source of liquidity has been cash flows from operations 
our ability to generate cash from operations provides us with the financial flexibility we need to meet operating  investing  and financing needs 
cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries at december  were approximately million 
it is our intention to indefinitely reinvest all current and future foreign earnings in foreign subsidiaries 
historically  we have liquidated our short term investments and or issued debt and equity securities to finance our business needs as a supplement to cash provided by operating activities 
at december   we have million in 
table of contents short term investments 
our short term investments include marketable securities consisting of debt securities in government sponsored entities  corporate debt securities  and us treasury notes

our board of directors has authorized several common stock repurchase programs 
in  we used million to repurchase our outstanding shares under these programs 
as of december   we had authorization from our board of directors to repurchase to an additional million of our common stock 
during  we used million of the net proceeds from the issuance of our notes to purchase million shares of our common stock in privately negotiated transactions concurrently with the issuance 
we also used part of the net proceeds for the extinguishment of million principal amount of our notes upon conversion 
we used the remaining net proceeds for other general corporate purposes  which included acquisitions and purchases of our common stock 
we expect that our revenue and the resulting operating income  as well as the status of each of our new product development programs  will significantly impact our cash management decisions 
we anticipate that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to fund our near term capital and operating needs for at least the next months  including the pending acquisition of verinata 
operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business  including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  including our ability to successfully commercialize and further develop our technologies and create innovative products in our markets  scientific progress in our research and development programs and the magnitude of those programs  competing technological and market developments  and the need to enter into collaborations with other companies or acquire other companies or technologies to enhance or complement our product and service offerings

off balance sheet arrangements we do not participate in any transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
during the fiscal year ended december   we were not involved in any off balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of the rules of the securities and exchange commission

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  market and other conditions  and various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact us in the future  the estimation process is  by its nature  uncertain given that estimates depend on events over which we may not have control 
if market and other conditions change from those that we anticipate  our consolidated financial statements may be materially affected 
in addition  if our assumptions change  we may need to revise our estimates  or take other corrective actions  either of which may also have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies and estimates have a higher degree of inherent uncertainty and require our most significant judgments 
in addition  had we used estimates different from any of these  our consolidated financial statements could have been materially different from those presented 
members of our senior management have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates  and our disclosure regarding them  with the audit committee of our board of directors 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note organization and significant accounting policies in part ii  item of this form k 
revenue recognition our revenue is generated primarily from the sale of products and services 
product revenue primarily consists of sales of instruments and consumables used in genetic analysis 
service and other revenue primarily consists of revenue from instrument service contract sales  genotyping and sequencing services  and amounts earned under research agreements with government grants  which are recognized in the period during which the related costs are incurred 
the timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors  including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations 
determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves significant judgments and estimates and actual results may differ from our estimates 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in instances where final acceptance of the product or system is required  revenue is deferred until all the acceptance criteria have been met 
all revenue is recorded net of any discounts 
revenue for product sales is recognized generally upon transfer of title to the customer  provided that no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue from instrument service contracts is recognized as the services are rendered  typically evenly over the contract term 
revenue from genotyping and sequencing services is recognized when earned  which is generally at the time the genotyping or sequencing analysis data is made available to the customer or agreed upon milestones are reached 
in order to assess whether the price is fixed or determinable  we evaluate whether refund rights exist 
if there are refund rights or payment terms based on future performance  we defer revenue recognition until the price becomes fixed or determinable 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection of a payment is not reasonably assured  revenue recognition is deferred until receipt of payment 
we regularly enter into contracts where revenue is derived from multiple deliverables including any mix of products or services 
these products or services are generally delivered within a short time frame  approximately three to six months  of the contract execution date 
revenue recognition for contracts with multiple deliverables is based on the individual units of accounting determined to exist in the contract 
a delivered item is considered a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis 
items are considered to have stand alone value when they are sold separately by any vendor or when the customer could resell the item on a stand alone basis 
for transactions with multiple deliverables  consideration is allocated at the inception of the contract to all deliverables based on their relative selling price 
the relative selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific objective 
table of contents evidence vsoe of selling price or third party evidence of selling price if vsoe does not exist 
if neither vsoe nor third party evidence exists  we use best estimate of the selling price for the deliverable 
in order to establish vsoe of selling price  we must regularly sell the product or service on a standalone basis with a substantial majority priced within a relatively narrow range 
vsoe of selling price is usually the midpoint of that range 
if there are not a sufficient number of standalone sales and vsoe of selling price cannot be determined  then we consider whether third party evidence can be used to establish selling price 
due to the lack of similar products and services sold by other companies within the industry  we have rarely established selling price using third party evidence 
if neither vsoe nor third party evidence of selling price exists  we determine our best estimate of selling price using average selling prices over a rolling month period coupled with an assessment of current market conditions 
if the product or service has no history of sales or if the sales volume is not sufficient  we rely upon prices set by our pricing committee adjusted for applicable discounts 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when we determine there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 
in  we offered an incentive with the launch of the hiseq that enabled existing genome analyzer customers to trade in their genome analyzer and receive a discount on the purchase of a hiseq the incentive was limited to customers who had purchased a genome analyzer as of the date of the announcement and was the first significant trade in program we have offered 
the genome analyzer trade in program was completed in we accounted for hiseq discounts related to the trade in program as reductions to revenue upon recognition of the hiseq sales revenue  which is later than the date the trade in program was launched 
in certain markets  the company sells products and provides services to customers through distributors that specialize in life science products 
in most sales through distributors  the product is delivered directly to customers 
in cases where the product is delivered to a distributor  revenue recognition is deferred until acceptance is received from the distributor  and or the end user  if required by the applicable sales contract 
the terms of sales transactions through distributors are consistent with the terms of direct sales to customers 
these transactions are accounted for in accordance with the company s revenue recognition policy described herein 
investments we invest in various types of securities  including debt securities in government sponsored entities  corporate debt securities  and us treasury securities 
as of december   we have million in short term investments 
in accordance with the accounting standard for fair value measurements  we classify our investments as level   or within the fair value hierarchy 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets that we have the ability to access 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices  interest rates and yield curves 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize unobservable data points for the asset 
as discussed in note fair value measurements in part ii  item of this form k  a majority of our security holdings have been classified as level these securities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued utilizing a third party service provider who assesses the fair value using inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly  such as yield curve  volatility factors  credit spreads  default rates  loss severity  current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments or debt  broker and dealer quotes  as well as other relevant economic measures 
we perform certain procedures to corroborate the fair value of these holdings  and in the process  we apply judgments and estimates that if changed  could significantly affect our results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
we regularly analyze customer accounts  review the length of time receivables are outstanding  review historical loss rates and assess current economic trends that may impact the level of credit losses in the future 
our gross trade accounts receivables totaled million and the allowance for doubtful accounts was million at december  our allowance for doubtful accounts has generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses 
however  since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  we may need to increase our reserves if the financial conditions of our customers deteriorate 

table of contents inventory valuation inventories are stated at lower of cost or market 
we record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess  obsolete  or impaired goods in order to state inventory at net realizable value 
we must make assumptions about future demand  market conditions  and the release of new products that will supersede old ones 
we regularly review inventory for excess and obsolete products and components  taking into account product life cycles  quality issues  historical experience  and usage forecasts 
our gross inventory totaled million and the cumulative adjustment for potentially excess and obsolete inventory was million at december  historically  our inventory adjustment has been adequate to cover our losses 
however  if actual market conditions are less favorable than anticipated  additional inventory adjustments could be required 
contingencies we are involved in various lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business  including actions with respect to intellectual property  employment  and contractual matters 
in connection with these matters  we assess  on a regular basis  the probability and range of possible loss based on the developments in these matters 
a liability is recorded in the financial statements if it is believed to be probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
because litigation is inherently unpredictable and unfavorable resolutions could occur  assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events 
we regularly review outstanding legal matters to determine the adequacy of the liabilities accrued and related disclosures in consideration of many factors  which include  but are not limited to  past history  scientific and other evidence  and the specifics and status of each matter 
we may change our estimates if our assessment of the various factors changes and the amount of ultimate loss may differ from our estimates  resulting in a material effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and or cash flows 
business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting  we allocate the fair value of the total consideration transferred to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition 
the fair values assigned  defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants  are based on estimates and assumptions determined by management 
we record the excess consideration over the aggregate fair value of tangible and intangible assets  net of liabilities assumed  as goodwill 
these valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
in connection with certain of our acquisitions  additional contingent consideration is earned by the sellers upon completion of certain future performance milestones 
in these cases  a liability is recorded on the acquisition date for an estimate of the acquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration by applying the income approach utilizing variable inputs such as anticipated future cash flows  risk free adjusted discount rates  and nonperformance risk 
any change in the fair value of the contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date is recognized in acquisition related expense gain  net  a component of operating expenses  in our consolidated statements of income 
this method requires significant management judgment  including the probability of achieving certain future milestones and discount rates 
future changes in our estimates could result in expenses or gains 
management typically uses the discounted cash flow method to value our acquired intangible assets 
this method requires significant management judgment to forecast future operating results and establish residual growth rates and discount factors 
the estimates we use to value and amortize intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages 
if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values  we could experience impairment charges 
in addition  we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense 
if our estimates of the economic lives change  depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 
intangible assets and other long lived assets impairment assessments we regularly perform reviews to determine if the carrying values of our long lived assets are impaired 
a review of identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets is performed when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment 
if indicators of impairment exist  we assess the recoverability of the affected long lived assets and compare their fair values to the respective carrying amounts 

table of contents in order to estimate the fair value of identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets  we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets 
the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows  the time value of money  and other factors that a willing market participant would consider 
significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
for example  if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units  we may be required to record future impairment charges for purchased intangible assets 
impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 
share based compensation we are required to measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payments based on estimated fair value 
we estimate the fair value of stock options granted and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan using the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model 
the fair value of our restricted stock units is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
the determination of fair value of share based awards using the bsm model requires the use of certain estimates and highly judgmental assumptions that affect the amount of share based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of income 
these include estimates of the expected volatility of our stock price  expected life of an award  expected dividends  and the risk free interest rate 
we determine the volatility of our stock price by equally weighing the historical and implied volatility of our common stock 
the historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period is generally commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock awards  adjusted for the impact of unusual fluctuations not reasonably expected to recur  and other relevant factors 
implied volatility is calculated from the implied market volatility of exchange traded call options on our common stock 
the expected life of an award is based on historical forfeiture experience  exercise activity  and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards 
we determined expected dividend yield to be given we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we currently do not anticipate paying such cash dividends 
the risk free interest rate is based upon us treasury securities with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the share based awards 
we amortize the fair value of share based compensation on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards 
if any of the assumptions used in the bsm model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially from what we have recorded in the current period 
warranties we generally provide a one year warranty on instruments 
additionally  we provide a warranty on consumables through the expiration date  which generally ranges from six to twelve months after the manufacture date 
we establish an accrual for estimated warranty expenses based on historical experience as well as anticipated product performance 
we periodically review the adequacy of our warranty reserve  and adjust  if necessary  the warranty percentage and accrual based on actual experience and estimated costs to be incurred 
if our estimates of warranty obligation change or if actual product performance is below our expectations we may incur additional warranty expense 
cease use loss upon exit of facility in  we completed the relocation of our headquarters to a new facility in san diego  california  and recorded headquarter relocation expense of million  the majority of which was attributable to a cease use loss recorded upon vacating our prior headquarter facility 
the lease on our prior headquarter facility expires in the cease use loss is calculated as the present value of the remaining lease obligation offset by estimated sublease rental receipts during the remaining lease period  adjusted for deferred items and leasehold improvements 
in calculating the cease use loss  management is required to make significant judgments to estimate the present value of future cash flows from the assumed sublease 
the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model include the amount and timing of estimated sublease rental receipts  and the risk adjusted discount rate 
these assumptions are subjective in nature and the actual future cash flows could differ from our estimates  resulting in significant adjustments to the cease use loss recorded 

table of contents income taxes our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
significant judgments and estimates based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations in the united states and the numerous foreign jurisdictions where we are subject to income tax are required in determining our provision for income taxes 
changes in tax laws  statutory tax rates  and estimates of the company s future taxable income could impact the deferred tax assets and liabilities provided for in the consolidated financial statements and would require an adjustment to the provision for income taxes 
deferred tax assets are regularly assessed to determine the likelihood they will be recovered from future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established when we believe it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of a deferred tax asset will not be achieved 
in evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction which they arise  we consider all available positive and negative evidence 
factors reviewed include the cumulative pre tax book income for the past three years  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  our history of earnings and reliability of our forecasts  projections of pre tax book income over the foreseeable future  and the impact of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
based on the available evidence as of december   we were not able to conclude it is more likely than not certain us deferred tax assets will be realized 
therefore  we recorded a valuation allowance of million against certain us deferred tax assets 
we recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
tax authorities regularly examine our returns in the jurisdictions in which we do business and we regularly assess the tax risk of the company s return filing positions 
due to the complexity of some of the uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different from our current estimate of the tax liability 
these differences  as well as any interest and penalties  will be reflected in the provision for income taxes in the period in which they are determined 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our investment portfolio is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
we have historically maintained a relatively short average maturity for our investment portfolio  and we believe a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments 
in addition  if a basis point change in overall interest rates were to occur in  our interest income would change by approximately million in relation to amounts we would expect to earn  based on our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments as of december  changes in interest rates may also impact gains or losses from the conversion of our outstanding convertible senior notes 
during  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes due at our election  the notes are convertible into cash  shares of our common stock  or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock in each case under certain circumstances  including trading price conditions related to our common stock 
if the trading price of our common stock reaches a price for a sustained period at above the conversion price of  the notes will become convertible 
upon conversion  we are required to record a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value of the debt to be extinguished and its corresponding net carrying value 
the fair value of the debt to be extinguished depends on our then current incremental borrowing rate 
if our incremental borrowing rate at the time of conversion is higher or lower than the implied interest rate of the notes  we will record a gain or loss in our consolidated statement of income during the period in which the notes are converted 
the implicit interest rate for the notes is 
an incremental borrowing rate that is a hypothetical basis points lower than the implicit interest rate upon conversion of million aggregate principal amount of the notes would result in a loss of approximately million 

table of contents market price sensitive instruments in order to reduce potential equity dilution  in connection with the issuance and potential conversion of our convertible senior notes due  we entered into convertible note hedge transactions  entitling us to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at a strike price of per share  subject to adjustment 
in addition  we sold to the hedge transaction counterparties warrants exercisable on a net share basis  for up to  shares of our common stock at a strike price of per share  subject to adjustment 
the anti dilutive effect of the note hedge transactions  if any  could be partially or fully offset to the extent the trading price of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants on the exercise dates of the warrants  which occur during  assuming the warrants are exercised 
foreign currency exchange risk we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the company s us dollar functional currency 
these transactions give rise to monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the value of these monetary assets and liabilities are subject to changes in currency exchange rates from the time the transactions are originated until settlement in cash 
our foreign currency exposures are primarily concentrated in the euro  yen  british pound sterling  australian dollar  and singapore dollar 
both realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of these monetary assets and liabilities are included in the determination of net income 
we recorded a million net currency exchange loss for the fiscal year ended december  on business transactions  net of hedging transactions  which are included in other expense income  net  in our consolidated statements of income 
we use forward exchange contracts to manage a portion of the foreign currency exposure risk for foreign subsidiaries with monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we only use derivative financial instruments to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks  we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we primarily use forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures  and they generally have terms of one month or less 
realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of financial contracts entered into to hedge the exchange rate exposure of these monetary assets and liabilities are also included in the determination of net income  as they have not been designated for hedge accounting 
these contracts  which settle monthly  effectively fix the exchange rate at which these specific monetary assets and liabilities will be settled  so that gains or losses on the forward contracts offset the losses or gains from changes in the value of the underlying monetary assets and liabilities 
as of december   the total notional amount of outstanding forward contracts in place for foreign currency purchases was approximately million
