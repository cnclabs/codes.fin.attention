our fiscal year begins on january and ends on december we analyze the results of our operations for the last three years  including the trends in the overall business followed by a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity  our credit facility  and contractual commitments

the forward looking statements in this section and other parts of this document involve risks and uncertainties including statements regarding our plans  objectives  goals  strategies  and financial performance 
our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of factors set forth under the caption safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of below

executive overview we are a leading designer  manufacturer and marketer of premium quality footwear and apparel marketed under a portfolio of well recognized brand names including rocky  georgia boot  durango  lehigh  and the licensed brands michelin and mossy oak 
our products are distributed through three distinct business segments wholesale  retail and military 
in our wholesale business  we distribute our products through a wide range of distribution channels representing over ten thousand retail store locations in the us and canada as well as in several international markets 
our wholesale channels vary by product line and include sporting goods stores  outdoor retailers  independent shoe retailers  hardware stores  catalogs  mass merchants  uniform stores  farm store chains  specialty safety stores and other specialty retailers 
our retail business includes direct sales of our products to consumers through our lehigh mobile stores and our websites 
we also sell footwear under the rocky label to the us military 
our growth strategy is founded substantially on the expansion of our brands into new footwear and apparel markets 
new products that we introduce may not be successful with consumers or one or more of our brands may fall out of favor with consumers 
if we are unable to anticipate  identify or react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences  we may not grow as fast as we plan to grow or our sales may decline  and our brand image and operating performance may suffer 
furthermore  achieving market acceptance for new products will likely require us to exert substantial product development and marketing efforts  which could result in a material increase in our selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses  and there can be no assurance that we will have the resources necessary to undertake such efforts 
material increases in our sg a expenses could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 
we may also encounter difficulties in producing new products that we did not anticipate during the development stage 
our development schedules for new products are difficult to predict and are subject to change as a result of shifting priorities in response to consumer preferences and competing products 
if we are not able to efficiently manufacture newly developed products in quantities sufficient to support retail distribution  we may not be able to recoup our investment in the development of new products 
failure to gain market acceptance for new products that we introduce could impede our growth  reduce our profits  adversely affect the image of our brands  erode our competitive position and result in long term harm to our business 
during  we began a project to implement a new enterprise resources planning erp system to replace our current system 
as part of this implementation  we have invested over million into the project 
during  we completed a majority of this implementation and expect to be completed by mid with the final phase of the project 
if we fail to properly execute and complete the implementation of this system  we could be adversely impacted both financially and operationally

as a result of these actions  we recorded pension termination charges totaling million and an income tax benefit of million 
interest expense 
interest expense was million in  compared to million for the prior year 
the decrease of million resulted primarily from the repayment of a million term note carrying interest at a rate of and the increased write off of fees in this repayment was made with million of proceeds from our may equity offering as well as million of borrowings from our new line of credit which generally carries an interest rate of libor plus basis points

s income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources overview our principal sources of liquidity have been our income from operations and borrowings under our credit facility and other indebtedness 
over the last several years our principal uses of cash have been for working capital and capital expenditures to support our growth 
our working capital consists primarily of trade receivables and inventory  offset by accounts payable and accrued expenses 
our working capital fluctuates throughout the year as a result of our seasonal business cycle and business expansion and is generally lowest in the months of january through march of each year and highest during the months of may through october of each year 
we typically utilize our revolving credit facility to fund our seasonal working capital requirements 
as a result  balances on our revolving credit facility will fluctuate significantly throughout the year 
our working capital decreased to million at december   compared to million at the end of the prior year 
our capital expenditures relate primarily to projects relating to our corporate offices  property  merchandising fixtures  molds and equipment associated with our manufacturing operations and for information technology 
capital expenditures were million for and million in capital expenditures for are anticipated to be approximately million 
in october  we entered into a financing agreement with pnc bank pnc to provide a million credit facility 
the term of the facility is five years and the current interest rate is generally libor plus 
in april  we repaid the remaining balance of approximately million on our mortgage loans by borrowing under a sub facility on the pnc credit facility 
the sub facility is secured by real estate owned by us 
in connection with this transaction  we incurred approximately million of prepayment and other fees that were reported as additional interest expense in the second quarter of the mortgage loans were incurring interest at and were replaced with borrowings under the credit facility for a current interest rate of libor plus 
the total amount available under our revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base calculation based on various percentages of accounts receivable and inventory 
as of december   we had million in borrowings under this facility and total capacity of million 
our credit facility contains a restrictive covenant which requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio 
this restrictive covenant is only in effect upon a triggering event taking place as defined in the credit facility agreement 
at december   there was no triggering event and the covenant was not in effect 
our credit facility places a restriction on the amount of dividends that may be paid 
no cash dividends were paid in  or we believe that our credit facility coupled with cash generated from operations will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
our continued liquidity  however  is contingent upon future operating performance  cash flows and our ability to meet financial covenants under our credit facility 
based on our expected borrowings for  a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would result  over the subsequent twelve month period  in a reduction of approximately million in income before income taxes and cash flows 
the estimated reductions are based upon the current level of variable debt and assume no changes in the composition of that debt 
cash flows cash flow summary in millions cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net change in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million for  compared to million for  and million for the principal sources of net cash in included higher net income  increases in accounts payable and decreases in accounts receivable  which were partially offset by higher balances of inventory and accrued liabilities 
the principal sources of net cash in included higher net income and decreases in accounts receivable  which were partially offset by the million in pension contributions to fund and terminate the defined benefit pension plan  higher balances of inventory and reduced accounts payable 
the principal sources of net cash in included higher net income and increases in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities  partially offset by slightly higher balances of inventory and accounts receivable 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in and million in the principal use of cash in  and was for the purchase of molds and equipment associated with our manufacturing operations and for information technology software and system upgrades 
financing activities 
cash used in financing activities during was million compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in and cash used in financing activities of million in proceeds and repayments of the revolving credit facility reflect daily cash disbursement and deposit activity 
our financing activities during included net repayments under the revolving line of credit facility of million 
our financing activities during included net borrowings under the revolving line of credit facility of million and repayments on long term debt of million 
during  we repaid our long term real estate obligations with borrowings under the revolving line of credit 
our financing activities during included million of proceeds from the aforementioned issuance of common stock  net borrowings under the revolving line of credit facility of million  repayments on long term debt of million and debt financing costs of million 
borrowings and external sources of funds our borrowings and external sources of funds were as follows at december  and december in millions revolving credit facility less current maturities net long term debt we continually evaluate our external credit arrangements in light of our growth strategy and new opportunities 
in october  we entered into a financing agreement with pnc bank to provide a million credit facility 
the term of the credit facility is five years and the interest rate is currently libor plus 
we lease certain machinery  trucks  shoe centers  and manufacturing facilities under operating leases that generally provide for renewal options 
future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases are million  million  million  million and million for years through  respectively  or approximately million in total 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  resulting from financial contracts and commitments 
we have not included information on our recurring purchases of materials for use in our manufacturing operations 
these amounts are generally consistent from year to year  closely reflect our levels of production  and are not long term in nature less than three months 
contractual obligations at december  payments due by year millions total less than year years years over years long term debt minimum operating lease commitments minimum royalty commitments expected cash requirements for interest total contractual obligations assumes a interest rate  which is the highest rate possible as of december  on the million revolving credit facility 
from time to time  we enter into purchase commitments with our suppliers under customary purchase order terms 
any significant losses implicit in these contracts would be recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
at december   no such losses existed 
our ongoing business activities continue to be subject to compliance with various laws  rules and regulations as may be issued and enforced by various federal  state and local agencies 
with respect to environmental matters  costs are incurred pertaining to regulatory compliance 
such costs have not been  and are not anticipated to become  material 
we are contingently liable with respect to lawsuits  taxes and various other matters that routinely arise in the normal course of business 
we do not have off balance sheet arrangements  financings  or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons  also known as variable interest entities 
additionally  we do not have any related party transactions that materially affect the results of operations  cash flow or financial condition 
inflation our financial performance is influenced by factors such as higher raw material costs as well as higher salaries and employee benefits 
management attempts to minimize or offset the effects of inflation through increased selling prices  productivity improvements  and cost reductions 
we were able to mitigate the effects of inflation during  and due to these factors 
it is anticipated that inflationary pressures during will be offset through price increases that were implemented in the later part of critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
our management regularly reviews our accounting policies to make certain they are current and also provide readers of the consolidated financial statements with useful and reliable information about our operating results and financial condition 
these include  but are not limited to  matters related to accounts receivable  inventories  intangibles  pension benefits and income taxes 
implementation of these accounting policies includes estimates and judgments by management based on historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable 
this may include judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities based on considerations that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our management believes the following critical accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue principally consists of sales to customers  and  to a lesser extent  license fees 
revenue is recognized when goods are shipped and title passes to the customer  while license fees are recognized when earned 
customer sales are recorded net of allowances for estimated returns  trade promotions and other discounts  which are recognized as a deduction from sales at the time of sale 
accounts receivable allowances management maintains allowances for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts is calculated based on the relative age and size of trade receivable balances 
sales returns and allowances we record a reduction to gross sales based on estimated customer returns and allowances 
these reductions are influenced by historical experience  based on customer returns and allowances 
the actual amount of sales returns and allowances realized may differ from our estimates 
if we determine that sales returns or allowances should be either increased or decreased  then the adjustment would be made to net sales in the period in which such a determination is made 
sales returns and allowances for sales returns were approximately of sales for and of sales for inventories management identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate loss provisions related to these inventories 
historically  these loss provisions have not been significant as the vast majority of our inventories are considered saleable and we have been able to liquidate slow moving or obsolete inventories at amounts above cost through our factory outlet stores or through various discounts to customers 
should management encounter difficulties liquidating slow moving or obsolete inventories  additional provisions may be necessary 
management regularly reviews the adequacy of our inventory reserves and makes adjustments to them as required 
intangible assets intangible assets  including goodwill  trademarks and patents are reviewed for impairment annually  and more frequently  if necessary 
we perform such testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each year or as events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount 
in assessing whether indefinite lived intangible assets are impaired  we must make certain estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows  long term growth rates of our business  operating margins  weighted average cost of capital and other factors such as  discount rates  royalty rates  cost of capital  and market multiples to determine the fair value of our assets 
these estimates and assumptions require management s judgment  and changes to these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or impairment for each of our other indefinite lived intangible assets 
future events could cause us to conclude that indications of intangible asset impairment exist 
impairment may result from  among other things  deterioration in the performance of our business  adverse market conditions  adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations  competition  or the sale or disposition of a reporting segment 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
pension benefits accounting for pensions involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works 
to accomplish this  extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation  investment returns  mortality  turnover and discount rates 
these assumptions are reviewed annually 
see note  retirement plans  to the consolidated financial statements for information on our plan and the assumptions used 
pension expenses are determined by actuaries using assumptions concerning the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase 
an actuarial analysis of benefit obligations and plan assets is determined as of december each year 
the funded status of our plan and reconciliation of accrued pension cost is determined annually as of december actual results would be different using other assumptions 
on december  we froze the noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for all non us territorial employees 
in the fourth quarter of  we fully funded and terminated the pension plan 
income taxes management has recorded a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets for a portion of state and local income tax net operating losses that it believes may not be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  however  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
at december   approximately million of undistributed earnings remains that would become taxable upon repatriation to the united states 
recent financial accounting pronouncements recently adopted accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting and standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 receivables topic a creditor s determination of whether a restructuring is a troubled debt restructuring 
the fasb believes the guidance in this asu will improve financial reporting by creating greater consistency in the way gaap is applied for various types of debt restructurings 
the asu clarifies which loan modifications constitute troubled debt restructurings 
it is intended to assist creditors in determining whether a modification of the terms of a receivable meets the criteria to be considered a troubled debt restructuring  both for purposes of recording an impairment loss and for disclosure of troubled debt restructurings 
in evaluating whether a restructuring constitutes a troubled debt restructuring  a creditor must separately conclude that both of the following exist a the restructuring constitutes a concession  and b the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties 
the amendments to fasb accounting standards codification codification topic  receivables  clarify the guidance on a creditor s evaluation of whether it has granted a concession and whether a debtor is experiencing financial difficulties 
the guidance was effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after june   and applies retrospectively to restructurings occurring on or after the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
this asu represents the converged guidance of the fasb and the iasb the boards on fair value measurement 
the collective efforts of the boards and their staffs  reflected in asu  have resulted in common requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements  including a consistent meaning of the term fair value 
the boards have concluded the common requirements will result in greater comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap and ifrss 
the amendments in this asu are to be applied prospectively

in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
the amendments in this update will allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
under these amendments  an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the amendments include a number of events and circumstances for an entity to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
under the amendments to topic  an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in both choices  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
this update eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the amendments in this update do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
the amendments in this update should be applied retrospectively 
for public entities  the amendments are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption is permitted  because compliance with the amendments is already permitted 
the amendments do not require any transition disclosures 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
accounting standards not yet adopted in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the update does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements 
however  the update requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
in addition  an entity is required to present  either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for other amounts that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures required under us gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts 
the amendments are effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december  we are currently assessing the potential impact of the adoption of this amendment on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures
