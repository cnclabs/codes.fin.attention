item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the forward looking statements included below the table of contents  risk factors  selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
overview prudential financial has two classes of common stock outstanding 
the common stock  which is publicly traded nyse pru  reflects the performance of the financial services businesses  while the class b stock  which was issued through a private placement and does not trade on any exchange  reflects the performance of the closed block business 
the financial services businesses and the closed block business are discussed below 
financial services businesses our financial services businesses consist of three operating divisions  which together encompass six segments  and our corporate and other operations 
the us retirement solutions and investment management division consists of our individual annuities  retirement and asset management segments 
the us individual life and group insurance division consists of our individual life and group insurance segments 
the international insurance division consists of our international insurance segment 
our corporate and other operations include corporate items and initiatives that are not allocated to business segments  as well as businesses that have been or will be divested 
we attribute financing costs to each segment based on the amount of financing used by each segment  excluding financing costs associated with corporate debt which are reflected in corporate and other operations 
the net investment income of each segment includes earnings on the amount of capital that management believes is necessary to support the risks of that segment 

table of contents we seek growth internally and through acquisitions  joint ventures or other forms of business combinations or investments 
our principal acquisition focus is in our current business lines  both domestic and international 
closed block business in connection with the demutualization  we ceased offering domestic participating products 
the liabilities for our traditional domestic in force participating products were segregated  together with assets  in a regulatory mechanism referred to as the closed block 
the closed block is designed generally to provide for the reasonable expectations for future policy dividends after demutualization of holders of participating individual life insurance policies and annuities included in the closed block by allocating assets that will be used exclusively for payment of benefits  including policyholder dividends  expenses and taxes with respect to these products 
see note to the consolidated financial statements and business demutualization and separation of business for more information on the closed block 
revenues and expenses we earn our revenues principally from insurance premiums  mortality  expense  asset management and administrative fees from insurance and investment products  and investment of general account and other funds 
we earn premiums primarily from the sale of individual life insurance  group life and disability insurance  and certain annuity contracts 
we earn mortality  expense  and asset management fees primarily from the sale and servicing of separate account products including variable life insurance and variable annuities  and from the sale and servicing of other products including universal life insurance 
we also earn asset management and administrative fees from the distribution  servicing and management of mutual funds  retirement products and other asset management products and services 
our operating expenses principally consist of insurance benefits provided and reserves established for anticipated future insurance benefits  general business expenses  dividends to policyholders  commissions and other costs of selling and servicing the various products we sell and interest credited on general account liabilities 
profitability our profitability depends principally on our ability to price our insurance and annuity products at a level that enables us to earn a margin over the costs associated with providing benefits and administering those products 
profitability also depends on  among other items  our actuarial and policyholder behavior experience on insurance and annuity products  our ability to attract and retain customer assets  generate and maintain favorable investment results  effectively deploy capital and utilize our tax capacity  and manage expenses 
historically  the participating products included in the closed block have yielded lower returns on capital invested than many of our other businesses 
as we have ceased offering domestic participating products  we expect that the proportion of the traditional participating products in our in force business will gradually diminish as these older policies age  and we grow other businesses 
however  the relatively lower returns to us on this existing block of business will continue to affect our consolidated results of operations for many years 
our common stock reflects the performance of our financial services businesses  but there can be no assurance that the market value of the common stock will reflect solely the performance of these businesses 
see risk factors for a discussion of risks that have affected and may affect in the future our business  results of operations or financial condition  cause the trading price of our common stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
executive summary prudential financial  a financial services leader with approximately trillion of assets under management as of december   has operations in the united states  asia  europe and latin america 
through our subsidiaries and affiliates  we offer a wide array of financial products and services  including life 
table of contents insurance  annuities  retirement related services  mutual funds  and investment management 
we offer these products and services to individual and institutional customers through one of the largest distribution networks in the financial services industry 
industry trends our us and international businesses are impacted by financial markets  economic conditions  regulatory oversight  and a variety of trends that affect the industries where we compete 
us businesses financial and economic environment 
although economic and financial conditions continue to show signs of improvement  global market conditions and uncertainty continue to be factors in the markets in which we operate 
this uncertainty  particularly in the equity markets  has led to  among other things  increased demand for guaranteed retirement income  fixed income and stable value products  and defined benefit risk transfer solutions 
the continued low interest rate environment continues to negatively impact our portfolio income yields  as discussed further below  and continued high unemployment rates and limited growth in salaries also continue to be factors impacting certain business drivers  including contributions to defined contribution plans and the costs of group disability claims 
regulatory environment 
financial market dislocations have produced  and are expected to continue to produce  extensive changes in existing laws and regulations  and regulatory frameworks applicable to our businesses 
in addition  state insurance laws regulate all aspects of our us insurance businesses and our insurance products are substantially affected by federal and state tax laws 
insurance regulators have begun to implement significant changes in the way in which industry participants must determine statutory reserves and statutory capital  particularly for products with embedded options and guarantees such as variable annuities and universal life products with secondary guarantees 
demographics 
income protection  wealth accumulation and the needs of retiring baby boomers continue to shape the insurance industry 
retirement security is one of the most critical issues in the us for individuals and the investment professionals and institutions that support them 
the risk and responsibility of retirement savings continues to shift to employees  away from the government and employers 
life insurance ownership among us households has reached its lowest point in fifty years  with consumers citing other financial priorities and cost of insurance as reasons for the lack of coverage 
competitive environment 
for the annuities business  traditional competitors continue to take actions to either exit the marketplace or de risk products in response to recent market volatility 
new non traditional competitors are beginning to enter this marketplace 
in  we implemented modifications to scale back benefits and increase pricing for certain product features 
we believe our current product offerings are competitively positioned and that our differentiated risk management strategies will provide us with an attractive risk and profitability profile 
all of our new variable annuity sales  as well as a significant portion of our in force business  where an optional living benefit has been elected  include an automatic rebalancing feature  which is a feature that is valued in the variable annuity market 
our retirement and asset management businesses compete on price  service and investment performance 
the full service retirement markets are mature  with few dominant players 
we have seen a trend toward unbundling of the purchase decision related to the recordkeeping and investment offerings  where the variety of available funds and their performance are the key selection criteria of plan sponsors and intermediaries 
additionally  changes in the regulatory environment have driven more transparent fee disclosures  which have heightened pricing pressures and may accelerate the trend toward unbundling of services 
market disruption and rating agency downgrades have caused some of our institutional investment product competitors to withdraw from the market  creating significant growth opportunities for us in certain markets  including the investment only stable value market 
the recovery of the equity  fixed income  and commercial real estate markets has positively impacted asset managers by increasing assets under management and corresponding fee levels 
in 
table of contents addition  institutional fixed income managers have generally experienced positive flows as investors have re allocated assets into fixed income to reduce risk  including the reduction of risk in pension plans 
in  we closed two significant pension risk transfer transactions  which potentially changes the landscape for how plan sponsors consider their pension risk alternatives 
the longevity risk associated with these transactions complements our mortality risk businesses 
the individual life and group life and disability markets are mature and  due to the large number of competitors  competition is driven mainly by price and service 
the economy has exacerbated pressure on pricing  creating a challenge of maintaining pricing discipline 
in the individual life market  many of our competitors took pricing actions in in response to the low interest rate environment  following our own price increases implemented in and our individual life sales in benefited from a strong competitive position as a result of these competitor actions 
maintaining this competitive positioning is dependent on sources of financing for the reserves associated with this business and timely utilization of the associated tax benefits 
for group products  rate guarantees have become the industry norm  with rate guarantee durations trending upward  primarily for group life insurance  as a general industry practice 
there is also an increased demand from clients for bundling of products and services to streamline administration and save costs by dealing with fewer carriers 
as employers are attempting to control costs and shift benefit decisions and funding to employees  who continue to value benefits offered in the workplace  employee pay voluntary product offerings and services are becoming increasingly important in the group market 
for the long term care business  many companies  including prudential  have taken actions in response to the continued low interest rate environment including exiting the marketplace  seeking premium rate increases and changing plan designs 
in  we announced our decision to cease sales of long term care products reflecting our desire to focus our efforts on our core group life and disability lines of business 
international businesses financial and economic environment 
our international insurance operations  especially in japan  continue to operate in the low interest rate environment described below 
however  the local market has adapted to the low rate environment in japan 
the continued low interest rate environment in the us may impact the attractiveness of us dollar denominated products in japan relative to yen denominated products 
we are also subject to financial impacts associated with movements in foreign currency rates  particularly the japanese yen 
fluctuations in the value of the yen will continue to impact the relative attractiveness of non yen products marketed in japan 
regulatory environment 
in april  japanese tax law changed to reduce deductibility of premiums on certain insurance products 
this resulted in dislocations in the tax sensitive marketplace and elevated sales of these products prior to the effective date of the tax law change and reduced sales thereafter 
the financial services agency  the insurance regulator in japan  has implemented revisions to the solvency margin requirements for certain assets and has changed the manner in which an insurance company s core capital is calculated 
these changes were effective for the fiscal year ending march  we anticipate further changes in solvency regulation from jurisdiction to jurisdiction based on regulatory developments in the us  the european union  and recommendations by an international standard setting body for the insurance regulators  as well as regulatory requirements for those companies deemed to be systemically important financial institutions  or sifis  in the us or abroad 
in addition  local regulators  including in japan  may apply heightened scrutiny to non domestic companies 
internationally  regulators are also increasingly adopting measures to provide greater consumer protection and privacy rights 
demographics 
japan has an aging population as well as a large pool of household assets invested in low yielding deposit and savings vehicles 
the aging of japan s population as well as strains on government pension programs have led to a growing demand for insurance products with a significant savings element to meet savings and retirement needs as the population transitions to retirement 
these products have higher premiums with more of a savings component 
we are seeing a similar shift to retirement oriented products in korea and taiwan  each of which also has an aging population 
competitive environment 
the life insurance markets in japan and korea are mature 
we generally compete more on distribution capabilities and service provided to customers than on price 
the aging of 
table of contents japan s population creates an increasing need for product innovation  introducing insurance products which allow for savings and income as the population transitions to retirement 
in our japanese bank channel we experienced elevated sales of yen denominated single premium reduced death benefit whole life products during periods when competitors capped their sales of similar investment oriented products 
the ability to sell through multiple and complementary distribution channels is a competitive advantage 
however  competition for sales personnel as well as access to third party distribution channels is intense 
impact of low interest rate environment the low interest rate environment in the us has resulted in our current reinvestment yields being lower than the overall portfolio income yield  primarily for our investments in fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans 
with the federal reserve board s intention to keep interest rates low through at least  our portfolio income yields are expected to continue to decline in future periods 
for the domestic financial services businesses general account  we expect annual scheduled payments and pre payments to be approximately of the fixed maturity security and commercial mortgage loan portfolios through the domestic financial services businesses general account has approximately billion of such assets based on net carrying value as of december  as these assets mature  the current average portfolio income yield for fixed maturities and commercial mortgage loans of approximately is expected to decline due to reinvesting in a lower interest rate environment 
the reinvestment of scheduled payments and pre payments at rates below the current portfolio yield  including in some cases  at rates below those guaranteed under our insurance contracts  will impact future operating results to the extent we do not  or are unable to  reduce crediting rates on in force blocks of business  or effectively utilize other asset liability management strategies described below  in order to maintain current net interest margins 
as of december   our domestic financial services businesses have approximately billion of insurance liabilities and policyholder account balances 
of this amount  approximately billion represents contracts with guaranteed minimum crediting rates 
the following table sets forth our contracts in the domestic financial services businesses with guaranteed minimum crediting rates  and the related range of the difference between interest rates being credited to contractholders on these balances as of december  and the respective minimum guaranteed rates 
account value of total in billions contracts at guaranteed minimum crediting rate contracts above guaranteed minimum crediting rate by greater than total contracts with minimum guaranteed crediting rates for the contracts above guaranteed minimum crediting rates  although we have the ability to lower crediting rates  our willingness to do so may be limited by competitive pressures 
our domestic financial services businesses also have approximately billion of insurance liabilities and policyholder account balances representing participating contracts for which the investment income risk is expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders 
the crediting rates for these contracts are periodically adjusted based on the yield earned on the related assets 
the remaining billion of the billion of insurance liabilities and policyholder account balances in our domestic financial services businesses represents long duration products such as group annuities  structured settlements and other insurance products that do not have stated crediting rate guarantees  but have fixed and guaranteed terms  for which underlying assets may have to be reinvested at interest rates that are lower than portfolio rates 
we seek to mitigate the impact of a prolonged low interest rate environment on these contracts through asset liability management  as discussed further below 
for the domestic financial services businesses general account  assuming a hypothetical scenario where the average year us treasury rate is for the period from january  through december   
table of contents and credit spreads remain unchanged from levels as of december   we estimate that the unfavorable impact to net interest margins included in pre tax adjusted operating income of reinvesting in such an environment  compared to reinvesting at current average portfolio income yields  would be approximately million in and million in this impact is largely concentrated in the retirement and individual annuities segments 
this hypothetical scenario only reflects the impact related to the approximately billion of contracts with guaranteed minimum crediting rates shown above  and does not reflect i any benefit from potential changes to the crediting rates on the corresponding contractholder liabilities where the company has the contractual ability to do so  or other potential mitigants such as changes in investment mix that we may implement as funds are reinvested  ii any impact related to assets that do not directly support our liabilities  iii any impact from other factors  including but not limited to  new business  contractholder behavior  changes in competitive conditions  and changes in capital markets  and or iv any impact from other factors described below 
in order to mitigate the unfavorable impact that the current interest rate environment has on our net interest margins  we employ a proactive asset liability management program  which includes strategic asset allocation and derivative strategies within a disciplined risk management framework 
these strategies seek to match the characteristics of our products  and to closely approximate the interest rate sensitivity of the assets with the estimated interest rate sensitivity of the product liabilities 
our asset liability management program also helps manage duration gaps  currency and other risks between assets and liabilities through the use of derivatives 
we adjust this dynamic process as products change  as customer behavior changes and as changes in the market environment occur 
as a result  our asset liability management process has permitted us to manage interest sensitive products successfully through several market cycles 
our interest rate exposure is also mitigated by our business mix  as we have relatively limited exposure to lines of business in which net interest margin plays a more prominent role in product profitability  such as fixed annuities and universal life  which represents a limited portion of our individual life business in force 
in addition  within our retirement business  a substantial portion of our stable value account values have very low crediting rate floors 
our japanese insurance operations have experienced a prolonged low interest rate environment for many years 
these operations issue recurring payment and single premium products that are denominated in both japanese yen and us dollars  as well as fixed annuity products that are denominated in us dollars 
for the japanese yen denominated products  the exposure to decreased interest rates is limited as our japanese insurance operations have considered the prolonged low interest rate environment in product pricing  and a rigorous asset liability management program  which includes our duration management and crediting rate strategies  further limits our exposure 
for the us dollar denominated recurring payment products  our exposure to low interest rates in the us is also limited by our asset liability management program 
for the us dollar denominated single premium and fixed annuity products  the risk of reduced interest rates is limited  as new fixed annuity contracts are re priced frequently and pricing for other products is reviewed and updated regularly to reflect current market interest rates 
current developments effective january   the company adopted  retrospectively  the amended authoritative guidance issued by the fasb to address which costs relating to the acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts qualify for deferral 
the company has applied the retrospective method of adoption 
in addition  in december  the company adopted retrospectively a change in method of applying an accounting principle for the company s pension plans 
the change in accounting method relates to the calculation of market related value of pension plan assets used to determine net periodic pension cost 
all historical financial information presented has been revised to reflect these changes 
for further information  see accounting policies and pronouncements adoption of new accounting pronouncements and note to the consolidated financial statements

retirement 
segment results for increased in comparison to the increase primarily reflects the favorable impact of a legal settlement in  as well as higher asset based fee income and net investment spread results

table of contents accounting policies pronouncements application of critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or us gaap  requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment 
management  on an ongoing basis  reviews estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements 
if management determines that modifications in assumptions and estimates are appropriate given current facts and circumstances  results of operations and financial position as reported in the consolidated financial statements could change significantly 
the following sections discuss the accounting policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments 
deferred policy acquisition and other costs we capitalize costs that are directly related to the acquisition or renewal of insurance and annuity contracts 
these costs primarily include commissions  as well as costs of policy issuance and underwriting and certain other expenses that are directly related to successfully negotiated contracts 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the new authoritative guidance adopted effective january   regarding which costs relating to the acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts qualify for deferral 
we have also deferred costs associated with sales inducements related to our variable and fixed annuity contracts primarily within our individual annuities segment 
sales inducements are amounts that are credited to the policyholder s account balance as an inducement to purchase the contract 
for additional information about sales inducements  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we amortize these deferred policy acquisition costs  or dac  and deferred sales inducements  or dsi  over the expected lives of the contracts  based on our estimates of the level and timing of gross margins  gross profits  or gross premiums  depending on the type of contract 
as described in more detail below  in calculating dac and dsi amortization  we are required to make assumptions about investment returns  mortality  persistency  and other items that impact our estimates of the level and timing of gross margins  gross profits  or gross premiums 
we also periodically evaluate the recoverability of our dac and dsi 
for certain contracts  this evaluation is performed as part of our premium deficiency testing  as discussed further below in policyholder liabilities 
as of december   dac and dsi in our financial services businesses were billion and billion  respectively  and dac in our closed block business was million 
amortization methodologies dac associated with the traditional participating products of our closed block business is amortized over the expected lives of those contracts in proportion to estimated gross margins 
gross margins consider premiums  investment returns  benefit claims  costs for policy administration  changes in reserves  and dividends to policyholders 
we evaluate our estimates of future gross margins and adjust the related dac balance with a corresponding charge or credit to current period earnings for the effects of actual gross margins and changes in our expected future gross margins 
dac adjustments generally have not created significant volatility in our results of operations since many of the factors that affect gross margins are also included in the determination of our dividends to these policyholders and  during most years  the closed block has recognized a cumulative policyholder dividend obligation expense in policyholders dividends  for the excess of actual cumulative earnings over expected cumulative earnings as determined at the time of demutualization 
however  if actual cumulative earnings fall below expected cumulative earnings in future periods  thereby eliminating the cumulative policyholder dividend obligation expense  changes in gross margins and dac amortization would result in a net impact to the closed block business results of operations 
as of december   the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected cumulative earnings was million 
dac associated with the non participating whole life and term life policies of our individual life segment and the whole life  term life  endowment and health policies of our international insurance segment is amortized in proportion to gross premiums 

table of contents dac and dsi associated with the variable and universal life policies of our individual life and international insurance segments and the variable and fixed annuity contracts of our individual annuities and international insurance segments are amortized over the expected life of these policies in proportion to total gross profits 
in calculating gross profits  we consider mortality  persistency  and other elements as well as rates of return on investments associated with these contracts and the costs related to our guaranteed minimum death and guaranteed minimum income benefits 
total gross profits include both actual experience and estimates of gross profits for future periods 
we regularly evaluate and adjust the related dac and dsi balances with a corresponding charge or credit to current period earnings for the impact of actual gross profits and changes in our assumptions regarding estimated future gross profits on our dac and dsi amortization rates 
adjustments to the dac and dsi balances include the impact to our estimate of total gross profits of the annual review of assumptions  our quarterly adjustments for current period experience  and our quarterly adjustments for market performance 
each of these adjustments is further discussed below in annual assumptions review and quarterly adjustments 
we include the impact of the embedded derivatives associated with certain of the optional living benefit features of our variable annuity contracts and related hedging activities in actual gross profits used as the basis for calculating current period amortization 
we include only certain of these impacts in our best estimate of gross profits used to determine dac and dsi amortization rates 
beginning in  we include the difference between the change in the fair value of hedge positions and the change in the value of an internally defined hedge target in our best estimate of total gross profits used for determining amortization rates each quarter  without regard to the permanence of the changes 
in and the second half of  we included these impacts only to the extent this net amount was determined by management to be other than temporary 
prior to changing our hedging strategy to incorporate the internally defined hedge target in the second half of  we considered the change in the fair value of hedge positions and the change in the embedded derivative liability as defined under us gaap  excluding the impact of the market perceived risk of our own non performance  each quarter in determining amortization rates 
these changes over time reflect our regular review of the estimated profitability of our business  changes in our hedging strategy and other factors 
for additional information on our internally defined hedge target  as well as the current period impact of resetting amortization rates for this activity  see results of operations for financial services businesses by segment us retirement solutions and investment management division individual annuities variable annuity living benefits hedging program results 
annual assumptions review and quarterly adjustments annually  during the third quarter  we perform a comprehensive review of the assumptions used in estimating gross profits for future periods 
although we review these assumptions on an ongoing basis throughout the year  we generally only update these assumptions and adjust the dac and dsi balances during the third quarter  unless a material change that we feel is indicative of a long term trend is observed in an interim period 
over the last several years  the company s most significant assumption updates resulting in a change to expected future gross profits and the amortization of dac and dsi have been related to lapse experience and other contractholder behavior assumptions  mortality  and revisions to expected future rates of returns on investments 
we expect these assumptions to be the ones most likely to cause potential significant changes in the future 
the impact on our results of operations of changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time 
the quarterly adjustments for current period experience referred to above reflect the impact of differences between actual gross profits for a given period and the previously estimated expected gross profits for that period 
to the extent each period s actual experience differs from the previous estimate for that period  the assumed level of total gross profits may change 
in these cases  we recognize a cumulative adjustment to all previous periods amortization  also referred to as an experience true up adjustment 
the quarterly adjustments for market performance referred to above reflect the impact of changes to our estimate of total gross profits to reflect actual fund performance 
a significant portion of gross profits for our variable annuity contracts and  to a lesser degree  our variable life policies are dependent upon the total rate of return on assets held in separate account investment options 
this rate of return influences the fees we earn  costs we incur associated with the guaranteed minimum death and guaranteed minimum income benefit features 
table of contents related to our variable annuity contracts  as well as other sources of profit 
returns that are higher than our expectations for a given period produce higher than expected account balances  which increase the future fees we expect to earn and decrease the future costs we expect to incur associated with the guaranteed minimum death and guaranteed minimum income benefit features related to our variable annuity contracts 
the opposite occurs when returns are lower than our expectations 
the changes in future expected gross profits are used to recognize a cumulative adjustment to all prior periods amortization 
the near term future rate of return assumptions used in evaluating dac and dsi for our domestic variable annuity and variable life insurance products are derived using a reversion to the mean approach  a common industry practice 
under this approach  we consider the actual historical economic returns over a period of time and initially adjust future projected returns over the next four years the near term so that the assets are projected to grow at the long term expected rate of return for the entire period 
if the near term projected future rate of return is greater than our near term maximum future rate of return  we use our maximum future rate of return 
the weighted average rate of return assumptions for these businesses consider many factors specific to each business  including asset durations  asset allocations and other factors 
we update the near term rates of return and our estimate of total gross profits each quarter to reflect the result of the reversion to the mean approach  which assumes a convergence to the long term expected rates of return 
these market performance related adjustments to our estimate of total gross profits result in cumulative adjustments to prior amortization  reflecting the application of the new required rate of amortization to all prior periods gross profits 
the new required rate of amortization is also applied prospectively to future gross profits in calculating amortization in future periods 
as of december   our variable annuities business utilizes distinct rates of return for equity and fixed income investments 
assumptions for this business reflect an long term equity expected rate of return and a near term mean reversion equity rate of return of 
as of december   all contract groups within our variable annuities business utilized these rates  as the near term mean reversion equity rate of return was less than our maximum 
fixed income expected rates of return include a risk free return plus a credit spread and consider the duration and credit profile of the respective bond funds 
fixed income returns reflect a grading from current rates up to long term rates over a ten year period 
the weighted average fixed income expected rate of return after the ten year grading period is 
as of december   our variable life insurance business utilizes blended rates of return  which are based on a long term expected distribution of funds between equity and fixed income funds 
assumptions for this business reflect a long term blended expected rate of return of  which includes an long term equity expected rate of return and a fixed income expected rate of return 
the fixed income expected rate of return is a levelized rate  which blends current rates and long term expected returns 
assumptions also reflect a near term mean reversion blended rate of return of 
as of december   all contract groups within our variable life insurance business utilize these rates  as the near term equity rate of return was less than our maximum 
sensitivity for the variable and universal life policies of our individual life segment  a significant portion of our gross profits is derived from mortality margins 
as a result  our estimates of future gross profits are significantly influenced by our mortality assumptions 
our mortality assumptions represent our expected claims experience over the life of these policies and are developed based on company experience or standard industry tables 
unless a material change in mortality experience that we feel is indicative of a long term trend is observed in an interim period  we generally update our mortality assumptions annually in the third quarter 
updates to our mortality assumptions in future periods could have a significant adverse or favorable effect on the results of our operations in the individual life segment 
the dac balance associated with the variable and universal life policies of our individual life segment as of december  was billion 
the following table provides a demonstration of the sensitivity of that dac balance relative to our future mortality assumptions by quantifying the adjustments that would be required  assuming both an increase and decrease in our future mortality rate by

for variable annuity contracts  dac and dsi are more sensitive to changes in our future rate of return assumptions due primarily to the significant portion of our gross profits that is dependent upon the total rate of return on assets held in separate account investment options  and the shorter average life of the contracts 
the dac and dsi balances associated with our domestic variable annuity contracts were billion and billion  respectively  as of december  the following table provides a demonstration of the sensitivity of each of these balances relative to our future rate of return assumptions by quantifying the adjustments to each balance that would be required assuming both an increase and decrease in our future rate of return by basis points 
the sensitivity includes an increase and decrease of basis points to both the near term future rate of return assumptions used over the next four years  and the long term expected rate of return used thereafter

value of business acquired in addition to dac and dsi  we also recognize an asset for value of business acquired  or voba 
voba includes an explicit adjustment to reflect the cost of capital attributable to the acquired insurance contracts  and represents an adjustment to the stated value of inforce insurance contract liabilities to present them at fair value  determined as of the acquisition date 
as of december   voba was  million  and included  million related to the acquisition from aig of the star and edison businesses on february  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the acquisition from aig of the star and edison businesses 
the remaining million relates to previously acquired traditional life  deferred annuity  defined contribution and defined benefit businesses 
voba is amortized over the expected life 
table of contents of the acquired contracts 
for additional information about voba including details on items included in our estimates of future cash flows for the various acquired businesses and its bases for amortization  see note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
voba is also subject to recoverability testing at the end of each reporting period to ensure that the balance does not exceed the present value of anticipated gross profits 
goodwill as of december   our goodwill balance of million is reflected in the following four reporting units million related to our retirement full service business  million related to our asset management business  million related to our gibraltar life and other operations and million related to our international insurance life planner business 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  as of december of each year  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the potential for impairment is more likely than not 
the goodwill impairment analysis is performed at the reporting unit level which is equal to or one level below our operating segments 
this analysis includes a qualitative assessment  for which reporting units may elect to bypass in accordance with accounting guidance  and a quantitative analysis consisting of two steps 
for additional information on goodwill and the process for testing goodwill for impairment  see note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
the international insurance s life planner business and the asset management segment elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and complete their impairment analysis using an earnings multiple approach 
the earnings multiple approach indicates the value of a business based on comparison to publicly traded comparable companies in similar lines of business 
each comparable company is analyzed based on various factors  including  but not limited to  financial risk  size  geographic diversification  profitability  adequate financial data  and an actively traded stock price 
a multiple of price to earnings is developed for the comparable companies using independent analysts consensus estimates for each company s forecasted earnings 
the multiples are then aggregated and a mean and median multiple is calculated for the group 
the lower of the mean or median multiple is then applied to the forecasted earnings of the reporting unit to develop a value 
a control premium is then added to determine a total estimated fair value for the reporting unit 
the retirement full service business and gibraltar life and other operations also elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and complete their impairment analysis using a discounted cash flow approach 
the discounted cash flow approach calculates the value of a business by applying a discount rate reflecting the market expected weighted average rate of return to the projected future cash flows of the reporting unit 
these projected future cash flows were based on our internal forecasts  an expected growth rate and a terminal value 
the weighted average rate of return  or warr  represents the required rate of return on total capitalization 
it is comprised of a required rate of return on equity of a company and the current tax affected cost of debt  which are then weighted by the relative percentages of equity and debt assumed in the capital structure 
to estimate the return on equity  we applied the capital asset pricing model  or capm 
the capm is a generally accepted method for estimating an equity investor s return requirement  and hence a company s cost of equity capital 
capm is determined by beginning with the long term risk free rate of return then applying adjustments that consider the equity risk premium required for large company common stock investments as well as company specific adjustments to address volatility  small company premiums and other risks particular to a specific company 
the warr calculation is applied to a group of companies considered peers of the reporting unit to develop a weighted average rate of return for the peer group which is then used to estimate the market expected weighted average rate of return for the reporting unit 
this process resulted in a discount rate of which was then applied to the expected future cash flows of the retirement full service business and gibraltar life and other operations to estimate its fair value 
after completion of step of the quantitative tests  it was determined that fair values exceeded the carrying amounts for each of the four reporting units and it was concluded there was no impairment as of december  the asset management  international insurance s life planner  gibraltar life and other operations and retirement full service businesses had estimated fair values that exceeded their carrying amounts by    and  respectively 

table of contents estimating the fair value of reporting units is a subjective process that involves the use of significant estimates by management 
the retirement full service business quantitative test is sensitive to a number of key assumptions 
for example  a decline in its forecasted cash flows of  an increase in the discount rate above  or an increase in the equity attributed to support this business representing the carrying value of could result in failing step of the quantitative test and therefore require a step assessment 
regarding all reporting units tested  further market declines or other events impacting the fair value of these businesses  including discount rates  interest rates and growth rate assumptions or increases in the level of equity required to support these businesses  could result in goodwill impairments  resulting in a charge to income 
as of december   the company experienced a market capitalization that was below its consolidated book value 
an analysis was performed in order to confirm the reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values calculated in the goodwill impairment tests discussed above 
the company considered the fact that certain reporting units that do not contain goodwill have lower estimated fair values due to the nature of the risks in their businesses and also considered the negative impact of our corporate other operations on the overall fair value of the company 
the company also considered the amount of control premium necessary to estimate a fair value equal to book value 
when comparing this control premium to actual control premiums experienced in recent insurance company acquisitions  as well as the impact of the lower market environment which can increase industry control premiums  the company concluded that the calculated control premium reflected an amount which we believe is within a range of reasonableness 
based on these factors  the company concluded that the reporting unit fair values calculated in the goodwill impairment test were reasonable 
valuation of investments  including derivatives  and the recognition of other than temporary impairments our investment portfolio consists of public and private fixed maturity securities  commercial mortgage and other loans  equity securities  other invested assets  and derivative financial instruments 
derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest rates  foreign exchange rates  financial indices or the values of securities or commodities 
derivative financial instruments we generally use include swaps  futures  forwards and options and may be exchange traded or contracted in the over the counter market 
we are also party to financial instruments that contain derivative instruments that are embedded in the financial instruments 
management believes the following accounting policies related to investments  including derivatives  are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
each of these policies is discussed further within other relevant disclosures related to the investments and derivatives  as referenced below 
valuation of investments  including derivatives recognition of other than temporary impairments determination of the valuation allowance for losses on commercial mortgage and other loans we present our investments classified as available for sale  including fixed maturity and equity securities  our investments classified as trading  such as our trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities  our derivatives  and our embedded derivatives at fair value in the statements of financial position 
for additional information regarding the key estimates and assumptions surrounding the determination of fair value of fixed maturity and equity securities  as well as derivative instruments  embedded derivatives and other investments  see note to the consolidated financial statements and valuation of assets and liabilities fair value of assets and liabilities 
for our investments classified as available for sale  the impact of changes in fair value is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  or aoci  a separate component of equity 
for our investments classified as trading  the impact of changes in fair value is recorded within asset management fees and other income 
in addition  investments classified as available for sale  as well as those classified as held to maturity  are subject to impairment reviews to identify when a decline in value is other than temporary

for a discussion of our policies regarding the valuation allowance for commercial mortgage and other loans see general account investments commercial mortgage and other loans commercial mortgage and other loan quality 
policyholder liabilities future policy benefit reserves  other than unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses we establish reserves for future policy benefits to  or on behalf of  policyholders in the same period in which the policy is issued  using methodologies prescribed by us gaap 
in applying these methodologies  we are required to make certain reserve assumptions 
for most contracts  we utilize best estimate assumptions as of the date the policy is issued or acquired with provisions for the risk of adverse deviation 
after these reserves are initially established  we perform premium deficiency tests using best estimate assumptions as of the testing date without provisions for adverse deviation 
if reserves determined based on these best estimate assumptions are greater than the net liabilities ie  reserves net of any dac asset  the existing net liabilities are adjusted by first reducing the dac asset by the amount of the deficiency or to zero through a charge to current period earnings 
if the deficiency is more than the dac balance  we then increase the reserve by the excess  again through a charge to current period earnings 
we typically update our actuarial assumptions  such as mortality  morbidity  retirement and policyholder behavior assumptions  annually in the third quarter of each year  unless a material change is observed in an interim period that we feel is indicative of a long term trend 
generally  we do not expect trends to change significantly in the short term and  to the extent these trends may change  we expect such changes to be gradual over the long term 
in a sustained low interest rate environment  there is an increased likelihood that the reserves determined based on best estimate assumptions may be greater than the net liabilities 
the following paragraphs provide additional details about our reserves for our closed block business and financial services businesses 
the future policy benefit reserves for the traditional participating life insurance products of our closed block business  which as of december   represented of our total future policy benefit reserves are determined using the net level premium method 
under this method  the future policy benefit reserves are accrued as a level proportion of the premium paid by the policyholder 
in applying this method  we use mortality assumptions to determine our expected future benefits and expected future premiums  and apply an interest rate to determine the present value of both the expected future benefit payments and the expected future premiums 
the mortality assumptions are based on data from the standard industry mortality tables that were used to determine the cash surrender value of the policies  and the interest rates used are the contractually guaranteed interest rates used to calculate the cash surrender value of the policies 
gains or losses in our results of operations resulting from deviations in actual experience compared to the experience assumed in establishing our reserves for this business are recognized in the determination of our annual dividends to these policyholders 
these gains or losses generally have not created significant volatility in our results of operations since  during most years  the closed block has recognized a cumulative policyholder dividend obligation expense in policyholders dividends  for the excess of actual cumulative earnings over expected cumulative earnings as determined at the time of demutualization 
however  if actual cumulative earnings fall below expected cumulative earnings in future periods  thereby eliminating the cumulative policyholder dividend obligation expense  these gains or losses could result in greater volatility in the closed block business results of operations 
the future policy benefit reserves for our international insurance segment and individual life segment  which as of december   represented of our total future policy benefit reserves combined  relate primarily to non participating whole life and term life products and endowment contracts  and are determined as the present value of expected future benefits to  or on behalf of  policyholders plus the present value of future maintenance expenses less the present value of future net premiums 
the expected future benefits and expenses are determined using assumptions about mortality  lapse  and maintenance expense 
these assumptions are determined by product group 
mortality assumptions are generally based on the company s historical experience or standard industry tables  as applicable  our expense assumptions are based on current levels of maintenance costs  adjusted for the effects of inflation  and our interest rate assumptions are based on current and expected net investment returns 

table of contents the reserves for future policy benefits of our retirement segment  which as of december  represented of our total future policy benefit reserves  primarily relate to our non participating life contingent group annuity and structured settlement products 
these reserves are generally determined as the present value of expected future benefits and expenses based on assumptions about mortality  retirement  maintenance expense  and interest rates 
these assumptions are determined by product group 
our mortality and retirement assumptions are based on company or industry experience  our expense assumptions are based on current levels of maintenance costs  adjusted for the effects of inflation  and our interest rate assumptions are based on current and expected net investment returns 
the reserves for future policy benefits of our corporate other operations  which as of december  represented of our total future policy benefit reserves  primarily relate to our long term care products 
these reserves are generally determined as the present value of expected future benefits and expenses less future premiums  based on assumptions about interest rates  morbidity  mortality  lapses  premium rate increases  and maintenance expenses 
our morbidity and mortality assumptions are based on industry experience  and may include certain adjustments for company experience 
our lapse assumptions are based upon company experience  our expense assumptions are based on current levels of maintenance costs  adjusted for the effects of inflation  and our interest rate assumptions are based on current and expected net investment returns 
our premium rate increase assumptions are based on our projected experience  which considers state regulatory standards for inforce rate increases  as well as our historical experience with filing for such increases 
the remaining of the reserves for future policy benefits as of december  primarily represent reserves for the guaranteed minimum death benefit gmdb and optional living benefit features of the variable annuity products in our individual annuities segment  and group life and disability benefits in our group insurance segment 
the optional living benefits are primarily accounted for as embedded derivatives  with fair values calculated as the present value of future expected benefit payments to customers less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature 
for additional information regarding the valuation of these optional living benefit features  see note to the consolidated financial statements and valuation of assets and liabilities fair value of assets and liabilities variable annuity optional living benefit features 
in establishing reserves for gmdbs and guaranteed minimum income benefits gmib s related to variable annuity contracts  we must make estimates and assumptions about the timing of annuitization  contract lapses and contractholder mortality  as well as interest rates and equity market returns 
assumptions relating to contractholder behavior  such as the timing of annuitization and contract lapses  are based on our experience by contract group  and vary by product type and year of issuance 
we adjust base lapse rate assumptions at the contract level based on a comparison of the actuarially calculated value and the current policyholder account value  as well as other factors  such as the applicability of any surrender charges 
this dynamic lapse rate adjustment reduces the base lapse rate when the guaranteed amount is greater than the account value  as in the money contracts are less likely to lapse 
lapse rates are also generally assumed to be lower for the period where surrender charges apply 
mortality assumptions are generally based on standard industry tables  which we adjust based on our historical experience  and also incorporate a mortality improvement assumption 
these mortality assumptions vary by contract group 
over the last several years  the company s most significant assumption updates that have resulted in changes to our reserves for gmdbs and gmibs have been related to lapse experience and other contractholder behavior assumptions and revisions to expected future rates of returns on investments 
the company expects these assumptions to be the ones most likely to cause significant changes in the future 
changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and can also impact our dac and other balances as discussed above 
for additional information on the calculation of these reserves  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the future rate of return assumptions used in establishing reserves for gmdbs and gmibs related to variable annuity contracts are derived using a reversion to the mean approach  a common industry practice 
for additional information regarding our future expected rate of return assumptions and our reversion to the mean approach see  deferred policy acquisition and other costs 
the following table provides a demonstration of the sensitivity of the reserves for gmdbs and gmibs related to variable annuity contracts relative to our future rate of return assumptions by quantifying the adjustments to these reserves that would be required assuming both a basis point increase and decrease in our future rate of return 
the sensitivity includes an increase and decrease of basis points to both the near term future rate of return assumptions used over the next four years

unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses our liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses of billion as of december  is reported as a component of future policy benefits and relates primarily to the group long term disability products of our group insurance segment 
this liability represents our estimate of future disability claim payments and expenses as well as estimates of claims that we believe have been incurred  but have not yet been reported as of the balance sheet date 
we do not establish loss liabilities until a loss has occurred 
as prescribed by us gaap  our liability is determined as the present value of expected future claim payments and expenses 
expected future claim payments are estimated using assumed mortality and claim termination factors and an assumed interest rate 
the mortality and claim termination factors are based on standard industry tables and the company s historical experience 
our interest rate assumptions are based on factors such as market conditions and expected investment returns 
of these assumptions  our claim termination assumptions have historically had the most significant effect on our level of liability 
we compare our claim termination assumptions to actual terminations annually 
these studies review actual claim termination experience over a number of years with more weight placed on the actual experience in the more recent years 
if actual experience results in a different assumption  we adjust our liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses accordingly with a charge or credit to current period earnings 
in recent years  we have experienced an increase in the volume of new long term disability claims  as well as unfavorable claim termination experience  driven by the economic downturn 
during  our claim termination experience has shown improvement  but has been outpaced by a continued increase in new claims 
we are investing in our claims management process which  over time  should drive improvements in this area 
unearned revenue reserves for universal life and investment contracts our unearned revenue reserve  or urr  reported as a component of policyholders account balances  is billion as of december  this reserve primarily relates to variable and universal life products within our individual life segment and represents policy charges for services to be provided in future periods 
the charges are deferred as unearned revenue and amortized over the expected life of the contract in proportion to the product s estimated gross profits  similar to dac as discussed above 
for the variable and universal life policies of our individual life segment  a significant portion of our gross profits is derived from mortality margins 
as a result  our estimates of future gross profits are significantly influenced by our mortality assumptions 
our mortality assumptions represent our expected claims experience over the life of these policies and are developed based on company experience or standard industry tables 
unless a material change in mortality experience that we feel is indicative of a long term trend is observed in an interim period  we generally update our mortality assumptions annually in the third quarter 
updates to our mortality assumptions in future periods could have a significant adverse or favorable effect on the results of our operations in the individual life segment

pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor pension and other postretirement benefit plans covering employees who meet specific eligibility requirements 
our net periodic costs for these plans consider an assumed discount interest rate  an expected rate of return on plan assets and expected increases in compensation levels and trends in health care costs 
of these assumptions  our expected rate of return assumptions  and to a lesser extent our discount rate assumptions  have historically had the most significant effect on our net period costs associated with these plans 
we determine our expected rate of return on plan assets based upon a building block approach that considers inflation  real return  term premium  credit spreads  equity risk premium and capital appreciation as well as expenses  expected asset manager performance and the effect of rebalancing for the equity  debt and real estate asset mix applied on a weighted average basis to our pension asset portfolio 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for our actual asset allocations by asset category and the asset allocation ranges prescribed by our investment policy guidelines for both our pension and other postretirement benefit plans

given the amount of plan assets as of december   the beginning of the measurement year  if we had assumed an expected rate of return for both our pension and other postretirement benefit plans that was basis points higher or basis points lower than the rates we assumed  the change in our net periodic costs would have been as shown in the table below 
the information provided in the table below considers only changes in our assumed long term rate of return given the level and mix of invested assets at the beginning of the measurement year  without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany any changes in our assumed long term rate of return

for purposes of calculating pension income from our own qualified pension plan for the year ended december   we will decrease the discount rate to from in the expected rate of return on plan assets will decrease to in from in  and the assumed rate of increase in compensation will remain unchanged at in addition to the effect of changes in our assumptions  the net periodic cost or benefit from our pension and other postretirement benefit plans may change due to factors such as actual experience being different from our assumptions  special benefits to terminated employees  or changes in benefits provided under the plans 
at december   the sensitivity of our pension and postretirement obligations to a basis point change in discount rate was as follows december  increase decrease in pension benefits obligation increase decrease in accumulated postretirement benefits obligation increase in discount rate by basis points decrease in discount rate by basis points taxes on income our effective tax rate is based on income  non taxable and non deductible items  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans  planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes 
the company provides for us income taxes on unremitted foreign earnings of its operations in japan and certain operations in india  germany and taiwan 
in addition  beginning in  the company provides for us income taxes on a portion of the current year foreign earnings for its insurance operations in korea 
items required by tax regulations to be included in the tax return may differ from the items reflected in the financial statements 
as a result  the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements may be different than the actual rate applied on the tax return 
some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some differences are temporary  reversing over time  such as valuation of insurance reserves 
temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally 
table of contents represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred  or expenditures for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet been recognized in our financial statements 
the application of us gaap requires us to evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance if necessary to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
considerable judgment is required in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary  and if so  the amount of such valuation allowance 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance we consider many factors  including the nature of the deferred tax assets and liabilities  whether they are ordinary or capital  in which tax jurisdictions they were generated and the timing of their reversal  taxable income in prior carryback years as well as projected taxable earnings exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  the length of time that carryovers can be utilized in the various taxing jurisdictions  any unique tax rules that would impact the utilization of the deferred tax assets  and any tax planning strategies that we would employ to avoid a tax benefit from expiring unused 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances  will be realized 
an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by one percent of income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures  would have resulted in an increase or decrease in our consolidated income from continuing operations before equity in earnings of operating joint ventures in of million 
us gaap prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on tax returns 
the application of this guidance is a two step process  the first step being recognition 
we determine whether it is more likely than not  based on the technical merits  that the tax position will be sustained upon examination 
if a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold  the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements 
the second step is measurement 
we measure the tax position as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
this measurement considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement using the facts  circumstances  and information available at the reporting date 
the company s liability for income taxes includes the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and interest that relate to tax years still subject to review by the internal revenue service irs or other taxing authorities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact in  and of changes to our total unrecognized tax benefits 
we do not anticipate any significant changes within the next months to our total unrecognized tax benefits related to tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired 
the company s affiliates in japan and korea file separate tax returns and are subject to audits by the local taxing authority 
the general statute of limitations for japan and korea are five years from when the return is filed 
reserves for contingencies a contingency is an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty that will ultimately be resolved upon the occurrence of future events 
under us gaap  reserves for contingencies are required to be established when the future event is probable and its impact can be reasonably estimated  such as in connection with an unresolved legal matter 
the initial reserve reflects management s best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised accordingly as facts and circumstances change and  ultimately  when the matter is brought to closure 

table of contents adoption of new accounting pronouncements effective january   the company adopted  retrospectively  new authoritative guidance to address which costs relating to the acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts qualify for deferral 
all prior period financial information has been revised to reflect the retrospective adoption of the amended guidance 
the impact of the retrospective adoption of this guidance on previously reported december  balances was a reduction in deferred policy acquisition costs by billion for the financial services businesses and by billion for the closed block business  an increase in policy reserves for certain limited pay contracts by billion for the financial services businesses  and a reduction in total equity by billion for the financial services businesses and billion for the closed block business 
the impact of the retrospective adoption of this guidance on previously reported income from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended december  and was a decrease of million and million for the financial services businesses  respectively  and an increase of million and million for the closed block business  respectively 
the lower level of costs now qualifying for deferral will be only partially offset by a lower level of amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  and  as such  will initially result in lower earnings in future periods  primarily within the international insurance and individual annuities segments 
the impact to the international insurance segment largely reflects lower deferrals of allocated costs of its proprietary distribution system  while the impact to the individual annuities segment mainly reflects lower deferrals of its wholesaler costs 
while the adoption of this amended guidance changes the timing of when certain costs are reflected in the company s results of operations  it has no effect on the total acquisition costs to be recognized over time and will have no impact on the company s cash flows 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of newly issued accounting pronouncements  including further discussion of the new authoritative guidance addressing which costs relating to the acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts qualify for deferral  as well as our retrospective adoption of a change in method of applying an accounting principle for the company s pension plans

results of operations closed block business for a discussion of the results of operations for the closed block business  see results of operations of closed block business below 
segment measures adjusted operating income 
in managing our business  we analyze operating performance separately for our financial services businesses and our closed block business 
for the financial services businesses  we analyze our segments operating performance using adjusted operating income 
results of the closed block business for all periods are evaluated and presented only in accordance with us gaap 
adjusted operating income does not equate to income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures or net income as determined in accordance with us gaap but is the measure of segment profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources  and consistent with authoritative guidance  is our measure of segment performance 
the adjustments to derive adjusted operating income are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations 
adjusted operating income is not a substitute for income determined in accordance with us gaap  and our definition of adjusted operating income may differ from that used by other companies 
however  we believe that the presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of the financial services businesses 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the presentation of segment results and our definition of adjusted operating income 
annualized new business premiums 
in managing certain of our businesses  we analyze annualized new business premiums  which do not correspond to revenues under us gaap 
annualized new business premiums measure the current sales performance of the business  while revenues primarily reflect the renewal persistency of policies written in prior years and net investment income  in addition to current sales 
annualized new business premiums include of first year premiums or deposits from single pay products 
no other adjustments are made for limited pay contracts 
assets under management 
in managing our asset management business  we analyze assets under management  which do not correspond to us gaap assets  because the principal source of revenues is fees based on assets under management 
assets under management represents the fair market value or account value of assets which we manage directly in proprietary products  such as mutual funds and variable annuities  in separate accounts  wrap fee products and the general account  and assets invested in investment options included in our products that are managed by third party sub managers ie  the non proprietary investment options in the company s products 

table of contents account values 
for our individual annuity and retirement businesses  assets are reported at account value  which do not correspond to us gaap assets 
net sales redemptions in our individual annuity business and net additions withdrawals in our retirement business do not correspond to revenues under us gaap  but are used as a relevant measure of business activity 
results of operations for financial services businesses by segment us retirement solutions and investment management division individual annuities the individual annuities segment offers variable and fixed annuities that provide our customers with tax deferred asset accumulation together with a base death benefit and a suite of optional guaranteed death and living benefits 
as the investment return on the contractholder funds is generally attributed directly to the contractholder  we derive our revenue mainly from fee income generated on variable annuity account values  investment income earned on fixed annuity account values  and certain other management fees 
our expenses primarily consist of interest credited and other benefits to contractholders  amortization of deferred acquisition costs dac and other costs  expenses related to the selling and servicing of the various products we offer  costs of hedging our risk associated with these products and the eventual payment of benefit guarantees and other general business expenses 
these drivers of our business results are generally included in adjusted operating income  with exceptions related to certain guarantees  as discussed below 
the us gaap accounting and our adjusted operating income treatment for our guarantees differs depending upon the specific feature 
the reserves for our guaranteed minimum death benefit gmdb and guaranteed minimum income benefit gmib features are calculated based on our best estimate of actuarial and capital markets return assumptions 
the risks associated with these benefit features are retained and results are included in adjusted operating income 
in contrast  certain of our optional guaranteed living benefit features are accounted for as embedded derivatives and reported at fair value 
under us gaap  the fair values of these benefit features are based on assumptions a market participant would use in pricing these embedded derivative liabilities 
we hedge or limit our exposure to certain risks associated with these features through our living benefits hedging program and product design elements 
adjusted operating income  as discussed below in adjusted operating income and revenues  benefits and expenses excludes amounts related to these changes in the market value of the embedded derivatives and related hedge positions  and the related impact to amortization of dac and other costs 
the items excluded from adjusted operating income are discussed below in variable annuity living benefits hedging program results 
account values account values are a significant driver of our operating results 
since most policy fees are determined by the level of separate account assets  fee income varies according to the level of account values 
additionally  our fee income drives other items such as our pattern of amortization of dac and other costs 
account values are primarily driven by net flows from new business sales  surrenders and withdrawals  and benefit payments  as well as the impact of market changes on account values 
the following tables set forth account value information for the periods indicated 
year ended december  in millions total individual annuities beginning total account value sales surrenders and withdrawals net sales benefit payments net flows change in market value  interest credited and other activity policy charges ending total account value

investments sold through defined contribution plan products are included with such products within the retirement segment 
variable annuity account values were billion  billion and billion as of december   and  respectively 
fixed annuity account values were billion  billion and billion as of december   and  respectively 
as of december   includes variable annuity account values of billion  or  invested in equity portfolios  billion  or  invested in bond portfolios  billion  or  invested in market value adjusted or fixed rate accounts and billion  or  invested in money market funds 
as shown above  our account values are significantly impacted by net sales and the impact of market performance on customers accounts 
our sales levels were relatively flat between and  reflecting the dynamic competitive landscape we have experienced over this period 
during  we suspended additional customer deposits for variable annuities with certain optional living benefit riders that were no longer being offered and implemented variable annuity product modifications for new sales to scale back benefits  increase pricing and close a share class in the third quarter 
certain of our competitors have taken actions to implement product modifications that scale back benefits and to exit  or limit their presence in  the variable annuity marketplace 
our results in future periods may continue to be impacted by the dynamic competitive landscape 
the decrease in surrenders and withdrawals for compared to primarily reflects the continued retention of contracts with guarantees that are in the money and the attractiveness of our inforce contracts relative to substitute products currently available in the marketplace 
the decrease in gross sales for compared to reflects the impacts of modifications we implemented in the first quarter of to scale back benefits and increase pricing  and increased competition as certain of our competitors became more aggressive in product design and pricing 
surrenders and withdrawals were relatively flat despite the increase in account values  reflecting a decline in withdrawal rates 
operating results the following table sets forth the individual annuities segment s operating results for the periods indicated 
year ended december  in millions operating results revenues benefits and expenses adjusted operating income realized investment gains losses  net  and related adjustments related charges income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures adjusted operating income to annual comparison 
adjusted operating income increased million 
excluding the impacts of changes in the estimated profitability of the business  discussed below  adjusted operating income increased million 
this increase was driven by higher asset based fees due to growth in average variable annuity account values  as discussed in account values above  net of an increased level of distribution and amortization costs 
the increase was partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses  net of capitalization  reflecting increased costs to support business initiatives  including a million charge related to an impairment of capitalized software costs in the fourth quarter of  based on a review of recoverability 
the impacts of changes in the estimated profitability of the business include adjustments to the reserves for the gmdb and gmib features of our variable annuity products and to the amortization of dac and other costs 
these adjustments reflect the impacts of market performance  current period experience and the annual review and update of assumptions performed in the third quarter 
these changes resulted in an million net benefit in  and a million net charge in the million net benefit in was primarily driven by the impact of positive market performance on customer accounts relative to our assumptions  partially offset by the 
table of contents impact of annual assumption updates 
these annual assumption updates were driven by updates to our economic assumptions  primarily reflecting reductions to our long term interest and equity rate of return assumptions  as well as updates to actuarial assumptions and other refinements 
the million net charge in was primarily driven by the impact of negative market performance on customer accounts relative to our assumptions 
in addition to these current period impacts  the changes to the estimated profitability of our business also drive changes in our future accrual rates for gmdb and gmib reserves and amortization rates for dac and other costs  which will impact results in future periods 
additionally  we include certain results of our living benefits hedging program in our best estimate of gross profits used to determine amortization rates  which also drives changes in the amortization of dac and other costs in future periods 
the results above exclude the fourth quarter impacts of resetting the amortization rates for this item  as both the results of our living benefits hedging program and related amortization of dac and other costs are excluded from adjusted operating income in the quarter realized  as described below in variable annuity living benefits hedging program results 
however  adjusted operating income in future periods includes the impact on amortization of applying the new rates to actual gross profits 
the inclusion of net unfavorable results from our living benefits hedging program in our best estimate of gross profits drove increases in amortization rates and  therefore  an increase in amortization expense included in adjusted operating income in while a decrease in our best estimate of total gross profits accelerates amortization and decreases income in a given period  it does not affect our cash flow or liquidity position

adjusted operating income decreased million 
excluding the impacts of changes in the estimated profitability of the business on the reserves for the gmdb and gmib features of our variable annuity products and on the amortization of dac and other costs  discussed below  adjusted operating income increased million 
this increase was driven by higher asset based fees due to growth in average variable annuity account values  net of an increased level of distribution costs 
the increase was partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses  net of capitalization  reflecting increased costs to support business growth and higher financing expenses  and the impact of a million benefit in from refinements based on a review and settlement of reinsurance contracts related to acquired business 
the impacts of changes in the estimated profitability of the business resulted in a million net charge in  and a million net benefit in the million net charge in was primarily driven by the impact of negative market performance on customer accounts relative to our assumptions

benefits and expenses  as shown in the table above under operating results  decreased million 
absent the million net decrease related to the impacts of certain changes in our estimated profitability of the business  discussed above  benefits and expenses increased million 
general and administrative expenses  net of capitalization  increased million  driven by higher asset based trail commissions  reflecting account value growth  as well as higher costs to support business initiatives 
the amortization of dac increased million driven by higher gross profits primarily related to the increase in fee income discussed above  and higher amortization rates driven primarily by the inclusion of unfavorable results from our living benefits hedging program in our best estimate of total gross profits used to determine amortization rates

table of contents values 
partially offsetting the increase in revenues was a decrease in net investment income of million  reflecting lower average annuity account values in the general account primarily resulting from net transfers from the general account to the separate accounts  driven by an automatic rebalancing element in some of our optional living benefit features 
benefits and expenses increased million 
absent the million net increase related to the impacts of certain changes in our estimated profitability of the business  discussed above  benefits and expenses increased million 
general and administrative expenses  net of capitalization  increased million  driven by higher distribution and asset management costs  reflecting business and account value growth 
the amortization of dac increased million driven by higher gross profits primarily related to the increase in fee income discussed above 
interest expense also increased million driven by higher borrowings to fund costs related to new business sales 
interest credited to policyholders account balances decreased million primarily due to lower average annuity account values in the general account partially offset by higher amortization of deferred sales inducements reflecting the impact of higher gross profits 
variable annuity risks and risk mitigants the primary risk exposures of our variable annuity contracts relate to actual deviations from  or changes to  the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products  including capital markets assumptions  such as equity market returns  interest rates and market volatility  and actuarial assumptions  such as contractholder longevity mortality  the timing of annuitization and withdrawals  and contract lapses 
for our actuarial assumptions  we have retained the risk that actual experience will differ from the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products 
for our capital markets assumptions  we hedge or limit our exposure to the risk created by capital markets fluctuations through a combination of product design elements  such as an automatic rebalancing element  also referred to as an asset transfer feature  and inclusion of certain optional living benefits in our living benefits hedging program 
our automatic rebalancing element occurs at the contractholder level  and transfers assets between certain variable investments selected by the annuity contractholder and  depending on the benefit feature  the fixed rate account in the general account or a bond portfolio within the separate accounts 
the automatic rebalancing element associated with currently sold products uses a designated bond portfolio within the separate accounts 
the transfers are based on the static mathematical formula used with the particular benefit which considers a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the impact of investment performance on the contractholder s total account value 
the objective of the automatic rebalancing element is to mitigate our exposure to equity market risk and market volatility 
other product design elements we utilize include  among others  asset allocation restrictions and minimum issuance age requirements 
in addition  certain fees are based on a benefit guarantee amount rather than the account value  which helps preserve certain revenue streams when market fluctuations cause account values to decline 
we use our living benefits hedging program to manage the risk associated with certain of our optional living benefit guarantees 
this program represents a balance among three objectives provide severe scenario protection  minimize net income volatility associated with an internally defined hedge target  and maintain capital efficiency 
through our hedge program  we purchase derivatives that seek to replicate the net change in our hedge target  discussed further below 
in addition to mitigating capital markets risk and income statement volatility  the hedging program is also focused on a long term goal of accumulating assets that could be used to pay claims under these benefits irrespective of market path  recognizing that  under the terms of the contracts  we do not expect to begin substantial payment of such claims until many years in the future 
for additional information regarding this program see variable annuities living benefits hedging program results below 
for our optional living benefits features  claims will primarily be paid in the form of lifetime contractholder withdrawal payments 
these payments commence only after the cumulative withdrawals have first exhausted the policy account value 
due to the age of the block  no such claims payments have occurred to date  nor are they expected to occur within the next five years 
the timing and amount of actual future claims depend on actual returns on contractholder account value and actual policyholder behavior relative to our assumptions 
the majority of our variable annuity contracts with optional living benefit features  and all new contracts sold with these features  include an automatic rebalancing element and are also included in our living benefits 
table of contents hedging program 
the guaranteed benefit features of certain legacy products that were sold prior to our implementation of the automatic rebalancing element product feature are included in our living benefits hedge program 
certain legacy guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit gmab products include the automatic rebalancing element  but are not included in the hedging program 
our contracts with the gmib feature have neither risk mitigant  as we have retained the associated risk 
for our gmdbs  we provide a benefit payable in the event of death that  together with the existing contractholder s account balance  is equal to a return of cumulative deposits less any partial withdrawals  or the greater of a minimum return on the contract value or an enhanced value 
we have retained the risk that the total amount of death benefit payable may be greater than the contractholder account value 
however  a substantial portion of the account values associated with gmdbs are subject to an automatic rebalancing element because the contractholder also selected a living benefit feature which includes an automatic rebalancing element 
all of the variable annuity account values with living benefit features also contain gmdbs 
the living and death benefit features for these contracts cover the same insured life  and we have insured both the mortality and longevity risk on these lives

the increase in account values that include both risk mitigants as of december  compared to prior periods primarily reflects sales of our latest product offerings which  include an automatic rebalancing element and are also included in our living benefits hedging program 
variable annuity living benefits hedging program results under us gaap  the liability for certain optional living benefit features is accounted for as an embedded derivative and recorded at fair value  based on assumptions a market participant would use in pricing these features 
the fair value is calculated as the present value of future expected benefit payments to customers less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the applicable living benefit features using option pricing techniques 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the methodology and assumptions used in calculating the fair value under us gaap 
as noted within variable annuity risks and risk mitigants above  we maintain a hedge program to manage the risk associated with these guarantees 
prior to the third quarter of  our hedging strategy sought to generally match certain estimated capital markets sensitivities of the embedded derivative liability as defined by us gaap  excluding the impact of the market s perception of our own non performance risk npr 
since then  our program has utilized an internally defined hedge target that is grounded in a us gaap capital markets valuation framework  with three notable modifications 
the impact of npr is excluded to maximize protection against the entire projected claim irrespective of the possibility of our own default 

table of contents a credit spread is added to the risk free rate of return assumption used under us gaap to estimate future growth of bond investments in the customer separate account funds in order to better replicate the projected returns within those funds 
the equity volatility assumption is adjusted to remove certain risk margins required under us gaap valuation which are used in the projection of customer account values  as we believe the impact of these margins is highly sensitive to short term market conditions and does not reflect the long term nature of these guarantees 
due to these modifications  we expect differences each period between the change in the value of the embedded derivative as defined by us gaap and the change in the value of the hedge positions used to replicate the hedge target  thus potentially increasing volatility in us gaap earnings 
the following table provides a reconciliation between the fair value of the embedded derivative as defined by us gaap and the value of our hedge target as of the periods indicated 
as of december  in billions embedded derivative liability as defined by us gaap less npr adjustment embedded derivative liability as defined by us gaap  excluding npr less portion of embedded derivative liability  excluding npr  excluded from hedge target liability hedge target liability we seek to replicate the changes in our hedge target by entering into a range of exchange traded and over the counter equity and interest rate derivatives to hedge certain capital market risks present in our hedge target

in addition to the hedge assets held as part of the hedging program  we have cash  other invested assets and affiliated receivables available to cover the future claims payable under these guarantees and other liabilities 
for additional information on the liquidity needs associated with our hedging program  see liquidity and capital resources liquidity associated with other activities hedging activities associated with living benefit guarantees 

table of contents while we actively manage our hedge positions  changes in the fair value of these positions may not completely offset changes in the fair value of the hedge target 
additionally  updates to actuarial valuation assumptions  which typically occur annually in the third quarter  are generally not hedged and may result in differences between the hedge positions and the hedge target 
the primary sources of the differences between the changes in the fair value of the hedge positions and the hedge target  other than actuarial valuation assumption updates  fall into one of three categories fund performance in order to project future account value growth  we must make certain assumptions about how each underlying fund will perform 
we map customer funds to indices that we believe are comparable  are readily tradeable and have active derivative markets 
the difference between the modeled fund performance and actual fund performance results in basis differences that can be either positive or negative 
liability basis we experience differences between the actual changes in the hedge target and the expected changes we have modeled and attempt to replicate with the hedge program 
rebalancing costs and volatility there are costs associated with rebalancing hedge positions for basis differences between the hedge positions and the hedge target 
our hedge program is also subject to the impact of realized market volatility in excess of  or lower than  our long term volatility assumptions 
the net impact of both the change in the fair value of the embedded derivative associated with our living benefit features and the change in the fair value of the related hedge positions are included in realized investment gains losses  net  and related adjustments and the related impact to the amortization of dac and other costs is included in related charges  both of which are excluded from adjusted operating income

international insurance division foreign currency exchange rate movements and related hedging strategies as a us based company with significant business operations outside the us  particularly in japan  we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate movements that could impact our us dollar equivalent shareholder return on equity 
we seek to mitigate this impact through various hedging strategies  including the use of derivative contracts and through holding us dollar denominated assets in certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
the operations of our international insurance division are subject to currency fluctuations that can materially affect their us dollar equivalent earnings from period to period  even if earnings on a local currency basis are relatively constant 
we enter into forward currency derivative contracts  and hold dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments  as part of our strategy to effectively fix the currency exchange rates for a portion of our prospective non us dollar denominated earnings streams  thereby reducing earnings volatility from foreign currency exchange rate movements 
the forward currency hedging program is primarily associated with our insurance operations in japan and korea 
in addition  our japanese insurance operations offer a variety of non yen denominated products which are supported by investments in corresponding currencies 
while these non yen denominated assets and liabilities are economically hedged  the accounting for changes in the value of these assets and liabilities due to changes in foreign currency exchange rate movements differs  resulting in volatility in reported us gaap earnings 
for further information on the various hedging strategies used to mitigate the risks of foreign currency exchange rate movements on earnings  see impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on earnings 
we utilize a yen hedging strategy that calibrates the level of hedges to preserve the relative contribution of our yen based business to the company s overall return on equity 
our hedges include a variety of instruments  including us dollar denominated assets held locally by our japanese insurance subsidiaries financed by the combination of us gaap equity and yen denominated liabilities 
we may also hedge using instruments held in our us domiciled entities  such as us dollar denominated debt that has been swapped to yen

table of contents excludes billion and billion as of december  and  respectively  of us dollar assets supporting us dollar liabilities related to us dollar denominated products issued by our japanese insurance operations 
the yen denominated liabilities are reported in corporate and other operations 
the us dollar denominated investments that hedge the us dollar equivalent shareholder return on equity from our japanese insurance operations are recorded on the books of yen based entities and  as a result  foreign currency exchange rate movements will impact their value on the local books of our yen based japanese insurance entities 
we seek to mitigate the risk that future unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements will decrease the value of these us dollar denominated investments on the local books of our yen based japanese insurance entities and therefore negatively impact their equity and regulatory solvency margins by employing internal hedging strategies between a subsidiary of prudential financial and these yen based entities 
these internal hedging strategies have the economic effect of moving the change in value of these us dollar denominated investments due to foreign currency exchange rate movements from our japanese yen based entities to our us dollar based entities 
see liquidity and capital resources liquidity liquidity associated with other activities foreign exchange hedging activities for a discussion of our internal hedging strategies 
these us dollar denominated investments also pay a coupon which is generally higher than what a similar yen denominated investment would pay 
the incremental impact of this higher yield on our us dollar denominated investments  as well as our dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments discussed below  will vary over time  and is dependent on the duration of the underlying investments  as well as interest rate environments in the us and japan at the time of the investments 
see general account investments investment results for a discussion of the investment yields generated by our japanese insurance operations 
impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on earnings forward currency hedging program the financial results of our international insurance segment reflect the impact of an intercompany arrangement with corporate and other operations pursuant to which the segment s non us dollar denominated earnings are translated at fixed currency exchange rates 
the fixed rates are determined in connection with a foreign currency income hedging program designed to mitigate the impact of exchange rate changes on the segment s us dollar equivalent earnings 
pursuant to this program  corporate and other operations execute forward currency contracts with third parties to sell the net exposure of projected earnings for certain currencies in exchange for us dollars at specified exchange rates 
the maturities of these contracts correspond with the future periods typically on a three year rolling basis in which the identified non us dollar denominated earnings are expected to be generated 
in establishing the level of non us dollar denominated earnings that will be hedged through this program  we exclude the anticipated level of us dollar denominated earnings that will be generated by dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments  as well as the anticipated level of non yen denominated earnings that will be generated by non yen denominated products and investments  both of which are discussed in greater detail below 
as a result of this intercompany arrangement  our international insurance segment s results for and reflect the impact of translating yen denominated earnings at fixed currency exchange rates of and yen per us dollar  respectively  and and korean won per us dollar  respectively 
results for will reflect the impact of translating yen and korean won denominated earnings at fixed currency exchange rates of yen per us dollar and korean won per us dollar 

table of contents results of corporate and other operations include any differences between the translation adjustments recorded by the segment at the fixed currency exchange rate versus the actual average rate during the period  and the gains or losses recorded from the forward currency contracts that settled during the period  which include the impact of any over or under hedging of actual earnings that differ from projected earnings

as of december  and  the notional amounts of these forward currency contracts were billion and billion  respectively  of which billion and billion  respectively  were related to our japanese insurance operations 
dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments hedging program in addition  our japanese insurance operations hold dual currency investments in the form of fixed maturities and loans 
the principal of these dual currency investments is yen denominated while the related interest income is us dollar denominated 
these investments are the economic equivalent of exchanging what would otherwise be fixed streams of yen denominated interest income for fixed streams of us dollar denominated interest income 
our japanese insurance operations also hold yen denominated investments that have been coupled with cross currency coupon swap agreements  creating synthetic dual currency investments 
the yen us dollar exchange rate is effectively fixed  as we are obligated in future periods to exchange fixed amounts of yen interest payments generated by the yen denominated investments for fixed amounts of us dollar interest payments at the us dollar exchange rates specified by the cross currency coupon swap agreements 
as of december  and  the notional amount of these investments was billion  or billion  and billion  or billion  respectively  based upon the foreign currency exchange rates applicable at the time these investments were acquired

however  several of our international insurance operations  most notably our japanese operations  also offer products denominated in non local currencies  primarily comprised of us and australian dollar denominated products 
the non yen denominated insurance liabilities related to these products are supported by investments denominated in corresponding currencies  including a significant portion designated as available for sale 
while 
table of contents the impact from foreign currency exchange rate movements on these non yen denominated assets and liabilities is economically matched  the accounting for changes in the value of these assets and liabilities due to changes in foreign currency exchange rate movements differs  resulting in volatility in us gaap earnings 
for example  unrealized gains and losses on available for sale investments  including those arising from foreign currency exchange rate movements  are recorded in aoci  whereas the non yen denominated liabilities are remeasured for foreign currency exchange rate movements  and the related changes in value are recorded in earnings within asset management fees and other income 
investments designated as held to maturity under us gaap are recorded at amortized cost on the balance sheet  but are remeasured for foreign currency exchange rate movements  with the related change in value recorded in earnings within asset management fees and other income 
due to this non economic volatility that is reflected in us gaap earnings  the gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of these non yen denominated liabilities  and certain related non yen denominated assets  are excluded from adjusted operating income and included in realized investment gains losses  net  and related adjustments 
for the years ended december   and  realized investment gains losses  net  and related adjustments includes net losses of  million  net gains of million  and net gains of million  respectively  reflecting the remeasurement of these non yen denominated insurance liabilities  which are presented in the table below  and the remeasurement of certain related non yen denominated assets 
we continue to expect volatility in us gaap earnings resulting from the remeasurement mismatch described above 
for example  based on the december  non yen denominated balances subject to remeasurement including those presented in the table below  if we applied a hypothetical depreciation in value of the yen relative to the us and australian dollar  we estimate this would result in net losses of approximately billion reflected in us gaap earnings 
these net losses would largely be offset by a corresponding increase in unrealized gains in aoci 
conversely  a appreciation in value of the yen relative to these currencies would have an equal but opposite effect 
the table below presents the carrying value of non yen denominated insurance liabilities within our japanese insurance operations as of the periods indicated 
december  in billions us dollar denominated products australian dollar denominated products euro denominated products total excludes billion and billion of insurance liabilities for us dollar denominated products as of december  and  respectively  that are associated with prudential of japan

international insurance operating results the results of our international insurance operations are translated on the basis of weighted average monthly exchange rates  inclusive of the effects of the intercompany arrangement discussed above 
to provide a better understanding of operating performance within the international insurance segment  where indicated below  we have analyzed our results of operations excluding the effect of the year over year change in foreign currency exchange rates 
our results of operations excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations were derived by translating foreign currencies to us dollars at uniform exchange rates for all periods presented  including for constant dollar information discussed below 
the exchange rates used were japanese yen at a rate of yen per us dollar and korean won at a rate of won per us dollar  both of which were determined in connection with the foreign currency income hedging program discussed above 
in addition  for constant dollar information discussed below  activity denominated in us dollars is generally reported based on the amounts as transacted in us dollars 
annualized new business premiums presented on a constant exchange rate basis in the sales results section below reflect translation based on these same uniform exchange rates

year ended december  in millions annualized new business premiums on an actual exchange rate basis life planner operations gibraltar life total on a constant exchange rate basis life planner operations gibraltar life total historically  growth in annualized new business premiums was closely correlated to growth of our life planner and gibraltar life consultant distribution force 
recently  growth in annualized new business premiums is being driven by increased average premium per new policy resulting in part from the growing demand for retirement oriented products  as well as expanded distribution through third party channels  especially banks 
as noted in the table below  bank channel sales contain a disproportionate number of single pay or limited pay contracts which tend to be larger policies and therefore have higher average premiums per policy 
the amount of annualized new business premiums for any given period can be significantly impacted by several factors  including but not limited to  changes in credited interest rates for certain products and other product modifications  changes in tax laws  changes in life insurance regulations or changes in the competitive environment 
sales volume may increase or decrease prior to such changes becoming effective  and then fluctuate in the other direction following such changes

in addition  retained corporate expenses increased in primarily from an increase in corporate advertising  the results of our corporate foreign exchange hedging activities and the costs related to the prepayment of outstanding debt 
these increases are partially offset by a favorable comparative impact for our estimate of payments arising from the use of new social security master death file matching criteria to identify deceased policy and contract holders and the absence of a million expense accrued in related to a voluntary contribution to be made to the insurance industry insolvency fund  related to executive life insurance 
results from corporate and other operations pension income and employee benefits decreased million primarily due to an increase in recorded liabilities for certain employee benefits and higher postretirement costs

greater net charges from other corporate activities  primarily reflecting increased retained corporate expenses  including corporate advertising  contributed to the increased loss 
the increase in net charges from other corporate activities was partially offset by more favorable results from corporate foreign currency hedging activities and reduced charges compared to the prior period for certain retained obligations relating to pre demutualization policyholders to whom we had previously agreed to provide insurance for reduced or no premium in accordance with contractual settlements related to prior individual life insurance sales practices remediation

this hedge program resulted in charges for amortization of derivative costs of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the impact of the market value changes of these derivatives included in realized investment gains losses  net and related adjustments was a loss of million  a gain of million and a loss of million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition to hedging equity market exposure  we may choose to manage the interest rate risk associated with various operations of the financial services businesses by holding capital against a portion of the interest rate exposure rather than fully hedging the risk 
realized investment gains losses  net and related adjustments includes net gains of million  net losses of  million and net gains of million for the years ended december   and respectively  resulting from our decision to utilize this strategy to manage a portion of our interest rate risk 
the  million net loss in was driven by significant declines in risk free interest rates during the year 
the capital consequences associated with our decision to hold capital against a portion of our interest rate exposure have been factored into our capital protection framework 
in addition  we manage certain of the risks associated with our variable annuity products through our living benefit hedging program  which is described under us retirement solutions and investment management division individual annuities 
through our capital protection framework  we maintain access to on balance sheet capital and contingent sources of capital that are available to meet capital needs that may arise related to this hedging program

each year  the board of directors of prudential insurance determines the dividends payable on participating policies for the following year based on the experience of the closed block  including investment income  net realized and unrealized investment gains  mortality experience and other factors 
although closed block experience for dividend action decisions is based upon statutory results  at the time the closed block was established  we developed  as required by us gaap  an actuarial calculation of the timing of the maximum future earnings from the policies included in the closed block 
if actual cumulative earnings in any given period are greater than the cumulative earnings we expected  we will record this excess as a policyholder dividend obligation 
we will subsequently pay this excess to closed block policyholders as an additional dividend unless it is otherwise offset by future closed block performance that is less favorable than we originally expected 
the policyholder dividends we charge to expense within the closed block business will include any change in our policyholder dividend obligation that we recognize for the excess of actual cumulative earnings in any given period over the cumulative earnings we expected in addition to the actual policyholder dividends declared by the board of directors of prudential insurance 
as of december   the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected cumulative earnings was million  which was recorded as a policyholder dividend obligation 
actual cumulative earnings  as required by us gaap  reflect the recognition of realized investment gains and losses in the current period  as well as changes in assets and related liabilities that support the closed block policies 
additionally  the accumulation of net unrealized investment gains that have arisen subsequent to the establishment of the closed block have been reflected as a policyholder dividend obligation of  million at december   to be paid to closed block policyholders unless offset by future experience  with an offsetting amount reported in aoci 
operating results management does not consider adjusted operating income to assess the operating performance of the closed block business

if actual cumulative earnings fall below expected cumulative earnings in future periods  earnings volatility in the closed block business  which is primarily due to changes in investment results  may not be offset by changes in the cumulative policyholder dividend obligation

the increase in the additional us tax is a result of the merger of star and edison businesses into the gibraltar life insurance company  ltd 
it represents the recomputed us tax liability on gibraltar s prior earnings as a result of the repatriation assumption and the merger of the entities 
the local utilization of the deferred tax asset coupled with the repatriation assumption with respect to the applicable earnings of our japanese entities creates the effect of a double tax for us gaap purposes  whereas only one incidence of tax will ever be paid 
in addition  income tax expense includes a million tax benefit from the release of a valuation allowance related to a foreign subsidiary 
excluding the impact of the double tax and the release of the valuation allowance  the income tax expense decreased primarily due to the decrease in pre tax income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures and increase in non taxable investment income for the year ended december  our income tax provision related to foreign operations amounted to an income tax benefit of million in compared to income tax expense of million in our foreign operations income tax provision for and includes million of an additional tax expense and million of an additional tax benefit  respectively  from the re measurement of deferred tax liabilities resulting from the japan corporate income tax rate reduction 
however  since we assume repatriation of earnings from our japanese operations  our domestic tax provision in and includes million of an additional tax benefit and million of an additional tax expense  respectively  resulting from the increase or decrease in the future foreign tax credit benefit and  as a result  the reduction in the japan corporate tax rate had no impact on our overall income tax provision 
excluding the impact from the japan corporate income tax rate reduction  the foreign operations income tax provision decreased primarily due to the decrease in foreign operations pre tax income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures 
we employ various tax strategies  including strategies to minimize the amount of taxes resulting from realized capital gains

experience rated contractholder liabilities  trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and other related investments certain products included in the retirement and international insurance segments are experience rated in that investment results associated with these products are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders 
the majority of investments supporting these experience rated products are classified as trading and are carried at fair value 
these trading investments are reflected on the statements of financial position as trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities  at fair value taasil 
realized and unrealized gains and losses for these investments are reported in asset management fees and other income 
interest and dividend income for these 
table of contents investments is reported in net investment income 
to a lesser extent  these experience rated products are also supported by derivatives and commercial mortgage and other loans 
the derivatives that support these experience rated products are reflected on the statement of financial position as other long term investments and are carried at fair value  and the realized and unrealized gains and losses are reported in realized investment gains losses  net 
the commercial mortgage and other loans that support these experience rated products are carried at unpaid principal  net of unamortized discounts and an allowance for losses  and are reflected on the statements of financial position as commercial mortgage and other loans 
gains and losses on sales and changes in the valuation allowance for commercial mortgage and other loans are reported in realized investment gains losses  net 
our retirement segment has two types of experience rated products that are supported by taasil and other related investments 
fully participating products are those for which the entire return on underlying investments is passed back to the policyholders through a corresponding adjustment to the related liability 
the adjustment to the liability is based on changes in the fair value of all of the related assets  including commercial mortgage and other loans  which are carried at amortized cost  less any valuation allowance 
partially participating products are those for which only a portion of the return on underlying investments is passed back to the policyholders over time through changes to the contractual crediting rates 
the crediting rates are typically reset semiannually  often subject to a minimum crediting rate  and returns are required to be passed back within ten years 
in our international insurance segment  the experience rated products are fully participating 
as a result  the entire return on the underlying investments is passed back to policyholders through a corresponding adjustment to the related liability 
adjusted operating income excludes net investment gains and losses on taasil  related derivatives and commercial mortgage and other loans 
this is consistent with the exclusion of realized investment gains and losses with respect to other investments supporting insurance liabilities managed on a consistent basis 
in addition  to be consistent with the historical treatment of charges related to realized investment gains and losses on investments  adjusted operating income also excludes the change in contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes in the pool of investments including changes in the fair value of commercial mortgage and other loans supporting these experience rated contracts  which are reflected in interest credited to policyholders account balances 
the result of this approach is that adjusted operating income for these products includes net fee revenue and interest spread we earn on these experience rated contracts  and excludes changes in fair value of the pool of investments  both realized and unrealized  that we expect will ultimately accrue to the contractholders 

table of contents the following tables set forth the impact of these items on results that are excluded from adjusted operating income for the periods indicated year ended december  in millions retirement segment investment gains losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities  net derivatives commercial mortgages and other loans change in experience rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes net gains losses international insurance segment investment gains losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities  net change in experience rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes net gains losses total investment gains losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities  net derivatives commercial mortgages and other loans change in experience rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes net gains losses decreases to contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes are limited by certain floors and therefore do not reflect cumulative declines in recorded asset values of million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
we have recovered and expect to recover in future periods these declines in recorded asset values through subsequent increases in recorded asset values or reductions in crediting rates on contractholder liabilities

as prescribed by us gaap  changes in the fair value of commercial mortgage and other loans held for investment in our general account  other than when associated with impairments  are not recognized in income in the current period  while the impact of these changes in fair value are reflected as a change in the liability to fully participating contractholders in the current period 
as shown in the table above  the net impacts for the retirement segment of changes in experience rated contractholder liabilities and investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and other related investments were net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these impacts primarily reflect timing differences between the recognition of the mark to market adjustments and the recognition of the recovery of these adjustments in future periods through subsequent increases in asset values or reductions in crediting rates on contractholder liabilities for partially participating products 
these impacts also reflect the difference between the fair value of the underlying commercial mortgage and other loans and the amortized cost  less any valuation allowance  of these loans  as described above 
valuation of assets and liabilities fair value of assets and liabilities the authoritative guidance related to fair value measurement establishes a framework that includes a three level hierarchy used to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value 
the level in the hierarchy within which the fair value falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement 
the fair values of assets and liabilities classified as level include at least one or more significant unobservable input in the measurement 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for an additional description of the valuation hierarchy levels 

table of contents the tables below present the balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis  as of the periods indicated  split between the financial services businesses and closed block business  and the portion of such assets and liabilities that are classified in level of the valuation hierarchy 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by hierarchy level presented on a consolidated basis

the amount of level liabilities was immaterial to our balance sheet 
all other and other liabilities included within other liabilities and notes of consolidated vies primarily include derivatives 
the amounts classified as level for the financial services businesses exclude the impact of netting 
the determination of fair value  which for certain assets and liabilities is dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions  can have a significant impact on our results of operations and may require the application of a greater degree of judgment depending on market conditions  as the ability to value assets and liabilities can be significantly impacted by a decrease in market activity or a lack of transactions executed in an orderly manner 
the following sections provide information regarding certain assets and liabilities of our financial services businesses and our closed block business which are valued using level inputs and could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
fixed maturity and equity securities fixed maturity securities included in level in our fair value hierarchy are generally priced based on internally developed valuations or indicative broker quotes 
for certain private fixed maturity and equity securities  the internally developed valuation model uses significant unobservable inputs and  accordingly  such securities are included in level in our fair value hierarchy 
level fixed maturity securities included approximately billion as of december  and billion as of december  of public fixed maturities  with values primarily based on indicative broker quotes  and approximately billion as of december  and billion as of december  of private fixed maturities  with values primarily based on internally developed models 
significant unobservable inputs used included issue specific credit 
table of contents adjustments  material non public financial information  management judgment  estimation of future earnings and cash flows  default rate assumptions  liquidity assumptions and indicative quotes from market makers 
these inputs are usually considered unobservable  as not all market participants will have access to this data 
the impact our determination of fair value for fixed maturity and equity securities has on our results of operations is dependent on our classification of the security as either trading  available for sale  or held to maturity 
for our investments classified as trading  the impact of changes in fair value is recorded within asset management fees and other income 
for our investments classified as available for sale  the impact of changes in fair value is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss in aoci  a separate component of equity 
our investments classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost 
other long term investments other long term investments classified in level primarily include real estate held in consolidated investment funds and fund investments where the fair value option has been elected 
the fair value of real estate held in consolidated investment funds is determined through an independent appraisal process 
the appraisals generally utilize a discounted cash flow model 
the appraisals also include replacement cost estimates and recent sales data as alternate methods of fair value 
these appraisals and the related assumptions are updated at least annually 
since many of the assumptions utilized are unobservable and are considered to be significant inputs to the valuation  the real estate investments within other long term investments are reflected within level consolidated real estate investment funds classified as level totaled approximately billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
the fair value of fund investments  where the fair value option has been elected  is primarily determined by the fund managers 
since the valuations may be based on unobservable market inputs and cannot be validated by the company  these investments are included within level investments in these funds included in level totaled approximately billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
derivative instruments derivatives classified as level  excluding embedded derivatives which are discussed in variable annuity optional living benefit features below  include look back equity options and other structured products 
these derivatives are recorded at fair value either as assets  within other trading account assets  or other long term investments  or as liabilities  within other liabilities  and are valued based upon models with some significant unobservable market inputs or inputs from less actively traded markets 
we validate these values through periodic comparison of our fair values to broker dealer values 
the fair values of otc derivative assets and liabilities classified as level totaled approximately million and million  respectively  as of december  and million and million  respectively  as of december   without giving consideration to the impact of netting 
all realized and unrealized changes in fair value of these derivatives  with the exception of the effective portion of qualifying cash flow hedges and hedges of net investments in foreign operations  are recorded in current earnings 
generally  the changes in fair value of these derivatives  excluding those that qualify for hedge accounting  are recorded in realized investment gains losses  net 
for additional information regarding the impact of changes in fair value of derivative instruments on our results of operations see realized investment gains and losses below 
separate account assets separate account assets included in level primarily include real estate investments for which values are determined as described above under other long term investments 
separate account liabilities are reported at contract value and not fair value 
variable annuity optional living benefit features future policy benefits classified in level primarily include liabilities related to guarantees associated with the optional living benefit features of certain variable annuity contracts offered by our individual annuities 
table of contents segment  including guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits gmab  guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits gmwb and guaranteed minimum income and withdrawal benefits gmiwb 
these benefits are accounted for as embedded derivatives and carried at fair value with changes in fair value included in realized investment gains losses  net 
the fair values of the gmab  gmwb and gmiwb liabilities are calculated as the present value of future expected benefit payments to customers less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature 
this methodology could result in either a liability or contra liability balance  given changing capital market conditions and various policyholder behavior assumptions 
since there is no observable active market for the transfer of these obligations  the valuations are calculated using internally developed models with option pricing techniques 
these models utilize significant assumptions that are primarily unobservable  including assumptions as to lapse rates  npr  utilization rates  withdrawal rates  mortality rates and equity market volatility 
future policy benefits classified as level were net liabilities of billion and billion as of december  and  respectively

realized investment gains and losses realized investment gains and losses are generated from numerous sources  including the following significant items sale of investments adjustments to the cost basis of investments for other than temporary impairments recognition of other than temporary impairments in earnings for foreign denominated securities that are approaching maturity and are in an unrealized loss position due to foreign currency exchange rate movements prepayment premiums received on private fixed maturity securities net changes in the allowance for losses  certain restructurings and foreclosures on commercial mortgage and other loans fair value changes on commercial mortgage loans carried at fair value fair value changes on embedded derivatives and free standing derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment except those derivatives used in our capacity as a broker or dealer 
the level of other than temporary impairments generally reflects economic conditions and is expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and to decrease when economic conditions improve 
historically  the causes of other than temporary impairments have been specific to each individual issuer and have not directly resulted in impairments to other securities within the same industry or geographic region 
we may also realize additional credit and interest rate related losses through sales of investments pursuant to our credit risk and portfolio management objectives 
for a discussion of our policies regarding other than temporary impairments see general account investments fixed maturity securities other than temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities and general account investments equity securities other than temporary impairments of equity securities below 
we use interest rate and currency swaps and other derivatives to manage interest and currency exchange rate exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities  including duration mismatches 
we use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk that unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates will materially affect us dollar equivalent earnings generated by certain of our non us businesses 
we also use equity based and interest rate derivatives to hedge a portion of the risks embedded in some of our annuity products 
derivative contracts also include forward purchases and sales of to be announced mortgage backed securities primarily related to our dollar roll program 
many of these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting  and consequently  we recognize the changes in fair value of such contracts from period to period in current earnings  
table of contents although we do not necessarily account for the related assets or liabilities the same way 
accordingly  realized investment gains and losses from our derivative activities can contribute significantly to fluctuations in net income

adjusted operating income generally excludes realized investment gains losses  net  subject to certain exceptions 
these exceptions primarily include realized investment gains or losses within certain of our businesses for which such gains or losses are a principal source of earnings  gains or losses associated with terminating hedges of foreign currency earnings and current period yield adjustments  and related charges and adjustments

represents circumstances where we believe credit events or other adverse conditions of the respective issuers have caused  or will lead to  a deficiency in the contractual cash flows related to the investment 
the amount of the impairment recorded in earnings is the difference between the amortized cost of the debt security and the net present value of its projected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate implicit in the debt security prior to impairment 
primarily represents circumstances where securities with losses from foreign currency exchange rate movements approach maturity 
during  we recorded other than temporary impairments of million in earnings related to securities with unrealized losses from foreign currency exchange rate movements that are approaching maturity 
fixed maturity other than temporary impairments in were concentrated in the consumer non cyclical  technology  and utility sectors of our corporate securities  and to a lesser extent within asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages 
these other than temporary impairments were primarily related to securities with unrealized losses from foreign currency exchange rate movements that are approaching maturity or related to securities with liquidity concerns  downgrades in credit  bankruptcy or other adverse financial conditions of the respective issuers  which have caused  or we believe will lead to  a deficiency in the contractual cash flows related to the investment 
our japanese insurance operations hold non yen denominated investments which in some cases  due primarily to the strengthening of the yen against the us dollar  as of year end are in an unrealized loss position 
as the securities approach maturity and remain in an unrealized loss position  it becomes less likely that the exchange rates will recover and more likely that losses will be realized upon maturity 
accordingly  additional impairments will be recorded in earnings as they approach maturity 
as of december   gross unrealized losses related to those securities maturing between january  and december  are million 
absent a change in currency rates  impairments of approximately million would be recorded in earnings in and approximately million in on these securities 
fixed maturity other than temporary impairments in were concentrated in the utility  finance  and consumer non cyclical sectors of our corporate securities  asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages  and japanese commercial mortgage backed securities 
these other than temporary impairments were primarily related to securities with unrealized foreign currency translation losses that are approaching maturity or related to securities with liquidity concerns  downgrades in credit  bankruptcy or other adverse financial conditions of the respective issuers  which have caused  or we believe will lead to  a deficiency in the contractual cash flows related to the investment

general account investments we maintain diversified investment portfolios in our general account to support our liabilities to customers in our financial services businesses and the closed block business  as well as our other general liabilities 
our general account does not include assets of our trading and banking operations  assets of our asset management operations  including assets managed for third parties  and those assets classified as separate account assets on our balance sheet 
the general account portfolios are managed pursuant to the distinct objectives and investment policy statements of the financial services businesses and the closed block business 
the primary investment objectives of the financial services businesses include hedging the market risk characteristics of the major product liabilities and other obligations of the company  optimizing investment income yield within risk constraints over time  and for certain portfolios  optimizing total return  including both investment income yield and capital appreciation  within risk constraints over time  while managing the market risk exposures associated with the corresponding product liabilities 
we pursue our objective to optimize investment income yield for the financial services businesses over time through the investment of net operating cash flow  including new product premium inflows  and proceeds from investment sales  repayments and prepayments  into investments with attractive risk adjusted yields  and where appropriate  the sale of lower yielding investments  either to meet various cash flow needs or to manage the portfolio s risk exposure profile with respect to duration  credit  currency and other risk factors  while considering the impact on taxes and capital 
the primary investment objectives of the closed block business include providing for the reasonable dividend expectations of the participating policyholders within the closed block business and the class b shareholders  and optimizing total return  including both investment income yield and capital appreciation  within risk constraints  while managing the market risk exposures associated with the major products in the closed block business 
our portfolio management approach  while emphasizing our investment income yield and asset liability risk management objectives  also takes into account the capital and tax implications of portfolio activity  our assertions regarding our ability and intent to hold equity securities to recovery  and our lack of any intention or requirement to sell debt securities before anticipated recovery

table of contents management of investments the investment committee of our board of directors oversees our proprietary investments  including our general account portfolios 
it also regularly reviews performance and risk positions 
our chief investment officer organization cio organization works with our risk management group to develop the investment policies for the general account portfolios of our domestic and international insurance subsidiaries  and directs and oversees management of the general account portfolios within risk limits and exposure ranges approved annually by the investment committee 
the cio organization  including related functions within our insurance subsidiaries  works closely with product actuaries and risk management to understand the characteristics of our products and their associated market risk exposures 
this information is incorporated into the development of target asset portfolios that hedge market risk exposures associated with the liability characteristics and establish investment risk exposures  within tolerances proscribed by prudential s investment risk limits  on which we expect to earn an attractive risk adjusted return 
we develop asset strategies for specific classes of product liabilities and attributed or accumulated surplus  each with distinct risk characteristics 
market risk exposures associated with the liabilities include interest rate risk which is addressed through the duration characteristics of the target asset mix  and currency risk which is addressed by the currency profile of the target asset mix 
in certain of our smaller markets  outside of the us and japan  capital markets limitations hinder our ability to hedge interest rate exposure to the same extent we do for our us and japan businesses and lead us to accept a higher degree of interest rate risk in these smaller portfolios 
general account portfolios typically include allocations to credit and other investment risks as a means to enhance investment yields and returns over time 
most of our products can be categorized into the following three classes interest crediting products for which the rates credited to customers are periodically adjusted to reflect market and competitive forces and actual investment experience  such as fixed annuities and universal life insurance  participating individual and experience rated group products in which customers participate in actual investment and business results through annual dividends  interest or return of premium  and guaranteed products for which there are price or rate guarantees for the life of the contract  such as traditional whole life and endowment products  guaranteed investment contracts and funding agreements 
our total investment portfolio is composed of a number of operating portfolios 
each operating portfolio backs a specific set of liabilities and the portfolios have a target asset mix that supports the liability characteristics  including duration  cash flow  liquidity needs and other criteria 
as of december   the average duration of our general account investment portfolios attributable to the domestic financial services businesses  including the impact of derivatives  is between and years 
as of december   the average duration of our general account portfolios attributable to our japanese insurance operations  including the impact of derivatives  is approximately years  which represents a blend of yen denominated and us and australian dollar denominated investments  which have distinct average durations 
our asset liability management process has enabled us to successfully manage our portfolios through several market cycles 
we implement our portfolio strategies primarily through investment in a broad range of fixed income assets  including government and agency securities  public and private corporate bonds and structured securities  and commercial mortgage loans 
in addition  we hold small allocations to alternative assets and other equities 
we manage our public fixed maturity portfolio to a risk profile directed or overseen by the cio organization and risk management groups and to a profile that also reflects the local market environments impacting both our domestic and international insurance portfolios 
the return that we earn on the portfolio will be reflected both as investment income and also as realized gains or losses on investments 
we use privately placed corporate debt securities and commercial mortgage loans  which consist of well underwritten mortgages on diversified properties in terms of geography  property type and borrowers  to enhance the yield on our portfolio and to improve the overall diversification of the portfolios 
private placements typically offer enhanced yields due to an illiquidity premium and generally offer enhanced credit protection in the form of covenants 
our origination capability offers the opportunity to lead transactions and gives us the opportunity for better terms  including covenants and call protection  and to take advantage of innovative deal structures 

table of contents derivative strategies are employed in the context of our risk management framework to enhance our ability to manage interest rate and currency risk exposures of the asset portfolio relative to the liabilities and to manage credit and equity positions in the investment portfolios 
for a discussion of our risk management process see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below 
our portfolio asset allocation reflects our emphasis on diversification across asset classes  sectors  and issuers 
the cio organization  directly and through related functions within the insurance subsidiaries  implements portfolio strategies primarily through various asset management units within prudential s asset management segment 
activities of the asset management segment on behalf of the general account portfolios are directed and overseen by the cio organization and monitored by risk management for compliance with investment risk limits 
portfolio composition our investment portfolio consists of public and private fixed maturity securities  commercial mortgage and other loans  equity securities and other invested assets 
the composition of our general account reflects  within the discipline provided by our risk management approach  our need for competitive results and the selection of diverse investment alternatives available primarily through our asset management segment 
the size of our portfolio enables us to invest in asset classes that may be unavailable to the typical investor 
in the fourth quarter of  our retirement segment completed two significant pension risk transfer transactions  in which we issued non participating group annuity contracts to two unaffiliated pension plan sponsors  and assumed responsibility for certain pension benefit obligations for participants covered by the agreements 
in return for assuming these obligations  we received approximately billion of in kind assets  consisting of approximately billion of fixed maturity securities and approximately billion of private equity partnership assets

asset backed securities included within asset backed securities attributable to both the financial services businesses and the closed block business are securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages 
while there is no market standard definition  we define sub prime mortgages as residential mortgages that are originated to weaker quality obligors as indicated by weaker credit scores  as well as mortgages with higher loan to value ratios or limited documentation 
the deterioration of the us housing market and higher unemployment levels over the past several years  coupled with relaxed underwriting standards for some originators of sub prime mortgages through  have led to higher delinquency rates  particularly for those mortgages issued in and this has resulted in increased attention given to potential deficiencies in lenders foreclosure documentation  causing delays in the foreclosure process 
from the perspective of an investor in securities backed by sub prime collateral  significant delays in foreclosure proceedings have resulted in increased servicing costs which negatively affect the value of the impacted securities 
separately  as an investor in sub prime securities  we are pursuing legal and other actions with respect to potential remedies arising from any potential deficiencies related to the original lending and securitization practices

commercial mortgage backed securities the commercial real estate market was severely impacted by the financial crisis and the subsequent recession  however  market fundamentals appear to have bottomed and have shown signs of improvement since late commercial real estate vacancy rates have declined from their peak  rent growth has turned positive  and prices of commercial real estate have stabilized 
additionally  the elevated delinquency rate on mortgages in the commercial mortgage backed securities market has slowed and refinancing activity has increased  reflecting the improvement in these fundamentals 
the loans included in new issues seem to reflect better underwriting and lower levels of leverage compared to although there are positive signs in commercial real estate  there are still some significant challenges for this market  including numerous future loan workouts  a large wave of refinancings for over leveraged properties and numerous legislative changes

credit derivative exposure to public fixed maturities in addition to the credit exposure from public fixed maturities noted above  we sell credit derivatives to enhance the return on our investment portfolio by creating credit exposure similar to an investment in public fixed maturity cash instruments 
in a credit derivative  we sell credit protection on an identified name or a broad based index  and in return receive a quarterly premium 
this premium or credit spread generally corresponds to the difference between the yield on the referenced name s or an index s underlying reference names public fixed maturity cash instruments and swap rates at the time the agreement is executed 
the majority of the underlying reference names in single name and index credit derivatives where we have sold credit protection  as well as all the counterparties to these agreements  are investment grade credit quality and our credit derivatives have a remaining term to maturity of five years or less 
credit derivative contracts are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value  including the premium received  recorded in realized investment gains losses  net

other than temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities we maintain separate monitoring processes for public and private fixed maturities and create watch lists to highlight securities that require special scrutiny and management 
our public fixed maturity asset managers formally review all public fixed maturity holdings on a quarterly basis and more frequently when necessary to identify potential credit deterioration whether due to ratings downgrades  unexpected price variances  and or company or industry specific concerns 
for private placements  our credit and portfolio management processes help ensure prudent controls over valuation and management 
we have separate pricing and authorization processes to establish checks and balances for new investments 
we apply consistent standards of credit analysis and due diligence for all transactions  whether they originate through our own in house origination staff or through agents 
our regional offices closely monitor the portfolios in their regions 
we set all valuation standards centrally  and we assess the fair value of all investments quarterly 
our private fixed maturity asset managers formally review all private fixed maturity holdings on a quarterly basis and more frequently when necessary to identify potential credit deterioration whether due to ratings downgrades  unexpected price variances  and or company or industry specific concerns 
fixed maturity securities classified as held to maturity are those securities where we have the intent and ability to hold the securities until maturity 
these securities are reflected at amortized cost in our consolidated statements of financial position 
other fixed maturity securities are considered available for sale and  as a result  we record unrealized gains and losses to the extent that amortized cost is different from estimated fair value 
all held to maturity securities and all available for sale securities with unrealized losses are subject to our review to identify other than temporary impairments in value 
in evaluating whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we consistently consider several factors including  but not limited to  the following the reasons for the decline in value credit event  currency or interest rate related  including general credit spread widening  the financial condition of and near term prospects of the issuer  and the extent and duration of the decline 

table of contents in determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we place greater emphasis on our analysis of the underlying credit versus the extent and duration of a decline in value 
our credit analysis of an investment includes determining whether the issuer is current on its contractual payments  evaluating whether it is probable that we will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the security  and analyzing our overall ability to recover the amortized cost of the investment 
we continue to utilize valuation declines as a potential indicator of credit deterioration  and apply additional levels of scrutiny in our analysis as the severity and duration of the decline increases 
in addition  we recognize an other than temporary impairment in earnings for a debt security in an unrealized loss position when a we have the intent to sell the debt security  or b it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery or c a foreign currency denominated security with a foreign currency translation loss approaches maturity 
for all debt securities in unrealized loss positions that do not meet any of these criteria  we analyze our ability to recover the amortized cost by comparing the net present value of our best estimate of projected future cash flows with the amortized cost of the security 
if the net present value is less than the amortized cost of the investment  an other than temporary impairment is recorded 
the determination of the assumptions used in these projections requires the use of significant management judgment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these assumptions and our policies for recognizing other than temporary impairments for debt securities

we originate commercial and agricultural mortgage loans using a dedicated investment staff and a network of independent companies through our various regional offices 
all loans are underwritten consistently to our standards using a proprietary quality rating system that has been developed from our experience in real estate and mortgage lending 
uncollateralized loans primarily represent reverse dual currency loans and corporate loans which do not meet the definition of a security under authoritative accounting guidance

composition of commercial and agricultural mortgage loans the commercial real estate market was severely impacted by the financial crisis and the subsequent recession  though the flow of capital to commercial real estate has been strong since portfolio lenders have been actively originating loans  focusing primarily on the highest quality properties in major markets  resulting in an increase in the liquidity and availability of capital in the commercial mortgage loan market 
for most property types  the market fundamentals have stabilized or are improving 
in addition  the commercial banks are active and there has been increased loan origination activity by securitization lenders as market spreads have tightened 
these conditions have led to greater competition for portfolio lenders such as our general account  though underwriting remains conservative 
while there is still some weakness in commercial real estate fundamentals that are dependent on employment recovery  delinquency rates on our commercial mortgage loans remain stable

the loan to value ratio compares the amount of the loan to the fair value of the underlying property collateralizing the loan  and is commonly expressed as a percentage 
loan to value ratios greater than indicate that the loan amount is greater than the collateral value 
a smaller loan to value ratio indicates a greater excess of collateral value over the loan amount 
the debt service coverage ratio compares a property s net operating income to its debt service payments 
debt service coverage ratios less than times indicate that property operations do not generate enough income to cover the loan s current debt payments 
a larger debt service coverage ratio indicates a greater excess of net operating income over the debt service payments

the values utilized in calculating these loan to value ratios are developed as part of our periodic review of the commercial and agricultural mortgage loan portfolio  which includes an internal evaluation of the underlying collateral value

we place loans on early warning status in cases where  based on our analysis of the loan s collateral  the financial situation of the borrower or tenants or other market factors  we believe a loss of principal or interest could occur 
we classify loans as closely monitored when we determine there is a collateral deficiency or other credit events that may lead to a potential loss of principal or interest 
loans not in good standing are those loans where we have concluded that there is a high probability of loss of principal  such as when the loan is in the process of foreclosure or the borrower is in bankruptcy 
in our domestic operations  our workout and special servicing professionals manage the loans on the watch list 
as described below  in determining our allowance for losses we evaluate each loan on the watch list to determine if it is probable that amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected 
in our international portfolios  we monitor delinquency in consumer loans on a pool basis and evaluate any servicing relationship and guarantees the same way we do for commercial mortgage loans 
we establish an allowance for losses to provide for the risk of credit losses inherent in the lending process 
the allowance includes loan specific reserves for loans that are determined to be impaired as a result of our loan review process  and a portfolio reserve for probable incurred but not specifically identified losses for loans which are not on the watch list 
we define an impaired loan as a loan for which we estimate it is probable that amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected 
the loan specific portion of the loss allowance is based on our assessment as to ultimate collectability of loan principal and interest 
valuation allowances for an impaired loan are recorded based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or based on the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the portfolio reserve for incurred but not specifically identified losses considers the current credit composition of the portfolio based on the internal quality ratings mentioned above 
the portfolio reserves are determined using past loan experience  including historical credit migration  loss probability  and loss severity factors by property type 
these factors are reviewed and updated as appropriate 
the valuation allowance for commercial mortgage and other loans can increase or decrease from period to period based on these factors

all securities with unrealized losses are subject to our review to identify other than temporary impairments in value 
in evaluating whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we consistently consider several factors including  but not limited to  the following the extent and the duration of the decline  including  but not limited to  the following general guidelines declines in value greater than  maintained for six months or greater  declines in value maintained for one year or greater  and declines in value greater than  the reasons for the decline in value issuer specific event  currency or market fluctuation  our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value  including certain equity securities managed by independent third parties where we do not exercise management discretion concerning individual buy or sell decisions  and the financial condition of and near term prospects of the issuer 
we generally recognize other than temporary impairments for securities with declines in value greater than maintained for six months or greater or with any decline in value maintained for one year or greater 
in addition  in making our determinations we continue to analyze the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  including an assessment of the issuer s capital position  and consider our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value 
for those securities that have declines in value that are deemed to be only temporary  we make an assertion as to our ability and intent to retain the security until recovery 
once identified  these securities are restricted from trading unless authorized based upon events that could not have been foreseen at the time we asserted our ability and intent to retain the security until recovery 
examples of such events include  but are not limited to  the deterioration of the issuer s creditworthiness  a major business combination or disposition  a change in regulatory requirements  certain other portfolio actions or other similar events 
for those securities that have declines in value for which we cannot assert our ability and intent to retain until recovery  including certain equity securities managed by independent third parties where we do not exercise management discretion concerning individual buy or sell decisions  impairments are recognized as other than temporary regardless of the reason for  or the extent of  the decline 
for perpetual preferred securities  which have characteristics of both debt and equity securities  we apply an impairment model similar to our fixed maturity securities  factoring in the position of the security in the capital structure and the lack of a formal maturity date

liquidity and capital resources overview liquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet the payment obligations of the company 
capital refers to the long term financial resources available to support the operations of our businesses  fund business growth  and provide a cushion to withstand adverse circumstances 
our ability to generate and maintain sufficient liquidity and capital depends on the profitability of our businesses  general economic conditions and our access to the capital markets and the alternate sources of liquidity and capital described herein 
effective and prudent liquidity and capital management is a priority across the organization 
management monitors the liquidity of prudential financial and its subsidiaries on a daily basis and projects borrowing and capital needs over a multi year time horizon through our quarterly planning process 
we believe that cash flows from the sources of funds available to us are sufficient to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of prudential financial and its subsidiaries  including under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios 
we have a capital management framework in place that facilitates the allocation of capital and approval of capital uses  and we forecast capital sources and uses on a quarterly basis 
furthermore  we employ a capital protection framework 
table of contents to ensure the availability of sufficient capital resources to maintain adequate capitalization on a consolidated basis and competitive risk based capital ratios and solvency margins for our insurance subsidiaries under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios 
the dodd frank act may result in the imposition on us of new capital and liquidity standards  including requirements regarding risk based capital  leverage  liquidity  stress testing and other matters 
we are currently under consideration by the financial stability oversight council for a proposed determination that we should be subject to these and other regulatory standards and to supervision by the board of governors of the federal reserve system under the dodd frank act 
see business regulation and risk factors for information regarding the potential impact of the dodd frank act 
during  we took the following significant actions that impacted our liquidity and capital position we repositioned our capital structure by issuing an aggregate of billion of junior subordinated debt in public offerings  in addition to maturing debt  we repaid billion of senior debt through optional redemptions of retail notes  we repurchased million of shares of our common stock and paid shareholder dividends of million  and we made substantial investments in our businesses  including the expansion of our retirement business through two significant pension risk transfer transactions and an agreement to acquire the hartford s individual life insurance business  which closed in january capital our capital management framework is primarily based on statutory risk based capital and solvency margin measures 
due to our diverse mix of businesses and applicable regulatory requirements  we apply certain refinements to the framework that are designed to more appropriately reflect risks associated with our businesses on a consistent basis across the company 
in addition  we use an economic capital framework to inform capital decisions 
we seek to capitalize all of our subsidiaries and businesses in accordance with their ratings targets  and we believe prudential financial s capitalization and use of financial leverage are consistent with those ratings targets 
our long term senior debt rating targets for prudential financial are a for standard poor s rating services  or s p  moody s investors service  inc  or moody s  and fitch ratings ltd  or fitch  and a for am best company  or am best 
our financial strength rating targets for our life insurance companies are aa aa aa for s p  moody s and fitch  respectively  and a for am best 
currently  some of our ratings are below these targets 
for a description of the potential impacts of ratings downgrades  see ratings 
capital governance our capital management framework is ultimately reviewed and approved by the company s board of directors 
prior to board review  our capital and financial controls committee cfcc reviews the use and allocation of capital above certain threshold amounts to ensure that capital is efficiently deployed and earns returns consistent with our strategic objectives  ratings aspirations and other goals and targets 
this management committee provides a multi disciplinary due diligence review of specific initiatives or transactions requiring the use of capital  including all mergers and acquisitions  as well as new products  initiatives and transactions that present substantial reputational  legal  regulatory  operating  accounting or tax risk 
the cfcc also evaluates the company s annual capital and financing plan and quarterly updates to this plan and the company s capital  liquidity and financial position  borrowing plans  and related matters prior to the discussion of these items with the company s board of directors 
under our capital management policy approved by the board of directors  our chairman and chief executive officer and vice chairman are authorized to approve capital actions on behalf of the company and to further delegate authority with respect to capital actions to appropriate officers 
any capital commitment that exceeds the authority granted to senior management is separately authorized by the board 

table of contents capitalization the primary components of capitalization for the financial services businesses consist of the equity we attribute to the financial services businesses and outstanding capital debt  including junior subordinated debt  of the financial services businesses 
as shown in the table below  as of december   the financial services businesses had billion in capital  all of which was available to support the aggregate capital requirements of its three divisions and its corporate and other operations 
based on our assessment of these businesses and operations  we believe this level of capital is consistent with our ratings targets 
december  in millions attributed equity junior subordinated debt ie hybrid securities other capital debt total capital excludes aoci

regulatory capital we manage prudential insurance  gibraltar  prudential of japan  and our other domestic and international insurance subsidiaries to regulatory capital levels consistent with our aa ratings targets 
the risk based capital  or rbc  ratio is a primary measure of the capital adequacy of prudential insurance  which includes businesses in both the financial services businesses and the closed block business  and our other domestic insurance subsidiaries 
rbc is calculated based on statutory financial statements and risk formulas consistent with national association of insurance commissioners  or naic  practices 
rbc considers  among other things  risks related to the type and quality of the invested assets  insurance related risks associated with an insurer s products and liabilities  interest rate risks and general business risks 
the rbc ratio calculations are intended to assist insurance regulators in measuring the insurer s solvency and ability to pay future claims 
the reporting of rbc measures is not intended for the purpose of ranking any insurance company or for use in connection with any marketing  advertising or promotional activities but is available to the public 
all of our domestic insurance companies have rbc ratios that exceed the minimum level required by applicable insurance regulations 
the table below presents the rbc ratios of certain of our domestic insurance subsidiaries as of the periods indicated december  prudential insurance prudential annuities and life assurance corporation similar to the rbc ratios that are employed by us insurance regulators  regulatory authorities in the international jurisdictions in which we operate generally establish some form of minimum solvency margin requirements for insurance companies based on local statutory accounting practices 
these solvency margins are a primary measure of the capital adequacy of our international insurance operations 
maintenance of our solvency margins at certain levels is also important to our competitive positioning  as in certain jurisdictions  such as japan  these solvency margins are required to be disclosed to the public and therefore impact the public perception of an insurer s financial strength 
the table below presents the solvency margins of our most significant international insurance subsidiaries as of the periods indicated december  march  prudential of japan gibraltar life consolidated reflects the merger of the acquired star and edison entities with gibraltar  which became effective january   and includes prudential gibraltar financial life insurance company  ltd  or prudential gibraltar  a wholly owned subsidiary of gibraltar 

table of contents the regulatory capital levels of our domestic and international insurance subsidiaries can be materially impacted by interest rates  equity market and real estate market fluctuations  changes in the values of derivatives  the level of impairments recorded  credit quality migration of the investment portfolio  foreign exchange rate movements and business growth  among other items 
in addition  particularly for our domestic insurance subsidiaries  the recapture of business subject to reinsurance arrangements due to defaults by  or credit quality migration affecting  the reinsurers could result in higher required statutory capital levels 
our regulatory capital levels are also affected by statutory accounting rules  which are subject to change by each applicable insurance regulator 
we evaluate the regulatory capital levels of our domestic and international insurance operations under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios and believe we have adequate resources to maintain our capital levels comfortably above regulatory requirements under these scenarios 
for further information on the calculation of rbc and solvency margin ratios  as well as regulatory minimums  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
capital protection framework we employ a capital protection framework to ensure sufficient capital resources are available to maintain adequate capitalization on a consolidated basis and competitive rbc ratios and solvency margins for our insurance subsidiaries under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios 
the capital protection framework incorporates the potential impact from market related stresses  including equity markets  interest rates  credit losses  and foreign currency exchange rates 
potential sources of capital include on balance sheet capital  derivatives  reinsurance and contingent sources of capital 
although we continue to enhance our approach  we believe we currently have sufficient resources to maintain adequate capitalization and competitive rbc ratios and solvency margins under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios

our domestic life insurance subsidiaries are subject to a regulation entitled valuation of life insurance policies  commonly known as regulation xxx  and a supporting guideline entitled the application of the valuation of life insurance policies  commonly known as guideline axxx 
the regulation and supporting guideline require insurers to establish statutory reserves for term and universal life insurance policies with long term premium guarantees that are consistent with the statutory reserves required for other individual life insurance policies with similar guarantees 
many market participants believe that these levels of reserves are non economic 
we use captive reinsurance companies to implement reinsurance and capital management actions to satisfy these reserves requirements  including financing the non economic reserves through internal and external solutions 
see financing activities subsidiary borrowings financing of regulatory reserves associated with domestic life insurance products below for additional information on our financing activities related to regulation xxx and guideline axxx 
we reinsure living benefit guarantees on certain variable annuity and retirement products from our domestic life insurance companies to a domestic captive reinsurance company  pruco reinsurance  ltd  or pruco re 
this enables us to execute our living benefit hedging program primarily within one legal entity  pruco re 
as part of the living benefit hedging program  we enter into a range of exchange traded and over the counter equity and interest rate derivatives to hedge certain optional living benefit features accounted for as embedded derivatives against changes in certain capital market conditions such as interest rate and equity market exposures 
for a full discussion of our living benefits hedging program  see results of operations for financial services businesses by segment us retirement solutions and investment management division individual annuities 
we believe pruco re maintains an adequate level of capital and liquidity to support this hedging program 
however  as discussed below under liquidity associated with other activities hedging activities associated with living benefit guarantees  pruco re s capital and liquidity needs can vary significantly due to  among other things  changes in equity markets  interest rates  mortality and policyholder behavior 
through our capital protection framework  we maintain access to on balance sheet and contingent sources of capital and liquidity that are available to meet any needs as they arise 

table of contents we reinsure of the short term risks of prudential insurance s closed block business to a captive reinsurance company domiciled in new jersey 
these short term risks represent the impact of variations in experience of the closed block that are expected to be recovered over time as a result of corresponding adjustments to policyholder dividends 
the reinsurance arrangement is intended to alleviate the short term surplus volatility within prudential insurance resulting from the closed block business  including volatility caused by the impact of any unrealized mark to market losses and realized credit losses within the investment portfolio 
in october  in connection with the closed block reinsurance arrangement  we entered into a billion letter of credit facility with certain financial institutions  pursuant to which the new jersey captive can obtain a letter of credit during a year availability period to support its funding obligations under the reinsurance arrangement 
prudential financial guarantees all obligations of the new jersey captive under the facility  including its obligation to reimburse any draws made under a letter of credit 
because experience of the closed block is ultimately passed along to policyholders over time through the annual policyholder dividend  we believe that any draw under a letter of credit is unlikely 
our ability to obtain a letter of credit under the facility is subject to the continued satisfaction of customary conditions similar to those described under credit facilities below 
insurance regulators are reviewing life insurers use of captive reinsurance companies 
we cannot predict what  if any  changes may result from this review 
if applicable insurance laws are changed in a way that impairs the use of captive reinsurance companies  our financial results  liquidity and capital position may be adversely affected 
liquidity liquidity management and stress testing are performed on a legal entity basis as the ability to transfer funds between subsidiaries is limited due in part to regulatory restrictions 
liquidity needs are determined through daily and quarterly cash flow forecasting at the holding company and within our operating subsidiaries 
a target cash balance of billion is maintained to ensure adequate liquidity is available at prudential financial to cover fixed expenses in the event that we experience reduced cash flows from our operating subsidiaries 
this target balance is reviewed and approved annually by the finance committee of the board of directors 
to mitigate the risk of having limited or no access to financing due to stressed market conditions  we aim to prefund capital debt in advance of maturity 
we mitigate the refinancing risk associated with our debt that is used to fund operating needs by matching the term of debt with the assets financed 
short term financing  such as commercial paper  is used to fund short term needs only 
to ensure adequate liquidity in stress scenarios  stress testing is performed on a quarterly basis for our major operating subsidiaries 
risks to liquidity are further mitigated by our access to alternative sources of liquidity discussed below 
liquidity of prudential financial the principal sources of funds available to prudential financial  the parent holding company  are dividends and returns of capital from its subsidiaries  repayments of operating loans from subsidiaries and cash and short term investments 
these sources of funds may be supplemented by prudential financial s access to the capital markets as well as the alternative sources of liquidity described below

table of contents restrictions on dividends and returns of capital from subsidiaries our insurance companies are subject to regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends and other transfers of funds to prudential financial and other affiliates 
the payment of dividends by any of our subsidiaries is subject to declaration by their board of directors and can be affected by market conditions and other factors 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for details on specific dividend restrictions 
domestic insurance subsidiaries

international insurance subsidiaries 
our international insurance subsidiaries are subject to dividend restrictions from the regulatory authorities in the international jurisdictions in which they operate 
our most significant international insurance subsidiaries  prudential of japan and gibraltar life  are permitted to pay common stock dividends based on calculations specified by japanese insurance law  subject to prior notification to the fsa 
dividends in excess of these amounts and other forms of capital distribution require the prior approval of the fsa 
in  prudential of japan paid a dividend of billion  or million  which was ultimately sent to prudential financial 
the current regulatory fiscal year end for both prudential of japan and gibraltar life is march   at which time the common stock dividend amount permitted to be paid without prior approval from the fsa will be determinable 
although gibraltar life may be able to pay common stock dividends under these legal and regulatory restrictions  we do not anticipate receiving common stock dividends for several years as gibraltar life may return capital to prudential financial through other means  such as the repayment of subordinated debt or preferred stock obligations held by prudential financial or other affiliates 
in  gibraltar repaid billion  or million  in subordinated debt to its parent  prudential holdings of japan  of which million was ultimately sent to prudential financial 
as of december   gibraltar life had subordinated debt and preferred stock obligations to affiliates of approximately billion 
additionally  during  prudential of korea paid a dividend of million  which was ultimately sent to prudential financial 
other subsidiaries 
the ability of our asset management subsidiaries and the majority of our other operating subsidiaries to pay dividends is largely unrestricted from a regulatory standpoint 
liquidity of insurance subsidiaries we manage the liquidity of our insurance operations to ensure stable  reliable and cost effective sources of cash flows to meet all of our obligations 
liquidity within each of our insurance subsidiaries is provided by a variety of sources  as described more fully below  including portfolios of liquid assets 
the investment portfolios of our subsidiaries are integral to the overall liquidity of our insurance operations 
we segment our investment portfolios and employ an asset liability management approach specific to the requirements of each of our product lines 
this enhances the discipline applied in managing the liquidity  as well as the interest rate and credit risk profiles  of each portfolio in a manner consistent with the unique characteristics of the product liabilities 
we use a projection process for cash flows from operations to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet projected cash outflows  including claims 
liquidity is measured against internally developed benchmarks that take into account the characteristics of both the asset portfolio and the liabilities that they support 
we consider attributes of the various categories of 
table of contents liquid assets for example  type of asset and credit quality in calculating internal liquidity measures to evaluate our insurance operations liquidity under various stress scenarios  including company specific and market wide events 
we believe we have adequate liquidity in each of our insurance subsidiaries  including under these stress scenarios 
cash flow the principal sources of liquidity for our insurance subsidiaries are premiums and certain annuity considerations  investment and fee income  and investment maturities and sales associated with our insurance and annuity operations  as well as internal and external borrowings 
the principal uses of that liquidity include benefits  claims  dividends paid to policyholders  and payments to policyholders and contractholders in connection with surrenders  withdrawals and net policy loan activity 
other uses of liquidity include commissions  general and administrative expenses  purchases of investments  hedging activity and payments in connection with financing activities 
in each of our major insurance subsidiaries  we believe that the cash flows from operations are adequate to satisfy current liquidity requirements 
the continued adequacy of this liquidity will depend upon factors such as future securities market conditions  changes in interest rate levels  policyholder perceptions of our financial strength  policyholder behavior  catastrophic events and the relative safety and attractiveness of competing products  each of which could lead to reduced cash inflows or increased cash outflows 
our insurance operations cash flows from investment activities result from repayments of principal  proceeds from maturities and sales of invested assets and investment income  net of amounts reinvested 
the primary liquidity risks with respect to these cash flows are the risk of default by debtors or bond insurers  our counterparties willingness to extend repurchase and or securities lending arrangements  commitments to invest and market volatility 
we closely manage these risks through our credit risk management process and regular monitoring of our liquidity position 
domestic insurance operations 
in managing the liquidity of our domestic insurance operations  we consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions when selecting assets to support these contractual obligations 
we use surrender charges and other contract provisions to mitigate the extent  timing and profitability impact of withdrawals of funds by customers 
the following table sets forth withdrawal characteristics of our general account annuity reserves and deposit liabilities based on statutory liability values as of the dates indicated 
december  december  amount of total amount of total in billions not subject to discretionary withdrawal provisions subject to discretionary withdrawal  with adjustment with market value adjustment at market value at contract value  less surrender charge of or more subtotal subject to discretionary withdrawal at contract value with no surrender charge or surrender charge of less than total annuity reserves and deposit liabilities individual life insurance policies are less susceptible to withdrawal than our annuity reserves and deposit liabilities because policyholders may incur surrender charges and be subject to a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy 
our annuity reserves with guarantee features may be less susceptible to withdrawal than historical experience indicates  due to the perceived value of these guarantee features to policyholders as a result of market declines in recent years as well as the unavailability of comparable products in the marketplace 
annuity benefits and guaranteed investment withdrawals under group annuity contracts are generally not subject to early withdrawal 
gross account withdrawals for our domestic insurance operations products were consistent with our assumptions in asset liability management  and the associated cash outflows did not have a material adverse impact on our overall liquidity 

table of contents international insurance operations 
as with our domestic operations  in managing the liquidity of our international insurance operations  we consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions in selecting assets to support these contractual obligations 
the following table sets forth the total general account insurance related liabilities other than dividends payable to policyholders of our international insurance subsidiaries  as of the dates indicated 
december  in billions prudential of japan gibraltar life all other international insurance subsidiaries total general account insurance related liabilities other than dividends payable to policyholders as of december  and  billion and billion  respectively  of the insurance related liabilities for prudential of japan are associated with us dollar denominated products that are coinsured to our domestic insurance operations and supported by us dollar denominated assets 
includes prudential gibraltar 
represents our international insurance operations  excluding japan 
we believe most of the longer term recurring pay individual life insurance policies sold by our japanese operations do not have significant withdrawal risk because policyholders may incur surrender charges and must undergo a new underwriting process to obtain a new insurance policy 
in addition  we utilize market value adjustment features to mitigate the profitability impact and timing of withdrawals of funds by customers 
as of december   products with a market value adjustment feature represented billion of our japan operations insurance related liabilities 
recently  gibraltar life has had substantial sales of its yen denominated single premium reduced death benefit whole life product that has a greater savings component 
this product is more susceptible to increased levels of surrenders if interest rates increase in japan  which may result in losses 
as of december   single premium reduced death benefit whole life products represented billion of our japan operations insurance related liabilities 
gibraltar life also sells fixed annuities denominated in us and australian dollars that may be subject to increased surrenders should these currencies appreciate in relation to the yen and interest rates in australia and the us decline relative to japan 
as of december   fixed annuities denominated in us and australian dollars represented billion of our japan operations insurance related liabilities  of which billion include a market value adjustment feature which mitigates the profitability impact from surrenders 
liquid assets liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  fixed maturities that are not designated as held to maturity and public equity securities 
in addition to access to substantial investment portfolios  our insurance companies liquidity is managed through access to a variety of instruments available for funding and or managing cash flow mismatches  including from time to time those arising from claim levels in excess of projections 
our ability to utilize assets and liquidity between our subsidiaries is limited by regulatory and other constraints 
we believe that ongoing operations and the liquidity profile of our assets provide sufficient liquidity under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios for each of our insurance subsidiaries 

table of contents the following table sets forth the fair value of our domestic insurance operations portfolio of liquid assets  including cash and short term investments  fixed maturity investments other than those designated as held to maturity  by naic or equivalent rating  and public equity securities  as of the dates indicated 
december  prudential insurance priac other total december  in billions cash and short term investments fixed maturity investments high or highest quality other than high or highest quality subtotal public equity securities total includes palac and pruco life insurance companies the following table sets forth the fair value of our international insurance operations portfolio of liquid assets  including cash and short term investments  fixed maturity investments other than those designated as held to maturity  by naic or equivalent rating  and public equity securities  as of the dates indicated 
december  prudential of japan gibraltar life all other total december  in billions cash and short term investments fixed maturity investments high or highest quality other than high or highest quality subtotal public equity securities total includes prudential gibraltar 
represents our international insurance operations  excluding japan 
of the billion of fixed maturity investments that are not designated as held to maturity and considered high or highest quality as of december   billion  or  were invested in government or government agency bonds 
given the size and liquidity profile of our investment portfolios  we believe that claim experience  including policyholder withdrawals and surrenders  varying from our projections does not constitute a significant liquidity risk 
our asset liability management process takes into account the expected maturity of investments and expected claim payments as well as the specific nature and risk profile of the liabilities 
to the extent we need to pay claims in excess of projections  we may borrow temporarily or sell investments sooner than anticipated to pay these claims  which may result in increased borrowing costs or realized investment gains or losses affecting results of operations 
the payment of claims and sale of investments earlier than anticipated would have an impact on the reported level of cash flow from operating  investing  and financing activities  respectively  in our financial statements 
historically  there has been no significant variation between the expected maturities of our investments and the payment of claims 
liquidity associated with other activities hedging activities associated with living benefit guarantees as discussed under captive reinsurance companies above  we reinsure living benefit guarantees on certain variable annuity and retirement products from our domestic insurance companies to a captive reinsurance company  pruco re 
pruco re requires access to sufficient liquidity to support the hedging activities such as periodic settlements  purchases  maturities  terminations and breakage 
the liquidity needs can vary materially 
table of contents due to  among other items  changes in interest rates  equity markets  mortality and policyholder behavior 
currently  we fund these liquidity needs with a combination of capital contributions and loans from prudential financial and affiliates 
additionally  for certain of our domestic insurance companies to claim statutory reinsurance reserve credit for business ceded to pruco re  pruco re must collateralize its obligations under the reinsurance arrangement 
we satisfy this requirement today by depositing assets into statutory reserve credit trusts 
funding needs for the statutory reserve credit trusts are separate and distinct from capital needs of pruco re 
however  assets pledged to the statutory reserve credit trusts may include assets supporting the capital of pruco re provided that they meet eligibility requirements prescribed by the relevant insurance regulators 
reinsurance reserve credit requirements can move materially in either direction due to changes in equity markets  interest rates  actuarial assumptions and other factors 
higher reinsurance reserve credit requirements would necessitate depositing additional assets in the statutory reserve credit trusts  while lower reserve credit requirements would allow assets to be removed from the statutory reserve credit trusts 
as of december  and  for the applicable domestic insurance entities  the statutory reserve credit trusts required collateral of billion and billion respectively 
the increase in comparison to was primarily driven by actuarial assumption updates  reflecting lower long term interest rates  partially offset by the impact of higher equity markets 
the living benefits hedging activity in pruco re may also result in collateral postings on derivatives to or from counterparties 
the company s collateral position depends on changes in interest rates and equity markets related to the notional amount of the exposures hedged 
depending on market conditions  the collateral posting requirements can result in material liquidity needs 
as of december   these derivatives were in a net receive position  for which billion of collateral was posted to the company by the external counterparties 
foreign exchange hedging activities we employ various hedging strategies to manage potential exposure to foreign currency exchange rate movements  including the strategies discussed in results of operations for financial services businesses by segment international insurance division 
these hedging strategies include both internal and external hedging programs and may impact the liquidity of both prudential financial and our international insurance subsidiaries 
the internal only hedges are between a subsidiary of prudential financial and certain of our yen based entities and serve to hedge a portion of the value of us dollar denominated investments held on the books of these yen based entities 
these us dollar denominated investments are part of our hedging strategy to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on the value of our us dollar equivalent investment in our japanese subsidiaries 
absent an internal hedge  however  the changes in market value of these us dollar denominated investments attributable to changes in the yen dollar exchange rate would create volatility in the solvency margins of these subsidiaries 
to minimize this volatility  we enter into inter company hedges 
cash settlements from these hedging activities result in cash flows between prudential financial and these yen based subsidiaries 
the cash flows are dependent on changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the notional amount of the exposures hedged 
during  prudential financial received million of net cash settlements related to the internal hedge program  which were paid by the yen based subsidiaries 
as of december   the market value of the internal hedges was an asset of million due from the yen based subsidiaries 
absent any changes in forward exchange rates from those expected as of december   the million internal hedge asset represents the present value of the net cash flows to prudential financial from these entities over the life of the hedging instruments  up to years 
a significant yen depreciation over an extended period of time could result in net cash flows to prudential financial 
conversely  a significant yen appreciation could result in net cash outflows from prudential financial 
our external hedges primarily serve to hedge foreign currency denominated future income of our foreign subsidiaries and equity investments in certain of these subsidiaries 
the external hedges are between a subsidiary of prudential financial and external parties 
cash settlements on these activities result in cash flows between prudential financial and the external parties and are dependent on changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the notional amount of the exposures hedged 
during  prudential financial paid million for these international insurance related external hedge settlements 
as of december   the net asset related to these external foreign currency hedges was million 
a significant appreciation in the yen and other foreign currencies could result in net cash outflows 

table of contents asset management operations the principal sources of liquidity for our fee based asset management businesses include asset management fees and commercial mortgage origination and servicing fees 
the principal uses of liquidity include general and administrative expenses and distribution of dividends and returns of capital to prudential financial 
the primary liquidity risks for our fee based asset management businesses relate to their profitability  which is impacted by market conditions and our investment management performance 
we believe the cash flows from our fee based asset management businesses are adequate to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of these operations  as well as requirements that could arise under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios  which are monitored through the use of internal measures 
the principal sources of liquidity for our strategic investments and interim loans held in our asset management businesses are cash flows from investments  the ability to liquidate investments  and available borrowing lines from internal sources  including prudential funding and prudential financial 
the primary liquidity risks include the inability to sell assets in a timely manner  declines in the value of assets and credit defaults 
in support of our real estate business  certain real estate funds under management are held for the benefit of clients in insurance company separate accounts sponsored by prudential insurance 
in the normal course of business  prudential insurance  on behalf of these separate accounts  may contractually agree to various funding commitments which may include  among other things  commitments to purchase real estate  to invest in real estate partnerships both existing and to be formed to acquire or develop real estate  and or to fund additional construction or other expenditures on previously acquired real estate investments 
these contractual commitments are typically entered into by prudential insurance on behalf of the particular separate account 
as of december   total outstanding funding commitments related to such separate account activity was billion  of which billion was on balance sheet and billion was off balance sheet 
in the majority of cases all but billion  the commitments specify that prudential insurance s recourse liability for the obligation is limited to the assets of the applicable separate account  with no recourse to prudential insurance 
we believe that the separate accounts have sufficient resources to meet future obligations  including billion of maturities in however  there is a risk that the separate accounts may not be able to timely fund all maturing obligations from regular sources such as asset sales  operating cash flow  deposits from clients  debt refinancing or  as mentioned in note to our consolidated financial statements  from portfolio level credit facilities 
in cases where the separate account is not able to fund maturing obligations  prudential insurance may be called upon or required to provide interim funding solutions 
to date  prudential insurance has not been required to provide any such funding 
alternative sources of liquidity in addition to the sources of liquidity discussed throughout this section  prudential financial and certain subsidiaries have access to the alternative sources of liquidity described below 
asset based financing we conduct asset based or secured financing within our insurance and other subsidiaries  including transactions such as securities lending  repurchase agreements and mortgage dollar rolls to earn spread income  to borrow funds  or to facilitate trading activity 
these programs are primarily driven by portfolio holdings of securities that are lendable based on counterparty demand for these securities in the marketplace 
the collateral received in connection with these programs is primarily used to purchase securities in the short term spread portfolios of our insurance entities 
investments held in the short term spread portfolios include cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  mortgage loans and fixed maturities  including mortgage and asset backed securities  with a weighted average life at time of purchase by the short term portfolios of four years or less 
floating rate assets comprise the majority of our short term spread portfolio 
these short term portfolios are subject to specific investment policy statements  which among other things  do not allow for significant asset liability interest rate duration mismatch 

table of contents the following table sets forth our liabilities under asset based or secured financing programs attributable to the financial services businesses and closed block business as of the dates indicated

as of december   our domestic insurance entities had assets eligible for the asset based or secured financing programs of billion  of which billion were on loan 
taking into account market conditions and outstanding loan balances as of december   we believe approximately billion of the remaining eligible assets are readily lendable  of which approximately billion relates to the financial services businesses  however  these amounts are subject to potential regulatory constraints and to changes in market conditions 
in addition  as of december   our closed block business had outstanding mortgage dollar rolls  under which we are committed to repurchase million of mortgage backed securities  or tba forward contracts 
these repurchase agreements do not qualify as secured borrowings and are accounted for as derivatives 
these mortgage backed securities are considered high or highest quality based on naic or equivalent rating 
membership in the federal home loan banks prudential insurance is a member of the federal home loan bank of new york  or fhlbny 
membership allows prudential insurance access to the fhlbny s financial services  including the ability to obtain loans and to issue funding agreements as an alternative source of liquidity that are collateralized by qualifying mortgage related assets or us treasury securities

prudential financial primarily issues senior debt under its medium term note  series d program that currently has an authorized issuance capacity of billion  of which approximately billion remained available as of december  prudential financial also maintains a retail medium term notes program  including internotes that has an authorized issuance capacity of billion  of which approximately billion remained available as of december  the weighted average interest rate on prudential financial s senior notes  including the effect of interest rate hedging activity  was and for the years ended december  and  respectively  excluding the effect of debt issued to consolidated subsidiaries 
prudential financial has billion of junior subordinated notes outstanding as of december  that are considered hybrid securities and receive enhanced equity treatment from the rating agencies 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a description of the key terms of our junior subordinated notes 
during  million of medium term notes matured  and we redeemed  million of outstanding retail notes financed in part by our issuance of  million of junior subordinated notes 
as part of our overall liquidity and capital management  we may continue to redeem some or all of the remaining retail notes outstanding 
as of december   billion of outstanding retail notes were redeemable by the company at par 
subsidiary borrowings subsidiary borrowings principally consist of surplus note issuances done within our insurance and captive reinsurance subsidiaries  commercial paper borrowings by prudential funding and asset based financing 
during  prudential insurance issued billion of asset backed notes 
these notes are secured by a trust holding approximately billion of residential mortgage backed securities deposited by prudential insurance 
the deposit of these securities into the trust did not result in the recognition of gains or losses on the securities  or de recognition of the securities from the balance sheet under statutory accounting principles or us gaap  but is consistent with our tax planning strategies to monetize statutory deferred tax assets 
for additional detail on these notes  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
financing of regulatory reserves associated with domestic life insurance products as discussed above under capital insurance subsidiaries captive reinsurance companies  we use captive reinsurance companies to implement reinsurance and capital management actions  including financing regulatory non economic reserves through internal and external solutions 
these activities are described below 
during and  a captive reinsurance subsidiary entered into agreements with external counterparties providing for the issuance and sale of up to billion of ten year fixed rate surplus notes in order to finance non economic reserves required under regulation xxx 
under the agreements  the subsidiary received debt securities  with a principal amount equal to the surplus notes issued  which are redeemable under certain circumstances  including upon the occurrence of specified stress events affecting the subsidiary 
because valid rights of set off exist  interest and principal payments on the surplus notes and on the debt securities are settled on a net basis  and the surplus notes are reflected in the company s total consolidated borrowings on a net basis 
prudential financial has agreed to make capital contributions to the subsidiary in order to reimburse it for investment losses in excess of specified amounts and has agreed to make payments of principal and interest on the surplus notes in certain cases if payments are not made by the subsidiary 
as of december   no capital contributions have been made by prudential financial under this agreement 
in addition  during and  another captive reinsurance subsidiary issued billion of surplus notes to an affiliate to finance non economic reserves required under guideline axxx 

table of contents other captive reinsurance subsidiaries have outstanding an additional billion of surplus notes that were issued in through with unaffiliated institutions to finance non economic reserves required under regulation xxx and guideline axxx 
prudential financial has agreed to maintain the capital of these subsidiaries at or above a prescribed minimum level and has entered into arrangements which are accounted for as derivative instruments that require it to make certain payments in the event of deterioration in the value of these surplus notes 
as of december  and december   there were no collateral postings made under these derivative instruments 
the surplus notes described above are subordinated to policyholder obligations  and the payment of principal on the surplus notes may only be made with prior insurance regulatory approval 
the payment of interest on the surplus notes has been approved by the regulator  subject to its ability to withdraw that approval 
as we continue to underwrite term and universal life business  including as part of the hartford s individual life business acquired by us in early  we expect to have additional borrowing needs to finance non economic statutory reserves required under regulation xxx and guideline axxx 
however  we believe we have sufficient financing resources available  including those internal and external resources described above  to meet our financing needs under regulation xxx and under guideline axxx through  assuming that the volume of new business remains consistent with current sales projections 
ratings financial strength ratings which are sometimes referred to as claims paying ratings and credit ratings are important factors affecting public confidence in an insurer and its competitive position in marketing products 
nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations continually review the financial performance and financial condition of the entities they rate  including prudential financial and its rated subsidiaries 
our credit ratings are also important for our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt and for the cost of such financing 
a downgrade in the credit or financial strength ratings of prudential financial or its rated subsidiaries could potentially  among other things  limit our ability to market products  reduce our competitiveness  increase the number or value of policy surrenders and withdrawals  increase our borrowing costs and potentially make it more difficult to borrow funds  adversely affect the availability of financial guarantees  such as letters of credit  cause additional collateral requirements or other required payments under certain agreements  allow counterparties to terminate derivative agreements and or hurt our relationships with creditors  distributors  or trading counterparties thereby potentially negatively affecting our profitability  liquidity  and or capital 
in addition  we consider our own risk of non performance in determining the fair value of our liabilities 
therefore  changes in our credit or financial strength ratings may affect the fair value of our liabilities

requirements to post collateral or make other payments as a result of ratings downgrades under certain agreements  including derivative agreements  can be satisfied in cash or by posting permissible securities held by the subsidiaries subject to the agreements 
a ratings downgrade of three ratings levels from the ratings levels as of december  relating to financial strength ratings in certain cases and credit ratings in other cases would result in estimated additional collateral posting requirements or payments under such agreements of approximately million 
the amount of collateral required to be posted for derivative agreements is also dependent on the fair value of the derivative positions as of the balance sheet date 
for additional information regarding the potential impacts of a ratings downgrade on our derivative agreements see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  a ratings downgrade by am best to a for our domestic life insurance companies would require prudential insurance to post a letter of credit in the amount of approximately billion  based on the level of statutory reserves related to the variable annuity business acquired from allstate  that we estimate would result in annual cash outflows of approximately million  or collateral posting in the form of cash or securities to be held in a trust 
we believe that the posting of such collateral would not be a material liquidity event for prudential insurance 
in view of the difficulties experienced recently by many financial institutions  the rating agencies have heightened the level of scrutiny that they apply to such institutions  have increased the frequency and scope of their credit reviews  have requested additional information from the companies that they rate  and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels  such as the financial strength ratings currently held by our life insurance subsidiaries 
in addition  actions we might take to access third party financing or to realign our capital structure may in turn cause rating agencies to reevaluate our ratings 
contractual obligations the table below summarizes the future estimated cash payments related to certain contractual obligations as of december  the estimated payments reflected in this table are based on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations 
because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective  the 
table of contents actual cash outflows in future periods will vary  possibly materially  from those reflected in the table 
in addition  we do not believe that our cash flow requirements can be adequately assessed based solely upon an analysis of these obligations  as the table below does not contemplate all aspects of our cash inflows  such as the level of cash flow generated by certain of our investments  nor all aspects of our cash outflows 
estimated payments due by period total and thereafter in millions short term and long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations commitments to purchase or fund investments commercial mortgage loan commitments other liabilities insurance liabilities other total the estimated payments due by period for long term debt reflects the contractual maturities of principal  as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  as well as estimated future interest payments 
the payment of principal and estimated future interest for short term debt are reflected in estimated payments due in less than one year 
the estimate for future interest payments includes the effect of derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning our short term and long term debt 
the estimated payments due by period for operating leases reflect the future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases  as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have no significant capital lease obligations 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have commitments to purchase or fund investments  some of which are contingent upon events or circumstances not under our control  including those at the discretion of our counterparties 
the timing of the fulfillment of certain of these commitments cannot be estimated  therefore the settlement of these obligations are reflected in estimated payments due in less than one year 
commitments to purchase or fund investments include billion that we anticipate will ultimately be funded from our separate accounts 
of these separate account commitments  billion have recourse to prudential insurance if the separate accounts are unable to fund the amounts when due 
for further discussion of these separate account commitments  see liquidity liquidity associated with other activities asset management operations 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  loan commitments of our commercial mortgage operations  which are legally binding commitments to extend credit to a counterparty  have been reflected in the contractual obligations table above principally based on the expiration date of the commitment  however  it is possible these loan commitments could be funded prior to their expiration 
in certain circumstances the counterparty may also extend the date of the expiration in exchange for a fee 
the estimated payments due by period for insurance liabilities reflect future estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders and others for future policy benefits  policyholders account balances  policyholder s dividends  reinsurance payables and separate account liabilities 
these future estimated cash outflows are based on mortality  morbidity  lapse and other assumptions comparable with our experience  consider future premium receipts on current policies in force  and assume market growth and interest crediting consistent with assumptions used in amortizing deferred acquisition costs and value of business acquired 
these cash outflows are undiscounted with respect to interest and  as a result  the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table of  billion exceeds the corresponding liability amounts of billion included in the consolidated financial statements as of december  separate account liabilities are legally insulated from general account obligations  and it is generally expected these liabilities will be fully funded by separate account assets and their related cash flows 
we have made significant assumptions to determine the future estimated cash outflows related to the underlying policies and contracts 
due to the significance of the assumptions used  actual cash outflows will differ  possibly materially  from these estimates 
the estimated payments due by period for other liabilities includes securities sold under agreements to repurchase  cash collateral for loaned securities  liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits  bank customer liabilities  and other miscellaneous liabilities 
amounts presented in the table also exclude billion of notes of consolidated vie s which recourse for these obligations is limited to the assets of the respective vie and do not have recourse to the general credit of the company 
we also enter into agreements to purchase goods and services in the normal course of business  however  these purchase obligations are not material to our consolidated results of operations or financial position as of december

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk and risk management market risk is the risk of change in the value of financial instruments as a result of absolute or relative changes in  among other things  interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 
to varying degrees  the investment activities supporting all of our products and services generate exposure to market risk 
the primary source of our exposure to market risk is other than trading activities conducted primarily in our insurance and annuity operations 
the market risk incurred and our strategies for managing this risk vary by product 
the market risk associated with trading activities is immaterial 
risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk  the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns on the underlying assets or liabilities 
risk range limits are established for each type of risk  and are approved by the investment committee of the board of directors and subject to ongoing review 
our risk management process is an integral part of managing our core businesses  and utilizes a variety of risk management tools and techniques  including measures of price sensitivity to market changes eg  interest rates  foreign exchange  equity index prices value at risk  or var measures asset liability management analytics stress scenario testing disciplined hedging programs risk management governance  including risk oversight committees  policies and limits for additional information regarding the potential impacts of interest rate and other market fluctuations  as well as general economic and market conditions on our businesses and profitability  see item a

market risk related to interest rates assets that subject us to interest rate risk primarily include fixed maturity securities  commercial mortgage and other loans and policy loans 
liabilities that subject us to interest rate risk primarily include policyholder account balances relating to interest sensitive life insurance  annuity and other investment type contracts  as well as through outstanding short term and long term debt 
changes in interest rates create risk that the resulting changes in asset values will differ from the changes in the value of the liabilities relating to the underlying or hedged products 
derivatives that subject us to interest rate risk primarily include interest rate swaps  forwards  futures and options 
additionally  changes in interest rates may impact other items including  but not limited to  the following net investment spread between the amounts that we are required to pay and the rate of return we are able to earn on investments for certain products supported by general account investments asset based fees earned on assets under management or contractholder account value estimated total gross profits and the amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs net exposure to the guarantees provided under certain products equity of our regulated entities we use duration and convexity analyses to measure price sensitivity to interest rate changes 
duration measures the relative sensitivity of the fair value of a financial instrument to changes in interest rates 
convexity 
table of contents measures the rate of change of duration with respect to changes in interest rates 
we use asset liability management and derivative strategies to manage our interest rate exposure by legal entity by matching the relative sensitivity of asset and liability values to interest rate changes  or controlling duration mismatch of assets and liabilities 
we have duration mismatch constraints tailored to the rate sensitivity of products in each entity 
in certain markets  primarily outside the us and japan  capital market limitations that hinder our ability to acquire assets that closely approximate the duration of some of our liabilities are considered in setting the limits 
as of december  and  the difference between the duration of assets and the target duration of liabilities in our duration managed portfolios was within our limits 
we consider risk based capital and tax implications as well as current market conditions in our asset liability management strategies 
we assess the impact of interest rate movements on the value of our financial assets  financial liabilities and derivatives using hypothetical test scenarios that assume either upward or downward basis point parallel shifts in the yield curve from prevailing interest rates  reflecting changes in either credit spreads or the risk free rate 
the following table sets forth the net estimated potential loss in fair value on these financial instruments from a hypothetical basis point upward shift as of december  and this table is presented on a gross basis and excludes offsetting impacts to insurance liabilities that are not considered financial liabilities under u 
s gaap 
this scenario results in the greatest net exposure to interest rate risk of the hypothetical scenarios tested at those dates 
while the test scenario is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect our expectations regarding future interest rates or the performance of fixed income markets  it is a near term  reasonably possible hypothetical change that illustrates the potential impact of such events 
these test scenarios do not measure the changes in value that could result from non parallel shifts in the yield curve  which we would expect to produce different changes in discount rates for different maturities 
as a result  the actual loss in fair value from a basis point change in interest rates could be different from that indicated by these calculations 
the estimated changes in fair values do not include separate account assets associated with products for which investment risk is borne primarily by the separate account contractholders

table of contents our net estimated potential loss in fair value as of december  increased  million from december   primarily reflecting an increase in our fixed maturity securities portfolio in  driven by inflows related to two significant pension risk transfer transactions in our retirement segment  in which we received approximately billion of fixed maturity securities 
the increase was also driven by reinvestment of net investment income and a net increase in fair value driven by a decrease in interest rates 
for a discussion of changes in derivatives  see derivatives below 
under us gaap  the fair value of the embedded derivatives for certain variable annuity and other living benefit features  reflected in the table above  includes the impact of the market s perception of our own non performance risk npr 
the additional credit spread over libor rates incorporated into the discount rate as of december  to reflect npr in the valuation of these embedded derivatives ranged from to basis points 
the following table provides a demonstration of the sensitivity of these embedded derivatives to our npr credit spread by quantifying the adjustments that would be required assuming both a basis point parallel increase and decrease in our npr credit spreads 
while the information below is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect our expectations regarding our credit spreads  it is a near term  reasonably possible change that illustrates the potential impact of such a change

market risk related to equity prices we have exposure to equity price risk through our investments in equity securities  equity based derivatives and certain variable annuity and other living benefit feature embedded derivatives 
our equity based derivatives primarily hedge the equity price risk embedded in the living benefit feature embedded derivatives  and are also part of our capital hedging program 
changes in equity prices create risk that the resulting changes in asset values will differ from the changes in the value of the liabilities relating to the underlying or hedged products 
additionally  changes in equity prices may impact other items including  but not limited to  the following asset based fees earned on assets under management or contractholder account value estimated total gross profits and the amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs net exposure to the guarantees provided under certain products we actively manage investment equity price risk against benchmarks in respective markets 
we benchmark our return on equity holdings against a blend of market indices  mainly the s p and russell for us equities 
for foreign equities we benchmark against the tokyo price index  or topix  and the msci eafe  a market index of european  australian  and far eastern equities 
we target price sensitivities that approximate those of the benchmark indices 
we estimate our investment equity price risk from a hypothetical decline in equity benchmark market levels and measure this risk in terms of the decline in fair market value of equity securities we hold 
the 
table of contents following table sets forth the net estimated potential loss in fair value from such a decline as of december  and while these scenarios are for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect our expectations regarding future performance of equity markets or of our equity portfolio  they represent near term reasonably possible hypothetical changes that illustrate the potential impact of such events 
these scenarios consider only the direct impact on fair value of declines in equity benchmark market levels and not changes in asset based fees recognized as revenue  changes in our estimates of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition and other costs  or changes in any other assumptions such as market volatility or mortality  utilization or persistency rates in our variable annuity contracts that could also impact the fair value of our living benefit features 
in addition  these scenarios do not reflect the impact of basis risk  such as potential differences in the performance of the investment funds underlying the variable annuity products relative to the market indices we use as a basis for developing our hedging strategy 
the impact of basis risk could result in larger differences between the change in fair value of the equity based derivatives and the related living benefit features  in comparison to the scenarios above

market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates as a us based company with significant business operations outside the us  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to these operations  as well as related to our general account investment portfolio and other proprietary investment portfolios 
for our international insurance operations  changes in foreign currency exchange rates create risk that we may experience volatility in the us dollar equivalent earnings and value of our equity investments in these operations 
we actively manage this risk through various hedging strategies  including the use of foreign currency hedges and through holding us dollar denominated securities in the investment portfolios of certain of these operations 
additionally  certain of our international insurance operations issue product liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than their own functional currencies  and hold underlying investments denominated in the corresponding currencies 
this results in reporting of economically matched foreign currency 
table of contents exchange gains or losses on the assets and liabilities 
however  we experience volatility in us gaap earnings due to the fact that the changes in the value of the liabilities are recorded in earnings within asset management fees and other income  while changes in the value of the majority of the investments are recorded in equity in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  and  thereafter  are ultimately recorded in earnings in realized investment gains losses  net in the period of maturity  sale or other than temporary impairment 
for our domestic general account investment portfolios supporting our us insurance operations and other proprietary investment portfolios  our foreign currency exchange rate risk arises primarily from investments that are denominated in foreign currencies 
we manage this risk by hedging substantially all domestic foreign currency denominated fixed income investments into us dollars 
we generally do not hedge all of the foreign currency risk of our investments in equity securities of unaffiliated foreign entities 
we manage our foreign currency exchange rate risks within specified limits  and using var based analysis 
this statistical technique estimates  at a specified confidence level  the potential pre tax loss in portfolio market value that could occur over an assumed time horizon due to adverse market movements 
for the unhedged portions of our equity investment in international subsidiaries and the foreign currency denominated investments held in our domestic general account portfolio  we estimate the hypothetical decline in var  as well as the average var  each measured at a confidence level and using a one month time horizon 
these calculations use historical price volatilities and correlation data at a confidence level 
the following table sets forth these measures as of the periods indicated 
as of december  as of december  fair value estimated var average var fair value estimated var average var in millions unhedged portion of equity investment in international subsidiaries and foreign currency denominated investments in domestic general account portfolio excludes assets and liabilities subject to the impact of foreign exchange rate movements that are hedged with externally purchased derivatives or are economically matched  as discussed above 
the decrease in var as of december  was driven by a lower level of foreign exchange rate volatility 
for derivatives used to hedge the anticipated level of us dollar equivalent earnings of our international operations  the estimated hypothetical decline in var  measured at a confidence level and using a one month time horizon was million and million as of december  and december   respectively

although var models are a recognized tool for risk management  they have inherent limitations  including reliance on historical data that may not be indicative of future market conditions or trading patterns 
accordingly  var models should not be viewed as a predictor of future results 
we may incur losses that could be materially in excess of the amounts indicated by the models on a particular trading day or over a period of time  and there have been instances when results have fallen outside the values generated by our var models 
a var model does not estimate the greatest possible loss 
the results of these models and analysis thereof are subject to the judgment of our risk management personnel 
derivatives we use derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce market risk from changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates  including to alter interest rate or foreign currency exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities 
our derivatives primarily include swaps  futures  options and forward contracts that are exchange traded or contracted in the over the counter market 
our derivatives also include interest rate guarantees we provide on our synthetic gic products 
synthetic gics simulate the performance of traditional insurance related gics but  under us gaap  are accounted for as 
table of contents derivatives due to the fact that the policyholders own the underlying assets  and we only provide a book value wrap on the customers funds  which are held in a client owned trust 
since these wraps provide payment of guaranteed principal and interest to the customer  changes in interest rates create risk that declines in the market value of customers funds would increase our net exposure to these guarantees 
however  this risk is minimal due to several mitigating factors 
our obligation is limited to payments that are in excess of the existing customers fund value 
additionally  we have the ability to periodically reset crediting rates  subject to a minimum floor  as well as the ability to increase prices
