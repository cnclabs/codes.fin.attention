general business information sources and availability of raw materials the principal raw materials used by goodyear are natural and synthetic rubber 
natural rubber typically accounts for approximately half of all rubber consumed by us on an annual basis 
we purchase all of our requirements for natural rubber in the world market 
our plants located in beaumont and houston  texas supply the major portion of our global synthetic rubber requirements 
other important raw materials and components we use are carbon black  steel cord  fabrics and petrochemical based commodities 
substantially all of these raw materials and components are purchased from independent suppliers  except for certain chemicals we manufacture 
we purchase most raw materials and components in significant quantities from several suppliers  except in those instances where only one or a few qualified sources are available 
we anticipate the continued availability of all raw materials and components we will require during  subject to spot shortages and unexpected disruptions caused by natural disasters such as hurricanes and other similar events 
substantial quantities of fuel and other petrochemical based commodities are used in the production of tires  synthetic rubber and other products 
supplies of such fuels and commodities have been and are expected to continue to be available to us in quantities sufficient to satisfy our anticipated requirements  subject to spot shortages 
in  raw material costs increased by approximately in our tire businesses compared to  primarily driven by an increase in the cost of synthetic rubber and carbon black 
for the full year of  we expect our raw material costs will be lower than however  natural and synthetic rubber prices and other commodity prices have experienced significant volatility  and this estimate could change significantly based on fluctuations in the cost of these and other key raw materials

we own  control or use approximately  different trademarks  including several using the word goodyear or the word dunlop 
approximately  registrations and pending applications worldwide protect these trademarks 
while such trademarks as a group are important  the only trademarks we consider material to our business  or to the business of any of our segments  are those using the word goodyear  and with respect to certain of our international business segments  those using the word dunlop 
we believe our trademarks are valid and most are of unlimited duration as long as they are adequately protected and appropriately used 
backlog our backlog of orders is not considered material to  or a significant factor in  evaluating and understanding any of our business segments or our businesses considered as a whole 

table of contents research and development our direct and indirect expenditures on research  development and certain engineering activities relating to the design  development and significant modification of new and existing products and services and the formulation and design of new  and significant improvements to existing  manufacturing processes and equipment during the periods indicated were year ended december  in millions research and development expenditures employees at december   we employed approximately  full time and temporary people throughout the world  including approximately  people covered under collective bargaining agreements

these expenditures are expected to be sufficient to comply with existing environmental laws and regulations and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive position 
in the future  we may incur increased costs and additional charges associated with environmental compliance and cleanup projects necessitated by the identification of new waste sites  the impact of new environmental laws and regulatory standards  or the availability of new technologies

table of contents item a 
risk factors 
you should carefully consider the risks described below and other information contained in this annual report on form k when considering an investment decision with respect to our securities 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  or that we currently deem immaterial  may also impair our business operations 
any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur 
if they do  our business  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity could be materially adversely affected 
in such an instance  the trading price of our securities could decline  and you might lose all or part of your investment 
if we do not successfully implement our strategic initiatives  our operating results  financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected 
our business continues to be impacted by trends that have negatively affected the tire industry in general  as the economic recovery in developed markets was impacted by uncertainty surrounding debt and other fiscal policy issues in europe and the united states and continued high levels of unemployment 
these negative trends include volatile raw material costs  rising energy costs  wage inflation in emerging markets  and continued pressure from our unfunded pension obligations 
in addition  global tire industry demand continues to be difficult to predict 
if these overall trends continue or worsen  then our operational and financial condition could be adversely affected 
unlike most other tire manufacturers  we also face the continuing burden of significant legacy pension costs 
in order to offset the impact of these trends  we have announced important strategic initiatives  such as increasing our low cost manufacturing capacity  reducing our high cost manufacturing capacity  such as the announced closure of one of our facilities in amiens  france  increasing sales in emerging markets  improving the profitability of our emea segment  and funding our us pension plans once frozen 
we are also undertaking significant capital investments in new  expanded and modernized manufacturing facilities around the world 
the failure to implement successfully our important strategic initiatives may materially adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
the announced closure of one of our facilities in amiens  france remains subject to consultation with the european central works council  our employee representatives and other relevant bodies in the emea region 
as the required consultation process has just begun  we are not able to currently estimate the timing of plan completion nor can we assure you of the ultimate outcome of the consultation process 
implementation of our pension funding strategy depends on  among other things  our ability to access the debt capital markets 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to access those markets on terms that are acceptable to us or at all 
see the risk factor below concerning our ability to access the capital markets  our long term ability to meet our obligations  to repay maturing indebtedness or to implement strategic initiatives may be dependent on our ability to access capital markets in the future and to improve our operating results 
our performance is also dependent on our ability to continue to improve the proportion  or mix  of higher margin tires we sell 
in order to continue this improvement  we must be successful in marketing and selling products that offer higher margins such as the assurance  fuel max  eagle  ultra grip and fortera lines of tires and in developing additional higher margin tires that achieve broad market acceptance 
shifts in consumer demand away from higher margin tires could materially adversely affect our business 
we cannot assure you that our strategic initiatives will be successful 
if not  we may not be able to achieve or sustain future profitability  which would impair our ability to meet our debt and other obligations and would otherwise negatively affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
our pension plans are significantly underfunded and  in the future  the underfunding levels of our pension plans and our pension expense could materially increase 
although we have frozen a number of our pension plans globally  including our us salaried pension plans  and closed participation in our primary us hourly pension plan  many of our employees participate in  and many of our former employees are entitled to benefits under  defined benefit pension plans 
over time  we have experienced periods of declines in interest rates and pension asset values 
as a result  our pension plans are significantly underfunded 
further declines in interest rates or the market values of the securities held by the plans  or certain other changes  could materially increase the underfunded status of our plans in and beyond and affect the level and timing of required contributions in and beyond 
for further information regarding the investment funds and strategies of our pension plans  see item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview pension and benefit plans and the note to the consolidated financial statements no 
 pension  other postretirement benefits and savings plans 
the unfunded amount of the projected benefit obligation for our us and non us pension plans was  million and million  respectively  at december   and we currently estimate that we will be required to make contributions to our funded us pension plans of approximately million to million in  and million to million in the current underfunded status of our pension plans will  and a further 
table of contents material increase in the underfunded status of the plans would  significantly increase our required contributions and pension expense  which could impair our ability to achieve or sustain future profitability and adversely affect our financial condition 
we face significant global competition and our market share could decline 
new tires are sold under highly competitive conditions throughout the world 
we compete with other tire manufacturers on the basis of product design  performance  price and terms  reputation  warranty terms  customer service and consumer convenience 
on a worldwide basis  we have two major competitors  bridgestone based in japan and michelin based in france  that have large shares of the markets of the countries in which they are based and are aggressively seeking to maintain or improve their worldwide market share 
other significant competitors include continental  cooper  hankook  kumho  pirelli  toyo  yokohama and various regional tire manufacturers 
our competitors produce significant numbers of tires in low cost countries  and have announced plans to further increase their production capacity in low cost countries 
our ability to compete successfully will depend  in significant part  on our ability to continue to innovate and manufacture the types of tires demanded by consumers  and to reduce costs by such means as reducing excess and high cost capacity  leveraging global purchasing  improving productivity  eliminating redundancies and increasing production at low cost supply sources 
if we are unable to compete successfully  our market share may decline  materially adversely affecting our results of operations and financial condition 
higher raw material and energy costs may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
raw material costs increased significantly over the past few years  and may continue to do so  driven by increases in prices of natural and synthetic rubber  carbon black and petrochemical based commodities 
market conditions or contractual obligations may prevent us from passing these increased costs on to our customers through timely price increases 
additionally  higher raw material costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure 
as a result  higher raw material and energy costs could result in declining margins and operating results and adversely affect our financial condition 
the volatility of raw material costs may cause our margins  operating results and liquidity to fluctuate 
if we fail to extend or renegotiate our primary collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions as they expire from time to time  or if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption  our business  results of operations  financial position and liquidity could be materially adversely affected 
we are a party to collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions  which represent a significant number of our employees 
our master collective bargaining agreement with the usw covers approximately  employees in the united states at december   and expires july  in addition  approximately  of our employees outside of the united states are covered by union contracts that have expired or are expiring in  primarily in germany  france  poland  brazil  china and venezuela 
although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory  no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements as they expire from time to time 
if we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements  if disputes with our unions arise  or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption  we could experience a significant disruption of  or inefficiencies in  our operations or incur higher labor costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
our long term ability to meet our obligations  to repay maturing indebtedness or to implement strategic initiatives may be dependent on our ability to access capital markets in the future and to improve our operating results 
the adequacy of our liquidity depends on our ability to achieve an appropriate combination of operating improvements  financing from third parties and access to capital markets 
we may need to undertake additional financing actions in the capital markets in order to ensure that our future liquidity requirements are addressed or to implement strategic initiatives 
these actions may include the issuance of additional debt or equity 
our access to the capital markets cannot be assured and is dependent on  among other things  the ability and willingness of financial institutions to extend credit on terms that are acceptable to us  or to honor future draws on our existing lines of credit  and the degree of success we have in implementing our strategic initiatives and improving the results of our emea segment and sustaining our results in our north american tire segment 
concerns regarding the effect of the european sovereign debt crisis on financial institutions in europe and elsewhere could have an adverse impact on the european and global capital markets and on our ability to access those markets to finance our european business or our business globally 
future liquidity requirements  or our inability to access cash deposits or make draws on our lines of credit  also may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt 
a substantial portion of our assets is subject to liens securing our indebtedness 
as a result  we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness 

table of contents our inability to access the capital markets or incur additional debt in the future could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations  and could require us to consider further measures  including deferring planned capital expenditures or our pension funding strategy  reducing discretionary spending  selling additional assets and restructuring existing debt 
financial difficulties  work stoppages  supply disruptions or economic conditions affecting our major oe customers  dealers or suppliers could harm our business 
the economic recovery in developed markets has been negatively impacted by uncertainty surrounding debt and other fiscal policy issues in europe and the united states and continued high levels of unemployment 
as a result of these economic conditions  our tire unit shipments in were down compared to  and automotive vehicle production and global tire industry demand continues to be difficult to predict 
although sales to our oe customers account for less than of our net sales  demand for our products by oe customers and production levels at our facilities are impacted by automotive vehicle production 
we may experience future declines in sales volume due to declines in new vehicle sales  the discontinuation or sale of certain oe brands  platforms or programs  or weakness in the demand for replacement tires  which could result in us incurring under absorbed fixed costs at our production facilities or slowing the rate at which we are able to recover those costs 
automotive production can also be affected by labor relation issues  financial difficulties or supply disruptions 
our oe customers could experience production disruptions resulting from their own or supplier labor  financial or supply difficulties 
such events may cause an oe customer to reduce or suspend vehicle production 
as a result  an oe customer could halt or significantly reduce purchases of our products  which would harm our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
in addition  the bankruptcy  restructuring or consolidation of one or more of our major oe customers  dealers or suppliers could result in the write off of accounts receivable  a reduction in purchases of our products or a supply disruption to our facilities  which could negatively affect our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
our capital expenditures may not be adequate to maintain our competitive position and may not be implemented in a timely or cost effective manner 
our capital expenditures are limited by our liquidity and capital resources and the amount we have available for capital spending is limited by the need to pay our other expenses and to maintain adequate cash reserves and borrowing capacity to meet unexpected demands that may arise 
we believe that our ratio of capital expenditures to sales is lower than the comparable ratio for our principal competitors 
productivity improvements through process re engineering  design efficiency and manufacturing cost improvements may be required to offset potential increases in labor and raw material costs and competitive price pressures 
in addition  as part of our strategy to increase the percentage of tires that are produced at our lower cost production facilities and to increase our capacity to produce higher margin tires  we may need to modernize or expand our facilities 
for example  we made a significant investment in a new manufacturing facility in pulandian  china  which began tire production in we are also currently undertaking significant expansion and modernization projects at our manufacturing facilities in santiago  chile  tatsuno  japan  americana  brazil  lawton  oklahoma  and throughout emea in connection with new european tire labeling requirements 
we may not have sufficient resources to implement planned capital expenditures with minimal disruption to our existing manufacturing operations  or within desired time frames and budgets 
any disruption to our operations  delay in implementing capital improvements or unexpected costs may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
if we are unable to make sufficient capital expenditures  or to maximize the efficiency of the capital expenditures we do make  we may be unable to achieve productivity improvements  which may harm our competitive position 
in addition  plant modernizations may temporarily disrupt our manufacturing operations and lead to temporary increases in our costs 

table of contents we have a substantial amount of debt  which could restrict our growth  place us at a competitive disadvantage or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial health 
we have a substantial amount of debt 
as of december   our debt including capital leases on a consolidated basis was approximately billion 
our substantial amount of debt and other obligations could have important consequences 
for example  it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations  impair our ability to obtain financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  pension funding  research and development  acquisitions or general corporate requirements  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we would need to dedicate a substantial portion of these funds for payments on our indebtedness  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors 
the agreements governing our debt  including our credit agreements  limit  but do not prohibit  us from incurring additional debt and we may incur a significant amount of additional debt in the future  including additional secured debt 
if new debt is added to our current debt levels  our ability to satisfy our debt obligations may become more limited 
our ability to make scheduled payments on  or to refinance  our debt and other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance  which  in turn  is subject to our ability to implement our strategic initiatives  prevailing economic conditions and certain financial  business and other factors beyond our control 
if our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations  including required pension contributions  we may be forced to reduce or delay expansion plans and capital expenditures or our pension funding strategy  sell material assets or operations  obtain additional capital or restructure our debt 
we cannot assure you that our operating performance  cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient to pay our debt obligations when they become due 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to dispose of material assets or operations or restructure our debt or other obligations if necessary or  even if we were able to take such actions  that we could do so on terms that are acceptable to us 
any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our debt instruments  or a material reduction in the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility  could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations 
the indentures and other agreements governing our secured credit facilities  senior unsecured notes and our other outstanding indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us 
these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise 
these restrictions limit our ability to  among other things incur additional debt or issue redeemable preferred stock  pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments or investments  incur liens  sell assets  incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us  enter into affiliate transactions  engage in sale leaseback transactions  and engage in certain mergers or consolidations or transfers of substantially all of our assets 
availability under our first lien revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base  which is based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
to the extent that our eligible accounts receivable and inventory decline  our borrowing base will decrease and the availability under that facility may decrease below its stated amount 
in addition  if at any time the amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under that facility exceeds the borrowing base  we are required to prepay borrowings and or cash collateralize letters of credit sufficient to eliminate the excess 
our ability to comply with these covenants or to maintain our borrowing base may be affected by events beyond our control  including deteriorating economic conditions  and these events could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing or to reduce expenditures 
we cannot assure you that such waivers  amendments or alternative financing could be obtained  or if obtained  would be on terms acceptable to us 
a breach of any of the covenants or restrictions contained in any of our existing or future financing agreements  including the financial covenants in our secured credit facilities  could result in an event of default under those agreements 
such a default could allow the lenders under our financing agreements  if the agreements so provide  to discontinue lending  to accelerate the related debt as well as any other debt to which a cross acceleration or cross default provision applies  and or to declare all borrowings 
table of contents outstanding thereunder to be due and payable 
in addition  the lenders could terminate any commitments they have to provide us with further funds 
if any of these events occur  we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds available to pay in full the total amount of obligations that become due as a result of any such acceleration  or that we will be able to find additional or alternative financing to refinance any such accelerated obligations 
even if we obtain additional or alternative financing  we cannot assure you that it would be on terms that would be acceptable to us 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to remain in compliance with the covenants to which we are subject in the future and  if we fail to do so  that we will be able to obtain waivers from our lenders or amend the covenants 
our international operations have certain risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
we have manufacturing and distribution facilities throughout the world 
our international operations are subject to certain inherent risks  including exposure to local economic conditions  adverse changes in the diplomatic relations of foreign countries with the united states  hostility from local populations and insurrections  adverse foreign currency fluctuations  adverse currency exchange controls  withholding taxes and restrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings  labor regulations  expropriations of property  the potential instability of foreign governments  risks of renegotiation or modification of existing agreements with governmental authorities  export and import restrictions  and other changes in laws or government policies 
the likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable 
certain regions  including latin america  asia  the middle east and africa  are inherently more economically and politically volatile and as a result  our business units that operate in these regions could be subject to significant fluctuations in sales and operating income from quarter to quarter 
because a significant percentage of our operating income in recent years has come from these regions  adverse fluctuations in the operating results in these regions could have a disproportionate impact on our results of operations in future periods 
for example  the european sovereign debt crisis has negatively affected economic conditions in europe and globally 
our emea segment contributed of our net sales and of our total segment operating income in if the european sovereign debt crisis continues or deepens  economic conditions in europe may further deteriorate 
in that case  our business in europe and elsewhere  as well as the businesses of our customers and suppliers  may be adversely affected 
as a further example  since  venezuela has imposed currency exchange controls that fix the exchange rate between the venezuelan bolivar fuerte and the us dollar and restrict the ability to exchange bolivares fuertes for dollars 
these restrictions have delayed and limited our ability to pay third party and affiliated suppliers and to otherwise repatriate funds from venezuela  and may continue to do so  which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity 
in addition  if we are unable to pay these suppliers in a timely manner  they may cease supplying us 
venezuela has also imposed restrictions on the importation of certain raw materials 
if these suppliers cease supplying us or we are unable to import necessary raw materials  we may need to reduce or halt production in venezuela  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
we have material bolivar fuerte denominated net monetary assets and liabilities in venezuela  the value of which will be correspondingly reduced in the event of a devaluation of the bolivar fuerte by the venezuelan government 
the future results of our venezuelan operations will be affected by many factors  including actions by the venezuelan government such as further currency devaluations  economic conditions in venezuela such as inflation and consumer spending  and the availability of raw materials  utilities and energy 
goodyear venezuela contributes a significant portion of the sales and operating income of our latin american tire segment 
as a result  any disruption of goodyear venezuela s operations or of our ability to pay suppliers or repatriate funds from venezuela could have a material adverse impact on the future performance of our latin american tire segment and could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
in addition  compliance with complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions 
these numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include import and export laws  anti competition laws  anti corruption laws  such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the us bribery act  and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials  data privacy requirements  tax laws  and 
table of contents accounting  internal control and disclosure requirements 
violations of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal fines  penalties and sanctions against us  our officers or our employees  prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries  and could also materially affect our reputation  business and results of operations 
in certain foreign jurisdictions  there is a higher risk of fraud or corruption and greater difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls and compliance programs 
although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations  there can be no assurance that our employees  contractors or agents will not violate our policies or applicable laws and regulations 
we have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
the financial position and results of operations of many of our international subsidiaries are initially recorded in various foreign currencies and then translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our financial statements 
the strengthening of the us dollar against these foreign currencies ordinarily has a negative impact on our reported sales and operating margin and conversely  the weakening of the us dollar against these foreign currencies has a positive impact 
for the year ended december   foreign currency translation unfavorably affected sales by million and unfavorably affected segment operating income by million compared to the year ended december  the volatility of currency exchange rates may materially adversely affect our operating results 
we have material euro denominated net monetary assets and liabilities 
if the european sovereign debt crisis leads to a significant devaluation of the euro  the value of our euro denominated net monetary assets and liabilities would be correspondingly reduced when translated into us dollars for inclusion in our financial statements 
similarly  the re introduction of certain individual country currencies or the complete dissolution of the euro  could adversely affect the value of our euro denominated net monetary assets and liabilities 
in either case  our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected 
our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk  which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 
certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk 
if interest rates increase  our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same  which would require us to use more of our available cash to service our indebtedness 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into swap agreements or other hedging arrangements in the future  or that existing or future hedging arrangements will offset increases in interest rates 
as of december   we had approximately billion of variable rate debt outstanding 
we have substantial fixed costs and  as a result  our operating income fluctuates disproportionately with changes in our net sales 
we operate with significant operating and financial leverage 
significant portions of our manufacturing  selling  administrative and general expenses are fixed costs that neither increase nor decrease proportionately with sales 
in addition  a significant portion of our interest expense is fixed 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to reduce our fixed costs proportionately in response to a decline in our net sales and therefore our competitiveness could be significantly impacted 
as a result  a decline in our net sales would result in a higher percentage decline in our income from operations and net income 
we may incur significant costs in connection with our contingent liabilities and tax matters 
we have significant reserves for contingent liabilities and tax matters 
the major categories of our contingent liabilities include workers compensation  product liability and other tort claims  including asbestos claims  and environmental matters 
our recorded liabilities and estimates of reasonably possible losses for our contingent liabilities are based on our assessment of potential liability using the information available to us at the time and  where applicable  any past experience and recent and current trends with respect to similar matters 
our contingent liabilities are subject to inherent uncertainties  and unfavorable judicial or administrative decisions could occur which we did not anticipate 
such an unfavorable decision could include monetary damages  fines or other penalties or an injunction prohibiting us from taking certain actions or selling certain products 
if such an unfavorable decision were to occur  it could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations in the period in which the decision occurs  or in future periods 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations  including with respect to transfer pricing 
while we apply consistent transfer pricing policies and practices globally  support transfer prices through economic studies  seek advance pricing agreements and joint audits to the extent possible and believe our transfer prices to be appropriate  such transfer prices  and related interpretations of tax laws  are occasionally challenged by various taxing 
table of contents authorities globally 
we have received various tax assessments challenging our interpretations of applicable tax laws in various jurisdictions 
although we believe we have complied with applicable tax laws  have strong positions and defenses and have historically been successful in defending such claims  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in the case we are unsuccessful in the defense of existing or future claims 
for further information regarding our contingent liabilities and tax matters  refer to the note to the consolidated financial statements  no 
 commitments and contingent liabilities 
for further information regarding our accounting policies with respect to certain of our contingent liabilities and uncertain income tax positions  refer to item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies 
we may be required to provide letters of credit or post cash collateral if we are subject to a significant adverse judgment or if we are unable to obtain surety bonds  which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
we are subject to various legal proceedings 
if we wish to appeal any future adverse judgment in any of these proceedings  we may be required to post an appeal bond with the relevant court 
in that case  we may be required to issue a letter of credit to the surety posting the bond 
we may issue up to an aggregate of million in letters of credit under our billion us senior secured first lien credit facility 
as of december   we had million in letters of credit issued and  million of remaining availability under this facility 
if we are subject to a significant adverse judgment and do not have sufficient availability under our credit facilities to issue a letter of credit to support an appeal bond  we may be required to pay down borrowings under the facilities or deposit cash collateral in order to stay the enforcement of the judgment pending an appeal 
if we are unable to post cash collateral  we may be unable to stay enforcement of the judgment 
under standard terms in the surety market  sureties issue or continue bonds on a case by case basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the posting of collateral as a condition to issuing or renewing any bonds 
if surety providers were to limit or eliminate our access to bonding  we would need to post other forms of collateral  such as letters of credit or cash 
as described above  we may be unable to secure sufficient letters of credit under our credit facilities 
if we were subject to a significant adverse judgment or experienced an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity  we may be required to provide letters of credit or post cash collateral  which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
we are subject to extensive government regulations that may materially adversely affect our operating results 
we are subject to regulation by the department of transportation through the national highway traffic safety administration  or nhtsa  which has established various standards and regulations applicable to tires sold in the united states and tires sold in a foreign country that are identical or substantially similar to tires sold in the united states 
nhtsa has the authority to order the recall of automotive products  including tires  having safety related defects 
the transportation recall enhancement  accountability  and documentation act  or tread act  imposes numerous requirements with respect to the early warning reporting of warranty claims  property damage claims  and bodily injury and fatality claims and also requires tire manufacturers  among other things  to comply with revised and more rigorous tire testing standards 
compliance with the tread act regulations has increased the cost of producing and distributing tires in the united states 
in addition  while we believe that our tires are free from design and manufacturing defects  it is possible that a recall of our tires  under the tread act or otherwise  could occur in the future 
a substantial recall could have a material adverse effect on our reputation  operating results and financial position 
in addition  as required by the energy independence and security act of  nhtsa will establish a national tire fuel efficiency consumer information program 
when the related rule making process is completed  certain tires sold in the united states will be required to be rated for rolling resistance  traction and tread wear 
while the federal law will preempt state tire fuel efficiency laws adopted after january   we may become subject to additional tire fuel efficiency legislation  either in the united states or other countries 
our european operations are subject to regulation by the european union 
in  two important regulations  the tire safety regulation and the tire labeling regulation  applicable to tires sold in the european union were adopted 
the tire safety regulation sets performance standards that tires for cars and light and commercial trucks need to meet for rolling resistance  wet grip braking passenger car only and noise in order to be sold in the european union  and became effective beginning in  with continuing phases that will become effective through the tire labeling regulation applies to all passenger car  light truck and commercial truck tires produced after july  and requires  after november   that consumers be informed about the tire fuel efficiency  wet grip and noise characteristics 
other countries  such as brazil  have also adopted tire labeling regulations  and additional countries may also introduce similar regulations in the future 
tires produced or sold in europe also have to comply with various other standards  including environmental laws such as reach registration  evaluation  authorisation and restriction of chemical substances  which regulates the use of chemicals in the 
table of contents european union 
for example  since january   reach has prohibited the use of highly aromatic oils in tires  which were used as compounding components to improve certain performance characteristics 
these us and european regulations  rules adopted to implement these regulations  or other similar regulations that may be adopted in the united states  europe or elsewhere in the future may require us to alter or increase our capital spending and research and development plans or cease the production of certain tires  which could have a material adverse affect on our operating results 
laws and regulations governing environmental and occupational safety and health are complicated  change frequently and have tended to become stricter over time 
as a manufacturing company  we are subject to these laws and regulations both inside and outside the united states 
we may not be in complete compliance with such laws and regulations at all times 
our costs or liabilities relating to them may be more than the amount we have reserved  and that difference may be material 
in addition  our manufacturing facilities may become subject to further limitations on the emission of greenhouse gases due to public policy concerns regarding climate change issues or other environmental or health and safety concerns 
while the form of any additional regulations cannot be predicted  a cap and trade system similar to the one adopted in the european union could be adopted in the united states 
any such cap and trade system including the system currently in place in the european union or other limitations imposed on the emission of greenhouse gases could require us to increase our capital expenditures  use our cash to acquire emission credits or restructure our manufacturing operations  which could have a material adverse affect on our operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
compliance with the laws and regulations described above or any of the myriad of applicable foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations currently in effect or that may be adopted in the future could materially adversely affect our competitive position  operating results  financial condition and liquidity

we have also received a similar request for information from european antitrust authorities in connection with a similar investigation of the marine hose industry in europe 
in addition  in november  the brazilian antitrust authority notified goodyear s brazilian subsidiary that it was a party to a civil investigation into alleged anticompetitive practices in the marine hose industry in brazil 
based on our review  we continue to believe goodyear and its subsidiaries did not engage in unlawful conduct which is the subject of the investigations described above

greek labor cases in a series of cases  approximately former employees of a factory in thessaloniki  greece that was closed in sued goodyear dunlop tires hellas saic goodyear dunlop greece seeking compensation in arrears alleging the absence of consultation prior to the closure under applicable european law 
following extensive litigation at all levels of the greek courts and the european court of justice over the past years  the greek court of appeal issued judgments in september and october affirming goodyear dunlop greece liability to pay salaries in arrears with respect to the year period following the plant closure and permitting a reduction in the amount of that liability to the extent of severance payments previously paid to the former employees 
however  the court of appeal failed to consider evidence of incomes earned in other capacities and the retirement of certain former employees during that period  which should have further reduced the employees claims for salaries in arrears  and failed to follow applicable supreme court precedents limiting the period of time for which salaries in arrears are payable 
goodyear dunlop greece has filed an appeal before the greek supreme court in order to seek to rectify these failures 
if goodyear dunlop greece appeal is not successful  its liability with respect to these judgments is currently estimated to be approximately million million 
in addition  goodyear dunlop greece may be liable for social security contributions and payroll taxes related to any salaries in arrears it must ultimately pay 
goodyear dunlop greece is vigorously defending these cases  the ultimate outcome of which cannot be predicted at this time

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the goodyear tire rubber company is one of the world s leading manufacturers of tires  with one of the most recognizable brand names in the world and operations in most regions of the world 
we have a broad global footprint with manufacturing facilities in countries  including the united states 
we operate our business through four operating segments representing our regional tire businesses north american tire  europe  middle east and africa tire  latin american tire  and asia pacific tire 
we continued to experience weak industry conditions in as the economic recovery in developed markets was impacted by uncertainty surrounding debt and other fiscal policy issues in europe and the united states and continued high levels of unemployment  which had a negative impact on overall economic conditions and customer and consumer confidence 
our tire unit shipments in decreased compared to  primarily as a result of continued weakness in europe 
in addition  our raw material costs rose by approximately in compared to in spite of the macroeconomic and industry specific challenges we faced  we produced segment operating income greater than billion for the second consecutive year  including record segment operating income of million in north american tire 
price and product mix drove an improvement in revenue per tire  excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  in compared to  reflecting our continued focus on innovative product offerings in targeted market segments 
in  we realized approximately million of cost savings  bringing the total cost savings for to to approximately billion and exceeding our billion goal 
we also completed the transition to our new manufacturing facility in pulandian  china and realized continued improvements in working capital efficiency  measured as a percent of sales 
in order to address the uncertain economic environment and the challenges described above  we remain focused on our key strategies continue to focus on consumer driven product development  take a selective approach to the market  targeting profitable segments where we have competitive advantages  improve our manufacturing efficiency and create an advantaged supply chain focused on optimizing inventory levels and further improving customer service  focus on cash flow to provide funding for investments in future growth  and build top talent and teams 
to address continued economic weakness in europe and the significant challenges that we face in emea  we have announced the exit of the farm tire business in emea and the closure of one of our amiens  france manufacturing facilities  as well as a profit improvement plan over the next three years aimed at restoring the margins in emea to historical levels 
the profit improvement plan aims to target profitable segments where we have competitive advantages  accelerate our growth in emerging markets in the region  and achieve million to million of productivity improvements through back office consolidation  improved manufacturing efficiency and supply chain improvements 
in addition  in order to address our significant unfunded pension obligations  we have announced plans to fund our us pension plans once frozen 
see pension and benefit plans for additional information 
for the year ended december   goodyear net income was million  compared to goodyear net income of million in  and goodyear net income available to common shareholders was million  compared to goodyear net income available to common shareholders of million in our total segment operating income for was  million  compared to  million in the decrease in segment operating income was due primarily to lower tire volume  including the effects of under absorbed overhead on increased conversion costs  and an increase in raw material costs  partially offset by improved price and product mix 
see results of operations segment information for additional information 
net sales were billion in  compared to billion in net sales decreased due to lower tire volumes  unfavorable foreign currency translation  primarily in emea  and lower sales in other tire related businesses  primarily sales of chemical products in north american tire 
these decreases were partially offset by improved price and product mix 
pension and benefit plans during  our us pension plans experienced actuarial losses from further decreases in discount rates and increases in estimated life expectancies  which increased plan obligations by million 
these losses more than offset the effect of actual returns on us pension plan assets in that exceeded expected returns by million 
as a result  net actuarial losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss aocl increased by million during annual us net periodic pension 
table of contents cost will decrease to approximately million to million in from million in  due primarily to expected returns on higher plan assets following contributions to us pension plans of approximately million 
we have announced plans to accelerate funding of our us pension plans once frozen and to reduce our exposure to future interest rate and equity market movements 
we intend to finance the additional contributions by accessing the debt capital markets 
as funded levels increase  we plan to shift our us pension plan asset allocation to a portfolio of fixed income securities designed to offset the future impact of discount rate movements on the plans funded status 
at december   our unfunded us pension liability was approximately billion  of which approximately billion is attributable to us pension plans that have been frozen  including our principal us salaried pension plans  and approximately billion is attributable to our other us pension plans  including our principal us hourly pension plans 
if additional plans become frozen  we intend to accelerate funding and shift the asset allocation of those plans as well 
as a result of this strategy  we expect to limit the growth of our unfunded us pension liability  which in turn is expected to improve our operating cash flow and reduce the volatility of our earnings  liquidity needs and overall leverage  thereby allowing us to focus on our core business 
implementation of this strategy depends on  among other things  our ability to access the debt capital markets 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to access those markets on terms that are acceptable to us or at all 
as a precursor to the strategy described above  we have entered into short term hedging strategies to reduce our exposure to market movements during for further information on these short term hedging strategies  see critical accounting policies pensions and other postretirement benefits and note to the consolidated financial statements no 
 pension  other postretirement benefits and savings plans 
liquidity at december   we had  million in cash and cash equivalents as well as  million of unused availability under our various credit agreements  compared to  million and  million  respectively  at december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was driven by capital expenditures of  million  including expenditures for the continued expansion of our china and chile manufacturing capacity  pension contributions and direct payments of million and net debt repayments of million 
these decreases were partially offset by improvements in working capital of million and net income of million  which included non cash depreciation and amortization of million 
we believe that our liquidity position is adequate to fund our operating and investing needs in and to provide us with flexibility to respond to further changes in the business environment 
new products in  we launched our new goodyear assurance cs tripletred all season  goodyear eagle f asymmetric all season  goodyear eagle f asymmetric  goodyear ultragrip winter and dunlop signature ii tire lines in north american tire 
we also successfully launched three new tire and six new retread product lines in our commercial truck tire business  focusing on regional  mixed service  and long haul applications 
at our north american tire dealer conference in early  we introduced several key products  most notably the goodyear eagle sport all season and goodyear wrangler all terrain adventure tire lines  and several new dunlop branded tires including the sport maxx race  sport maxx rt  sp winter sport d and the winter maxx 
in emea  we launched the new goodyear ultragrip performance and goodyear ultragrip ice artic winter tires 
for dunlop  we also launched sportmaxx rt  which is an ultra high performance summer tire  and ice touch  which is a winter studdable tire 
we introduced the new marathon coach and ultragrip coach range of commercial coach tires which are focused on addressing the specific segment needs of comfort  mileage and traction 
we also launched our new trailer tire for mixed service applications  part of the max technology family 
in latin american tire  we launched the goodyear eagle excellence aquamax ayrton senna edition and goodyear assurance cs tripletred all season 
we also launched the goodyear efficientgrip suv with quiettred technology and the goodyear eagle f asymmetric for commercial  we launched citymax  a new tire for city service applications that is designed to deliver improved treadwear performance 
in asia pacific tire  we launched the goodyear efficientgrip suv 
in addition  we successfully produced our first winter tire range  the goodyear ultra grip ice for the northern asia markets 
in australia  we launched the dunlop sport maxx rt 
we also launched new commercial vehicle series steer and drive tires in china 
these are goodyear first commercial tires for heavy duty trucks and large buses designed and manufactured specifically for the chinese market 

table of contents outlook we continue to expect long term growth in the global tire industry  but at a slower pace near term due primarily to continued economic weakness in europe 
for the full year of in north america  we expect consumer replacement to be flat to up  consumer original equipment to be up approximately  and commercial replacement and original equipment to be flat 
for the full year in europe  we expect consumer replacement to be flat to up  consumer original equipment to be down approximately  commercial replacement to be up approximately  and commercial original equipment to be flat to up 
we expect that our full year tire unit volume for will reflect a low single digit percentage growth rate compared to for the full year of  we expect our raw material costs will be lower than and expect to realize a net benefit from raw material costs and price and product mix 
however  natural and synthetic rubber prices and other commodity prices have experienced significant volatility  and this estimate could change significantly based on fluctuations in the cost of these and other key raw materials 
in order to mitigate some of the impact of raw material costs  we are continuing to focus on price and product mix  to substitute lower cost materials where possible and to work to identify additional substitution opportunities  to reduce the amount of material required in each tire  and to pursue alternative raw materials including innovative bio based materials 
however  during periods of rapidly rising raw material costs  we may not be able to fully offset those raw material cost increases through the use of these strategies  although we remain confident in our ability to do so over the longer term 
we have announced the exit of the farm tire business in emea and the closure of one of our amiens  france manufacturing facilities 
these actions would eliminate approximately six million units of high cost physical capacity  although we currently produce approximately million tires per year at the amiens  france manufacturing facility 
these actions are expected to improve emea operating income by approximately million annually  as compared to results  following the closure 
as the required consultation process has just begun  we are not able to currently estimate the timing of plan completion 
we do not expect to be significantly impacted by incremental unabsorbed fixed costs in we also expect cost savings to offset general inflation in see item a

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes to the financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  management reviews its estimates  based on currently available information 
changes in facts and circumstances may alter such estimates and affect our results of operations and financial position in future periods 
our critical accounting policies relate to general and product liability and other litigation  workers compensation  recoverability of goodwill  deferred tax asset valuation allowances and uncertain income tax positions  and pensions and other postretirement benefits 
general and product liability and other litigation 
we have recorded liabilities totaling million  including related legal fees expected to be incurred  for potential product liability and other tort claims  including asbestos claims  presently asserted against us at december  general and product liability and other litigation liabilities are recorded based on management s assessment that a loss arising from these matters is probable 
if the loss can be reasonably estimated  we record the amount of the estimated loss 
if the loss is estimated within a range and no point within the range is more probable than another  we record the minimum amount in the range 
as additional information becomes available  any potential liability related to these matters is assessed and the estimates are revised  if necessary 
loss ranges are based upon the specific facts of each claim or class of claims and are determined after review by counsel 
court rulings on our cases or similar cases may impact our assessment of the probability and our estimate of the loss  which may have an impact on our reported results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
we record receivables for insurance recoveries related to our litigation claims when it is probable that we will receive reimbursement from the insurer 
specifically  we are a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging various asbestos related personal injuries purported to result from alleged exposure to asbestos in certain products manufactured by us or present in certain of our facilities 
typically  these lawsuits have been brought against multiple defendants in federal and state courts 
a significant assumption in our estimated asbestos liability is the period over which the liability can be reasonably estimated 
due to the difficulties in making these estimates  analysis based on new data and or changed circumstances arising in the future may result in an increase in the recorded obligation in an amount that cannot be reasonably estimated  and that increase may be significant 
we had recorded gross liabilities for both asserted and unasserted asbestos claims  inclusive of defense costs  totaling million at december  the portion of the liability associated with unasserted asbestos claims and related defense costs was million 
we maintain primary insurance coverage under coverage in place agreements  and also have excess liability insurance with respect to asbestos liabilities 
we record a receivable with respect to such policies when we determine that recovery is probable and we can reasonably estimate the amount of a particular recovery 
this determination is based on consultation with our outside legal counsel and taking into consideration agreements with certain of our insurance carriers  the financial viability and legal obligations of our insurance carriers and other relevant factors 
as of december   we recorded a receivable related to asbestos claims of million  and we expect that approximately of asbestos claim related losses would be recoverable through insurance through the period covered by the estimated liability 
of this amount  million was included in current assets as part of accounts receivable at december  the recorded receivable consists of an amount we expect to collect under coverage in place agreements with certain primary carriers as well as an amount we believe is probable of recovery from certain of our excess coverage insurance carriers 
workers compensation 
we had recorded liabilities  on a discounted basis  of million for anticipated costs related to us workers compensation claims at december  the costs include an estimate of expected settlements on pending claims  defense costs and a provision for claims incurred but not reported 
these estimates are based on our assessment of potential liability using an analysis of available information with respect to pending claims  historical experience and current cost trends 
the amount of our ultimate liability in respect of these matters may differ from these estimates 
we periodically  and at least annually  update our loss development factors based on actuarial analyses 
the liability is discounted using the risk free rate of return 
for further information on general and product liability and other litigation  and workers compensation  refer to the note to the consolidated financial statements no 
 commitments and contingent liabilities 
recoverability of goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an indicator of impairment is present 
goodwill totaled million at december  
table of contents we have determined our reporting units to be consistent with our operating segments comprised of four strategic business units north american tire  europe  middle east and africa tire  latin american tire and asia pacific tire 
goodwill is allocated to these reporting units based on the original purchase price allocation for acquisitions within the various reporting units 
there have been no changes to our reporting units or in the manner in which goodwill was allocated in guidance under accounting standards codification asc  intangibles goodwill and other  requires an entity to test goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis  with the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary or to perform a quantitative assessment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
under the qualitative assessment  an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
if under the quantitative assessment the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then the amount of the impairment loss  if any  must be measured 
after considering changes to assumptions used in our most recent quantitative annual testing  including the capital markets environment  economic conditions  tire industry competition and trends  changes in our results of operations  the magnitude of the excess of fair value over the carrying amount of each reporting unit as determined in our most recent quantitative annual testing  and other factors  we concluded it is more likely than not that the fair value of our north american tire and asia pacific tire reporting units is not less than its respective carrying value and  therefore  did not perform a quantitative analysis 
given the current economic conditions in europe and the segment operating results of our emea reporting unit  we concluded that it was necessary to perform a quantitative analysis in connection with our annual goodwill impairment assessment for that reporting unit 
we determined the estimated fair value of our emea reporting unit using a discounted cash flow approach consistent with the methodology used in our most recent quantitative annual testing 
the key assumptions incorporated in the discounted cash flow approach include a growth rate  projected segment operating income  changes in our plan for capital expenditures  anticipated funding for pensions  and a discount rate equal to our assumed long term cost of capital 
based on the testing performed in accordance with asc  the annual impairment test indicated there was no impairment of goodwill in our emea reporting unit since the fair value exceeded the carrying value 
deferred tax asset valuation allowances and uncertain income tax positions 
at december   we had valuation allowances aggregating billion against all of our net federal and state and certain of our foreign net deferred tax assets 
we assess both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
evidence  such as operating results during the most recent three year period  is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability  which are inherently uncertain 
our losses in the us and certain foreign locations in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against our net federal  state and certain of our foreign deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain valuation allowances against our net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the realization of such assets 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations  including those for transfer pricing 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we also recognize income tax benefits to the extent that it is more likely than not that our positions will be sustained when challenged by the taxing authorities 
we derecognize income tax benefits when based on new information we determine that it is no longer more likely than not that our position will be sustained 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established  or determine we need to derecognize tax benefits recorded in prior periods  our results of operations and effective tax rate in a given period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash  and lead to recognition of expense to the extent the settlement amount exceeds recorded liabilities and  in the case of an income tax settlement  result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution 
to reduce our risk of an unfavorable transfer price settlement  the company applies consistent transfer pricing policies and practices globally  supports pricing with economic studies and seeks advance pricing agreements and joint audits to the extent possible 
a favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction of expense to the extent the settlement amount is lower than recorded liabilities and  in the case of an income tax settlement  would result in a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution 
we report interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income taxes 
for additional information regarding uncertain income tax positions and valuation allowances  refer to the note to the consolidated financial statements no 
 income taxes 

table of contents pensions and other postretirement benefits 
we have recorded liabilities for pension and other postretirement benefits of approximately billion and billion  respectively  at december  our recorded liabilities for pensions and other postretirement benefits are based on a number of assumptions  including life expectancies  retirement rates  discount rates  long term rates of return on plan assets  inflation rates  future compensation levels  future health care costs  and maximum company covered benefit costs 
certain of these assumptions are determined with the assistance of independent actuaries 
assumptions about life expectancies  retirement rates  future compensation levels and future health care costs are based on past experience and anticipated future trends 
the discount rate for our us plans is based on a yield curve derived from a portfolio of corporate bonds from issuers rated aa or higher as of december and is reviewed annually 
our expected benefit payment cash flows are discounted based on spot rates developed from the yield curve 
the long term rate of return on plan assets is based on the compound annualized return of our us pension fund over a period of years or more  estimates of future long term rates of return on assets similar to the target allocation of our pension fund and long term inflation 
actual us pension fund asset allocations are reviewed on a monthly basis and the pension fund is rebalanced to target ranges on an as needed basis 
these assumptions are reviewed regularly and revised when appropriate 
changes in one or more of them may affect the amount of our recorded liabilities and net periodic costs for these benefits 
other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age  mortality and turnover are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect our experience and expectations for the future 
if the actual experience differs from expectations  our financial position  results of operations and liquidity in future periods may be affected 
the weighted average discount rate used in estimating the total liability for our us pension and other postretirement benefit plans was and  respectively  at december   compared to and  respectively  at december  the decrease in the discount rate at december  was due primarily to lower interest rate yields on highly rated corporate bonds 
interest cost included in our us net periodic pension cost was million in  compared to million in and million in interest cost included in our worldwide net periodic other postretirement benefits cost was million in  compared to million in and million in the following table presents the sensitivity of our us projected pension benefit obligation  accumulated other postretirement benefits obligation  and annual expense to the indicated increase decrease in key assumptions change at december  dollars in millions change pbo abo annual expense pensions assumption discount rate expected return on assets n a other postretirement benefits assumption discount rate health care cost trends total cost subsequent to december   substantially all of our us pension plans entered into short term zero cost interest rate option strategies in order to significantly reduce the volatility of our us pension funded status 
changes in general interest rates and corporate aa or better credit spreads impact our discount rate and thereby our us pension liability 
if general interest rates were to decrease in parallel ie  across all maturities  the interest rate option strategies would mitigate approximately of the impact of the expected rise in the pension benefit obligation 
if general interest rates were to increase in parallel  the interest rate option strategies would limit the benefit of higher interest rates on our pension benefit obligation after interest rates increase 
table of contents beyond specified levels  or caps 
for example  a increase in these rates would result in approximately a offset to the expected decrease in the pension benefit obligation and a increase would result in approximately a offset 
the options strategies have no impact on changes in our discount rate and thereby our pension liability that may occur due to movements in corporate aa or better credit spreads 
at the same time  we entered into short term zero cost equity collars that cap upside and limit downside on a portion of the pension plans us equity portfolio 
these agreements initially cover of our equity position and decline to during the year 
a significant portion of the net actuarial loss included in aocl of  million in our us pension plans as of december  is a result of the overall decline in us discount rates over time and plan asset losses 
for purposes of determining our us net periodic pension expense  our funded status was such that we recognized million of the net actuarial loss in we will recognize approximately million of net actuarial losses in if our future experience is consistent with our assumptions as of december   actuarial loss recognition over the next few years will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in before it begins to gradually decline 
the actual rate of return on our us pension fund was  and in  and  respectively  as compared to the expected rate of for all three years 
we use the fair value of our pension assets in the calculation of pension expense for all of our us pension plans 
we experienced a decrease in our us discount rate at the end of and a large portion of the net actuarial loss included in aocl of million in our worldwide other postretirement benefit plans as of december  is a result of the overall decline in us discount rates over time 
for purposes of determining worldwide net periodic other postretirement benefits cost  we recognized million of the net actuarial losses in we will recognize approximately million of net actuarial losses in if our future experience is consistent with our assumptions as of december   actuarial loss recognition over the next few years will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in before it begins to gradually decline

liquidity and capital resources overview our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operating and financing activities 
our cash flows from operating activities are driven primarily by our operating results and changes in our working capital requirements and our cash flows from financing activities are dependent upon our ability to access credit or other capital 
we experienced weak industry conditions in as the economic recovery in developed markets was impacted by uncertainty surrounding debt and other fiscal policy issues in europe and the united states and continued high levels of unemployment  which had a negative impact on overall economic conditions 
at december   we had solid liquidity  with approximately billion of cash and cash equivalents and unused availability under our credit facilities 
in  we have taken significant steps to improve our capital structure through the following actions issued million of senior notes due  and used the proceeds of that note issuance to redeem all of our outstanding million senior notes due  amended and restated our existing us first lien revolving credit facility by extending the maturity from to and increasing the available commitments from billion to billion  and amended and restated our existing us second lien term loan facility by extending the maturity from to for further information on the other strategic initiatives we pursued in  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview 
at december   we had  million in cash and cash equivalents  compared to  million at december  for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was  million  primarily driven by net income of million  which includes non cash depreciation and amortization of million  and an improvement in working capital of million  partially offset by pension contributions of million 
net cash used by investing activities was  million in and million in  primarily driven by capital expenditures of  million in and  million in net cash used by financing activities was million in  compared to net cash provided of million in 
table of contents financing activities in included net debt repayments of million 
financing activities in included million in net proceeds from the issuance of our mandatory convertible preferred stock and net borrowings of million to fund working capital needs and capital expenditures 
at december  and  we had  million and  million  respectively  of unused availability under our various credit agreements 
the table below provides unused availability by our significant credit facilities as of december in millions first lien revolving credit facility european revolving credit facility chinese credit facilities pan european accounts receivable facility due other domestic and international debt notes payable and overdrafts at december   our unused availability included million that can only be used to finance the relocation and expansion of our manufacturing facility in china 
we have deposited our cash and cash equivalents and entered into various credit agreements and derivative contracts with financial institutions that we considered to be substantial and creditworthy at the time of such transactions 
we seek to control our exposure to these financial institutions by diversifying our deposits  credit agreements and derivative contracts across multiple financial institutions  by setting deposit and counterparty credit limits based on long term credit ratings and other indicators of credit risk such as credit default swap spreads  and by monitoring the financial strength of these financial institutions on a regular basis 
we also enter into master netting agreements with counterparties when possible 
by controlling and monitoring exposure to financial institutions in this manner  we believe that we effectively manage the risk of loss due to nonperformance by a financial institution 
however  we cannot provide assurance that we will not experience losses or delays in accessing our deposits or lines of credit due to the nonperformance of a financial institution 
our inability to access our cash deposits or make draws on our lines of credit  or the inability of a counterparty to fulfill its contractual obligations to us  could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial position or results of operations in the period in which it occurs 
in  we expect our operating needs to include global contributions to our funded pension plans of approximately million to million and our investing needs to include capital expenditures of approximately billion to billion 
we also expect interest expense to range between million and million and  when and if future dividends are declared  dividends on our mandatory convertible preferred stock to be million 
we intend to operate the business in a way that allows us to address these needs with our existing cash and available credit if they cannot be funded by cash generated from operations 
the moving ahead for progress in the st century act the map act was signed into law on july  and contains provisions that stabilize the interest rates used to calculate required pension contributions in the united states 
current historically low interest rates have resulted in significant increases to required pension contributions 
the funding stabilization provisions of the map act are expected to reduce our total us minimum required pension contributions by approximately million to million in the aggregate over the next five years  with the greatest benefit coming in and we currently estimate that we will be required to make contributions to our funded us pension plans of approximately million to million in and million to million in for additional information  see item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations commitments and contingent liabilities

description of goodyear s business global alliance 
as of the date of this filing  sri has not provided us notice of any exit rights that have become exercisable 
our ability to service debt and operational requirements is also dependent  in part  on the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions of cash to various other entities in our consolidated group  whether in the form of dividends  loans or otherwise 
in certain countries where we operate  such as china  venezuela and south africa  transfers of funds into or out of such countries by way of dividends  loans  advances or payments to third party or affiliated suppliers are generally or periodically subject to certain requirements  such as obtaining approval from the foreign government and or currency exchange board before net assets can be transferred out of the country 
in addition  certain of our credit agreements and other debt instruments limit the ability of foreign subsidiaries to make distributions of cash 
thus  we would have to repay and or amend these credit agreements and other 
table of contents debt instruments in order to use this cash to service our consolidated debt 
because of the inherent uncertainty of satisfactorily meeting these requirements or limitations  we do not consider the net assets of our subsidiaries  including our chinese  venezuelan and south african subsidiaries  that are subject to such requirements or limitations to be integral to our liquidity or our ability to service our debt and operational requirements 
at december   approximately million of net assets  including million of cash and cash equivalents  were subject to such requirements  including million of cash in venezuela 
the requirements we must comply with to transfer funds out of china and south africa have not adversely impacted our ability to make transfers out of those countries 
effective january   venezuela s economy was considered to be highly inflationary under us generally accepted accounting principles since it experienced a rate of general inflation in excess of over the latest three year period  based upon the blended consumer price index and national consumer price index 
accordingly  the us dollar was determined to be the functional currency of our venezuelan subsidiary 
all gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of its financial statements since january  were determined using official exchange rates and are reported in other expense 
venezuela remained a highly inflationary economy for us gaap purposes during on february   the venezuelan government announced the devaluation of its currency  the bolivar fuerte  effective february  the announcement indicated that the official exchange rate would be changed from bolivares fuertes to each us dollar to bolivares fuertes to each us dollar 
as a result  we expect to record a charge in the first quarter of in connection with the remeasurement of our balance sheet to reflect the devaluation 
if calculated at the announced official exchange rate of  the charge is expected to be approximately million  net of tax 
as the announcement provided limited details  we are not able to fully assess the effect of the changes on our future results of operations 
further information will be available on february  when the government is expected to publish the decree in the official gazette 
for further information regarding the venezuelan currency devaluation and its anticipated impact on goodyear  see item business recent developments venezuelan currency devaluation and for a discussion of the risks related to our international operations  including venezuela  see item a 
risk factors 
if in the future we convert bolivares fuertes at a rate other than the official exchange rate or the official exchange rate is revised  we may realize additional losses that would be recorded in the statement of operations 
at december   we had bolivar fuerte denominated monetary assets of million  which consisted primarily of million of cash  million of deferred tax assets and million of accounts receivable  and bolivar fuerte denominated monetary liabilities of million which consisted primarily of million of intercompany payables  including million of dividends  million of accounts payable trade  million of long term benefits  million of compensation and benefits and million of income taxes payable 
at december   we had bolivar fuerte denominated monetary assets of million  which consisted primarily of million of cash  million of deferred tax assets and million of accounts receivable  and bolivar fuerte denominated monetary liabilities of million which consisted primarily of million of intercompany payables  including million of dividends  million of accounts payable trade  million of compensation and benefits and million of income taxes payable 
all monetary assets and liabilities were remeasured at bolivares fuertes to the us dollar at december  and goodyear venezuela s sales were and of our net sales for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
goodyear venezuela s cost of goods sold was and of our cost of goods sold for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
goodyear venezuela s sales are bolivar fuerte denominated and cost of goods sold are approximately bolivar fuerte denominated and approximately us dollar denominated 
a further decrease in the bolivar fuerte to us dollar exchange rate would decrease goodyear venezuela s sales and cost of goods sold by approximately million and approximately million  respectively  on an annual basis  before any potential offsetting actions 
during the twelve months ended december   goodyear venezuela settled million and million of us dollar denominated intercompany payables and accounts payable trade  respectively  through the venezuelan currency exchange board 
for the twelve months ended december   substantially all of those payables were settled at the official exchange rate of bolivares fuertes to the us dollar 
at december   settlements of us dollar denominated liabilities pending before the currency exchange board were million 
due to the government recent announcement of the devaluation of the bolivar fuerte and lack of a published decree  we are not currently able to determine the exchange rate at which these transactions will settle 
at december   million of the requested settlements were pending up to days  million were pending from to days and million were pending over one year 
amounts pending up to days include imported tires and raw materials of million  amounts pending from to days include imported tires and raw materials of million  and amounts pending over one year include dividends payable of million  intercompany charges for royalties of million  and imported tires of million 
currency exchange controls in venezuela continue to limit our ability to remit funds from venezuela 
goodyear venezuela contributed a significant portion of latin american tire s sales and operating income in and we continue to face operational challenges in venezuela  including inflationary cost pressures  high absenteeism  and difficulties importing raw materials and finished goods 
in response to conditions in venezuela  we continue to evaluate the need to adjust 
table of contents prices for our products while remaining competitive and have taken steps to address our operational challenges  including securing necessary approvals for import licenses and increasing the local production of certain tires 
our pricing policies take into account factors such as fluctuations in raw material and other production costs  market demand and adherence to government price controls 
we believe that our liquidity position is adequate to fund our operating and investing needs and debt maturities in and to provide us with flexibility to respond to further changes in the business environment 
if market opportunities exist  we may choose to undertake additional financing actions in order to further enhance our liquidity position  which could include obtaining new bank debt or capital markets transactions 
however  the challenges we face may cause a material reduction in our liquidity as a result of an adverse change in our cash flow from operations or our access to credit or other capital

table of contents merge  sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets 
these covenants are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications 
we have additional financial covenants in our first lien revolving and second lien credit facilities that are currently not applicable 
we only become subject to these financial covenants when certain events occur 
these financial covenants and related events are as follows we become subject to the financial covenant contained in our first lien revolving credit facility when the aggregate amount of our parent company the goodyear tire rubber company and guarantor subsidiaries cash and cash equivalents available cash plus our availability under our first lien revolving credit facility is less than million 
if this were to occur  our ratio of ebitda to consolidated interest expense may not be less than to for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters 
as of december   our availability under this facility of  million  plus our available cash of million  totaled billion  which is in excess of million 
we become subject to a covenant contained in our second lien credit facility upon certain asset sales 
the covenant provides that  before we use cash proceeds from certain asset sales to repay any junior lien  senior unsecured or subordinated indebtedness  we must first offer to use such cash proceeds to prepay borrowings under the second lien credit facility unless our ratio of consolidated net secured indebtedness to ebitda pro forma senior secured leverage ratio for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters is equal to or less than to in addition  our amended and restated european revolving credit facility contains non financial covenants similar to the non financial covenants in our first and second lien credit facilities that are described above and a financial covenant applicable only to gdte and its subsidiaries 
this financial covenant provides that we are not permitted to allow gdte s ratio of consolidated net jv indebtedness to consolidated european jv ebitda for a period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to be greater than to at the end of any fiscal quarter 
consolidated net jv indebtedness is determined net of the sum of cash and cash equivalents in excess of million held by gdte and its subsidiaries  cash and cash equivalents in excess of million held by the parent company and its us subsidiaries and availability under our first lien revolving credit facility if the ratio of ebitda to consolidated interest expense described above is not applicable and the conditions to borrowing under the first lien revolving credit facility are met

this financial covenant is also included in our pan european accounts receivable securitization facility 
at december   we were in compliance with this financial covenant 
our amended and restated credit facilities also state that we may only incur additional debt or make restricted payments that are not otherwise expressly permitted if  after giving effect to the debt incurrence or the restricted payment  our ratio of ebitda to consolidated interest expense for the prior four fiscal quarters would exceed to certain of our senior note indentures have substantially similar limitations on incurring debt and making restricted payments 
our credit facilities and indentures also permit the incurrence of additional debt through other provisions in those agreements without regard to our ability to satisfy the ratio based incurrence test described above 
we believe that these other provisions provide us with sufficient flexibility to incur additional debt necessary to meet our operating  investing and financing needs without regard to our ability to satisfy the ratio based incurrence test 
there are no known future changes to  or new covenants in  any of our existing debt obligations other than as described above 
covenants could change based upon a refinancing or amendment of an existing facility  or additional covenants may be added in connection with the incurrence of new debt

potential future financings in addition to our previous financing activities  we may seek to undertake additional financing actions which could include restructuring bank debt or capital markets transactions  possibly including the issuance of additional debt or equity 
given the challenges that we face and the uncertainties of the market conditions  access to the capital markets cannot be assured 
our future liquidity requirements may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt 
however  a substantial portion of our assets are already subject to liens securing our indebtedness 
as a result  we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness 
in addition  no assurance can be given as to our ability to raise additional unsecured debt

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we utilize derivative financial instrument contracts and nonderivative instruments to manage interest rate  foreign exchange and commodity price risks 
we have established a control environment that includes policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval  reporting and monitoring of derivative financial instrument activities 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
commodity price risk the raw materials costs to which our operations are principally exposed include the cost of natural rubber  synthetic rubber  carbon black  fabrics  steel cord and other petrochemical based commodities 
approximately two thirds of our raw materials are oil based derivatives  the cost of which may be affected by fluctuations in the price of oil 
we currently do not hedge commodity prices 
we do  however  use various strategies to partially offset cost increases for raw materials  including centralizing purchases of raw materials through our global procurement organization in an effort to leverage our purchasing power  expanding our capabilities to substitute lower cost raw materials and reducing the amount of natural rubber required in each tire 
interest rate risk we continuously monitor our fixed and floating rate debt mix
