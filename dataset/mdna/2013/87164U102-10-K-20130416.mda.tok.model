in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
where possible  we have tried to identify these forward looking statements by using words such as anticipate  believe  intends  or similar expressions 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by the forward looking statements due to important factors and risks including  but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors in part i  item a of this report 
overview we are a biotechnology company focused on the development of biologics for the prevention and treatment of serious infectious diseases 
we are developing an oral enzyme for the prevention of c 
difficile infections  and a series of monoclonal antibody therapies for the treatment of pertussis and acinetobacter infections 
in addition  we are developing a drug candidate for the treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis and cognitive dysfunction in multiple sclerosis  and have partnered the development of a treatment for fibromyalgia

summary of infectious disease programs clostridium difficile c 
difficile infections in november  we acquired a series of oral beta lactamase enzymes pa  pa and pa and related assets targeting the prevention of c 
difficile infections cdi  the leading cause of hospital acquired infections hai  that generally occurs secondary to treatment with intravenous antibiotics 
the acquired assets include a pre investigational new drug ind package for pa syn  phase i and phase ii clinical data for pa  manufacturing processes and data  and a portfolio of issued and pending us and international patents intended to support an ind and biologic license application bla with the fda 
utilizing this portfolio of assets  we intend to develop a proprietary oral beta lactamase enzyme product candidate  syn  previously known as ipsat pa 
when co administered with certain intravenous beta lactam antibiotics  it is expected that syn can degrade the antibiotic that is excreted in the gastrointestinal gi tract  thus preserving the natural balance of the patient microflora  and preventing opportunistic infections including cdi 
beta lactam antibiotics are a mainstay in hospital infection management and include the commonly used penicillin and cephalosporin classes of antibiotics 
according to globaldata  an estimated million americans were administered intravenous beta lactam antibiotics in pertussis in december  in collaboration with intrexon corporation intrexon  we initiated development of a monoclonal antibody mab therapy for the treatment of pertussis infections  more commonly known as whooping cough 
we are developing a mab therapy  syn  designed to target and neutralize the pertussis toxin  in order to reduce the mortality rate in infants and potentially shorten the duration of chronic cough in afflicted adults 
to further the development of this potential therapy for pertussis  we entered into an agreement with the university of texas at austin to license the rights to certain research and pending patents related to pertussis antibodies 
according to the world health organization  each year  b 
pertussis infection causes an estimated  deaths worldwide  primarily among young  unvaccinated children 
acinetobacter infections in september  in collaboration with intrexon  we initiated efforts to develop a mab therapy for the treatment of acinetobacter infections 
many strains of acinetobacter are multidrug resistant and pose an increasing global threat to hospitalized patients  wounded military personnel and those affected by natural disasters 
a treatment for acinetobacter infections represents a multi billion dollar market opportunity 
summary of multiple sclerosis program trimesta tm oral estriol is being developed as an oral once daily treatment for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis ms in women 
patient enrollment is complete in this two year  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled phase ii clinical trial being conducted at centers in the us the primary endpoint is relapse rate at two years  with top line results expected in h this trial is supported by grants exceeding million  which should be sufficient to fund the trial through completion 
current sales of injectable disease modifying therapies for ms are estimated at billion annually 
trimesta tm is also being developed for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in female ms patients 
this month randomized  double blind  placebo controlled phase ii clinical trial is being conducted at university of california  los angeles ucla 
the primary endpoint is the effect on cognitive function as assessed by paced auditory serial addition test pasat 
patient enrollment is ongoing 
the majority of the costs of this trial are being funded by grants from foundations and charitable organizations and we have pledged approximately  to ucla to partially fund this trial payable over three years 
an estimated of ms patients are expected to develop disabilities due to cognitive dysfunction and there is currently no approved treatment 
summary of fibromyalgia program effirma tm flupirtine is being developed for the treatment of fibromyalgia by meda ab meda  a multi billion dollar international pharmaceutical company 
on may   we entered into a sublicense agreement with meda covering all of our patents rights on the use of flupirtine for fibromyalgia in the us  canada and japan 
the sublicense agreement provides that all ongoing and future development costs are to borne by meda and we are entitled to receive certain payments if milestones are achieved and royalties on sales 
according to meda s year end report filed in february  meda has received the go ahead from the fda to conduct a phase ii proof of concept study for the treatment of fibromyalgia 
meda also announced that the randomized  double blind  placebo and active controlled study of patients with fibromyalgia will be conducted at clinics in the us based on an estimated annual price of  per fibromyalgia patient  we estimate that the total market potential in the us is billion 
to prioritize our focus on the development of product candidates for the prevention and treatment of serious infectious diseases  we do not intend to pursue further development of our previously announced program for pulmonary arterial hypertension 
however  we are currently in discussions with intrexon to substitute this program with an alternate program better suited to our current objectives and focus 
in order to further prioritize our focus  we have elected to discontinue further development of aen for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
however  we are currently seeking development partners for our zinc based intellectual property and assets including  aen recent developments on december   we entered into a patent license agreement the license agreement with the university of texas at austin the university for the exclusive license of the right to use  develop  manufacture  market and commercialize certain research and patents related to pertussis more commonly known as whooping cough antibodies developed in the lab of dr 
jennifer a 
maynard  assistant professor of chemical engineering 
in connection with the license agreement  we and the university also entered into a sponsored research agreement pursuant to which the university will perform certain research work related to pertussis under the direction of dr 
jennifer maynard and we will obtain certain rights to patents and technology developed during the course of such research 
on november   a closing was held for the transaction contemplated by the asset purchase agreement the prev agreement we entered into with prev abr llc prev  pursuant to which we acquired the c

on october   we completed a private placement the october private placement with certain accredited investors  pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a price per share of the common shares for aggregate gross proceeds of million and net proceeds of million 
in connection with the october private placement  we filed a registration statement with the sec which was declared effective on december  for the resale of our common stock owned by certain of the purchasers in the october private placement 
in connection with the october private placement  we also entered into an agreement with a certain purchaser that is an affiliate of intrexon the joinder agreement pursuant to which such purchaser agreed to be bound by the terms of and join intrexon as a party to its registration rights agreement with us entered into in connection with the second channel agreement 
griffin securities  inc griffin served as the placement agent for the october private placement

the common stock underlying the agent warrants was registered under the registration statement declared effective on december  on august   we expanded our relationship with intrexon and entered into a second channel agreement with intrexon the second channel agreement that governs an exclusive channel collaboration arrangement in which we will use intrexon s technology relating to the identification  design and production of human antibodies and dna vectors for the development and commercialization of a series of monoclonal antibody therapies for the treatment of certain serious infectious diseases the program 
the second channel agreement establishes committees comprised of our and intrexon representatives that will govern activities related to the program in the areas of project establishment  chemistry  manufacturing and controls  clinical and regulatory matters  commercialization efforts and intellectual property 
on october   a closing was held for the transaction contemplated by the second channel agreement 
pursuant to the terms of a stock issuance agreement with intrexon the second stock purchase agreement  we issued  shares of our common stock  par value  which issuance is also deemed paid in consideration for the execution and delivery of the second channel agreement  dated august   between ourselves and intrexon 
we also agreed to register the shares issued to intrexon in accordance with the first amendment to registration rights agreement 
on february   upon stockholder approval  we amended our articles of incorporation to change our name to synthetic biologics  inc our common stock continues trade on the nyse mkt formerly the nyse amex and american stock exchange  under the symbol syn 
prior to this time and since october   our name was adeona pharmaceuticals  inc and we traded on the nyse mkt stock exchange under the symbol aen 
we are incorporated in the state of nevada 
we maintain principal executive offices at gibbs street  suite  rockville  maryland  and we maintain an administrative and finance office in ann arbor  michigan 
on december   we announced that the board of directors had taken several actions to prioritize our focus on our entry into the emerging field of synthetic biology 
in connection with the change in business focus on march   we entered into a membership interest purchase agreement  and certain related agreements  pursuant to which we sold all of our interest in the adeona clinical laboratory the lab to hartlab  llc  an entity controlled by the lab s former owner  in consideration for i the immediate assignment of the lab s outstanding accounts receivable up through the date of closing  plus ii seven hundred thousand dollars  payable pursuant to the terms of a two year non recourse promissory note secured by all of the assets of the lab 
on november   we entered into a channel agreement with intrexon the initial channel agreement that governs an exclusive channel collaboration arrangement in which we initially intended to use intrexon s technology directed towards the production of pgis  through the use of in vivo conditionally regulated embedded controllable bioreactors for the treatment of pah 
the initial channel agreement establishes committees comprised of our and intrexon representatives that will govern activities related to the pah program in the areas of project establishment  chemistry  manufacturing and controls  clinical and regulatory matters  commercialization efforts and intellectual property 
as consideration for execution of the initial channel agreement  we entered into a stock purchase agreement with intrexon the initial stock purchase agreement pursuant to which we issued to intrexon a number of shares of our common stock equal to of the number of shares of our common stock issued and outstanding following and giving effect to such issuance the first tranche at a purchase price equal to the par value of such shares  which issuance was deemed paid in consideration for the execution and delivery of the initial channel agreement 
we also agreed to issue additional shares of our common stock to intrexon upon dosing of the first patient in a phase ii clinical trial sponsored by us in the us  or similar study as the parties may agree in a country other than the us since our inception in january  our efforts and resources have been focused primarily on acquiring and developing our product candidates  our clinical trials  raising capital and recruiting personnel 
as of june   we emerged from the development stage after entering into a sublicense agreement with meda ab and receiving an up front payment of million 
we consider this sublicense agreement to be an indication that we commenced our principal operations 
to date  we have financed our operations primarily through public and private sales of our common stock  and we expect to continue to seek to obtain the required capital in a similar manner 
we have incurred an accumulated deficit of million through december  we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to achieve profitability on a sustained basis  if at all  obtain the required funding  obtain the required regulatory approvals  or complete additional corporate partnering or acquisition transactions 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  actual results and the timing of the recognition of such amounts could differ from these estimates 
there are accounting policies that we believe are significant to the presentation of our consolidated financial statements 
the most significant accounting policies relate to stock based compensation  revenue recognition and accounts receivable 
stock based compensation calculating stock based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
we apply the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock options 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on historical volatility 
we estimate the expected life of our option using the contractual term of the option 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury zero coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected life of the options 
the dividend rate is based on our historical rate  which we anticipate to remain at zero 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock options represent our best estimates  however these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and different assumptions are used  the stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those stock options expected to vest over the service period 
revenue recognition we record revenue when all of the following have occurred persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service is completed without further obligation  the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize milestone payments or upfront payments that have no contingencies as revenue when payment is received 
our primary streams of revenue are license revenue and laboratory revenue 
license revenues our licensing agreements may contain multiple elements  such as non refundable up front fees  payments related to the achievement of particular milestones and royalties 
fees associated with substantive at risk performance based milestones are recognized as revenue upon completion of the scientific or regulatory event specified in the agreement 
when we have substantive continuing performance obligations under an arrangement  revenue is recognized over the performance period of the obligations using a time based proportional performance approach 
under the time based method  revenue is recognized over the arrangement s estimated performance period based on the elapsed time compared to the total estimated performance period 
revenue recognized at any point in time is limited to the amount of non contingent payments received or due 
when we have no substantive continuing performance obligations under an arrangement  we recognize revenue as the related fees become due 
revenues from royalties on third party sales of licensed technologies are generally recognized in accordance with the contract terms when the royalties can be reliably determined and collectability is reasonably assured 
research and development costs we expense research and development costs associated with developmental products not yet approved by the fda to research and development expense as incurred 
research and development costs consist primarily of license fees including upfront payments  milestone payments  manufacturing costs  salaries  stock based compensation and related personnel costs  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers for laboratory development  legal expenses resulting from intellectual property prosecution and other expenses relating to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our product candidates 
results of operations year ended december  and general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase of is primarily the result of additional employee costs  expanded investor relation activities and outside legal fees related to various securities and exchange commission issues related to berman company pa s failure to follow proper partner rotation procedures 
the charge relating to stock based compensation expense was million for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this increase is due to stock options granted to new executive officers 
the stock based compensation for the year ended december  includes a charge of  relating to the modification of certain stock options  prior to expiration  held by a member of the board of directors 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase of is primarily the result of recording the fair value million of the common stock issued to intrexon as consideration for the exclusive channel collaboration agreement and the fair value million of the common stock issued for the acquisition of the c 
diff program assets of prev abr llc 
these are non cash charges 
the charge relating to share based compensation expense was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  other income expense  net other income was  for the year ended december   compared to other expense of million for the year ended december  other expense for the year ended december   includes million relating to the estimated fair value of the warrants associated with the january and april financings  adjusted for the change in their fair value at december  loss from continuing operations our loss from continuing operations for the year ended december   was million  or per common share  compared to million  or per common share for the year ended december  income loss from discontinued operations our income from discontinued operations was  or per common share for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of  or per common share for the year ended december  on march   we entered into a membership interest purchase agreement  and certain related agreements  pursuant to which we sold all of our interest in the lab to hartlab  llc 
this resulted in the classification of the lab as discontinued operations 
see note discontinued operations of adeona clinical laboratory and note receivable for summarized statement of operations data for the years ended december  and liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through proceeds from equity financings  corporate partnering license fees  laboratory revenues and miscellaneous equipment sales 
on october   we completed a private placement financing of  shares of our common stock  par value of 
per share  at a price per share of 
we raised gross proceeds of million  before estimated offering expenses of  which includes placement agent fees 
in addition to the fee  the placement agent received warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
our cash totaled million at december   an increase of million from december  during the year ended december   the primary sources of cash were net proceeds from the issuances of common stock in a private placement financing of million and stock option exercises of  and warrant exercises of million 
the primary use of cash during the year ended december  was for working capital requirements 
our cash totaled million at december   an increase of million from december  during the year ended december   the primary sources of cash were net proceeds from the issuances of common stock to institutional investors of million and stock option and warrant exercises of  the primary use of cash during the year ended december  was for working capital requirements 
as of march   our cash balance was approximately million 
our continued operations will primarily depend on whether we are able to generate revenues and profits through partnerships  joint ventures and or raise additional funds through various potential sources  such as license fees from a potential corporate partner  equity and debt financing 
such additional funds may not become available on acceptable terms and there can be no assurance that any additional funding that we do obtain will be sufficient to meet our needs in the long term 
we will continue to fund operations from cash on hand and through the similar sources of capital previously described 
we can give no assurances that any additional capital that we are able to obtain will be sufficient to meet our needs 
current and future financing needs we have incurred an accumulated deficit of million through december  with the exception of the quarter ended june   we have incurred negative cash flow from operations since we started our business 
we have spent  and expect to continue to spend  substantial amounts in connection with implementing our business strategy  including our planned product development efforts  our clinical trials  and our research and discovery efforts 
based on our current plans  we believe that our cash will be sufficient to enable us to meet our planned operating needs for at least the next months 
however  the actual amount of funds we will need to operate is subject to many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the following the progress of our research activities  the number and scope of our research programs  the progress of our preclinical and clinical development activities  the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we have entered into research and development agreements  our ability to maintain current research and development licensing arrangements and to establish new research and development and licensing arrangements  our ability to achieve our milestones under licensing arrangements  the costs involved in prosecuting and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  and profitability of our clinical laboratory diagnostic and microbiology services business 
we have based our estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong 
we may need to obtain additional funds sooner or in greater amounts than we currently anticipate 
potential sources of financing include strategic relationships  public or private sales of our shares or debt and other sources 
we may seek to access the public or private equity markets when conditions are favorable due to our long term capital requirements 
we do not have any committed sources of financing at this time  and it is uncertain whether additional funding will be available when we need it on terms that will be acceptable to us  or at all 
if we raise funds by selling additional shares of common stock or other securities convertible into common stock  the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted 
if we are not able to obtain financing when needed  we may be unable to carry out our business plan 
as a result  we may have to significantly limit our operations and our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially harmed
