item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview lattice semiconductor corporation lattice  the company  we  us  or our designs  develops and markets high performance programmable logic products and related software 
programmable logic products are widely used semiconductor components that can be configured by end customers as specific logic circuits  enabling shorter design cycle times and reduced development costs 
our end customers are primarily original equipment manufacturers oems in the communications  industrial and other  consumer and computing end markets 
within the programmable logic market there are two groups of products programmable logic devices pld and field programmable gate arrays fpga each representing a distinct silicon architectural approach 
products based on the two alternative programmable logic architectures are generally optimal for different types of logic functions  although many logic functions can be implemented using either architecture 
we believe that a substantial portion of programmable logic customers utilize both pld and fpga architectures 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company financial condition and results and require management most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
a description of our critical accounting policies follows 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and classification of assets  such as marketable securities  accounts receivable  inventory  auction rate securities  goodwill including the assessment of reporting unit  intangible assets  long lived assets  current and deferred income taxes  accrued liabilities including restructuring charges and bonus arrangements  deferred income and allowances on sales to sell through distributors  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition and deferred income 
we sell our products directly to end customers or through a network of independent manufacturers representatives and indirectly through a network of independent sell in and sell through distributors 
distributors provide us periodic data regarding the product  price  quantity  and end customer when products are resold  as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock 
revenue from sales to original equipment manufacturers oems or sell in distributors is recognized upon shipment 
revenue from sales by our sell through distributors is recognized at the time of reported resale 
under both types of revenue recognition  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured  there are no remaining customer acceptance requirements and no remaining significant performance obligations 
orders from our sell through distributors are initially recorded at published list prices  however  for a majority of our sales  the final selling price is determined at the time of resale and in accordance with a distributor price agreement 
in certain circumstances  we allow sell through distributors to return unsold products 
at times  we protect our sell through distributors against reductions in published list prices 
for these reasons  we do not recognize revenue until products are resold by sell through distributors to an end customer 
for sell through distributors  at the time of shipment to distributors  we a record accounts receivable  net at published list price since there is a legally enforceable obligation from the distributor to pay us currently for product delivered  b relieve inventory for the carrying value of goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributor  and c record deferred revenue and deferred cost of sales in deferred income and allowances on sales to sell through distributors in the liability section of our consolidated balance sheets 
the final price is set at the time of resale and is determined in accordance with a distributor price agreement 
revenue and cost of products sold to sell through distributors are deferred until either the product is resold by the distributor or  in certain cases  return privileges terminate  at which time revenue and cost of products sold are reflected in net loss income 
we must use estimates and apply judgment to reconcile sell through distributors reported inventories to their activities 
errors in our estimates or judgments could result in inaccurate reporting of our revenue  cost of products sold  deferred income and allowances on sales to sell through distributors  and net loss income 
revenue from software licensing was not material for the periods presented 

table of contents fair value of financial instruments 
we invest in various financial instruments including corporate and government bonds  notes  commercial paper and auction rate securities 
we value these instruments at their fair value and monitor our portfolio for impairment on a periodic basis 
in the event that the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  we record an impairment charge and establish a new carrying value 
we assess other than temporary impairment of marketable securities in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc asc  fair value measurements and disclosures 
the framework under the provisions of asc establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value 
each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value 
level instruments generally represent quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 
therefore  determining fair value for level instruments generally does not require significant management judgment  and the estimation is not difficult 
level instruments include inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices for identical instruments in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level instruments include unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
our auction rate securities are classified as level instruments 
management uses a combination of the market and income approach to derive the fair value of auction rate securities  which include third party valuation results  investment broker provided market information and available information on the credit quality of the underlying collateral 
as a result  the determination of fair value for level instruments requires significant management judgment and subjectivity 
our level instruments are classified as long term marketable securities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets and are entirely made up of auction rate securities that consist of student loan asset backed notes 
such loans are insured by the federal government or guaranteed by the federal family educational loan program ffelp 
fair value measurement may be sensitive to various unobservable inputs such as the ability of students to repay their loans  or change in the provision of government guarantees policy toward guaranteeing loan repayment 
if students are unable to pay back their loans or the government changes its policy  our investments may be further impaired 
inventory 
inventories are recorded at the lower of actual cost approximated by standard cost determined on a first in first out basis or market 
we establish provisions for inventory if it is obsolete or we hold quantities which are in excess of projected customer demand 
the creation of such provisions results in a write down of inventory to net realizable value and a charge to cost of sales 
asset impairments 
long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets  are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization 
we monitor the carrying value of our long lived assets for potential impairment and test the recoverability of such assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
these events or changes in circumstances  including management decisions pertaining to such assets  are referred to as impairment indicators 
if an impairment indicator occurs  we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows  we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset group to its carrying value 
fair value is generally determined by considering i internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset group  ii actual third party valuations  and or iii information available regarding the current market for similar asset groups 
if the fair value of the asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset group  an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs and is included in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss income 
estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized  which could impact our ability to accurately assess whether an asset has been impaired 
no impairment charges were recorded for the fiscal year ended valuation of goodwill 
goodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized 
we review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
when evaluating whether goodwill is impaired  the company makes a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
if the qualitative assessment determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the company must measure the impairment loss 
the impairment loss  if any  is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of the 
table of contents goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to purchase price allocation and the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  no further impairment analysis is needed 
for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment  the company operates as a single reporting unit 
no goodwill impairment charges were recorded for the fiscal year ended restructuring charges 
expenses associated with exit or disposal activities are recognized when incurred under asc  exit or disposal cost obligations 
however  because we have a history of paying severance benefits  the cost of severance benefits associated with a restructuring charge is recorded when such costs are probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated in accordance with asc  compensation nonretirement postemployment benefits 
when leased facilities are vacated  an amount equal to the total future lease obligations from the date of vacating the premises through the expiration of the lease  net of estimated sublease income  is recorded as a part of restructuring charges 
accounting for income taxes 
our provision for income tax is comprised of our current tax liability and changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the difference is expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are provided to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that in management s judgment is more likely than not to be recoverable against future taxable income 
at december   us income taxes were not provided on approximately million of the undistributed earnings of our chinese subsidiary 
we intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely 
if these earnings were distributed to the us in the form of dividends or otherwise  we would be subject to additional us income taxes 
our income tax calculations are based on application of the respective us federal  state or foreign tax law 
the company s tax filings  however  are subject to audit by the relevant tax authorities 
accordingly  we recognize tax liabilities based upon our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due when such estimates are more likely than not to be sustained 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
to the extent the final tax liabilities are different than the amounts originally accrued  the increases or decreases are recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we evaluate both positive and negative evidence that may exist and consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
any adjustment to the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income in the period that the adjustment is determined to be required 
stock based compensation 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of substantially all share based awards consistent with the provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation 
option pricing models  including the black scholes model  require the use of input assumptions  including expected volatility  expected term  expected dividend rate  and expected risk free rate of return 
the assumptions for expected volatility and expected term most significantly affect the grant date fair value 
restricted stock unit grants are part of the company equity compensation practices for employees who receive equity grants 
the restricted stock units granted to employees generally vest quarterly over a four year period beginning on the grant date

these declines were partially offset by strength in our new products  principally in the consumer end market led by incremental revenue generated by our ice product line 
revenue increased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to strength in our new products  principally in the consumer end market and a relatively high volume of late product life cycle buys on mainstream and mature products in the industrial and other end market

for fpga products  the strong growth in new product volume  driven by customers migrating from our mainstream and mature products  offset more than one half of the volume declines experienced by certain of our older mainstream and mature products  which were affected by both declines in our military business and the migration to new products 

table of contents pld and fpga revenue for fiscal increased approximately and  respectively  when compared to fiscal in fiscal  pld product volume increased due largely to late product life cycle buys on several low density mature products 
in addition  pld product volume also increased for certain new products in both the consumer and communications end markets 
fpga products in fiscal experienced significant volume increases due largely to communications end market customers migrating to newer technology and late product life cycle buys on mature products  principally in our military business  which is part of our industrial and other end market 
revenue by end market the following end market data is derived from data that is provided to us by our distributors and end customers 
with a diverse base of customers who in some cases manufacture end products spanning multiple end markets  the assignment of revenue to a specific end market requires the use of estimates and judgment 
therefore  actual results may differ from those reported 
the composition of our revenue by end market for fiscal years  and was as follows dollars in thousands year ended change in december  december  january  communications industrial and other consumer computing total revenue the communications market continues to represent our largest end market 
our revenue in this market is largely dependent on a small number of large telecommunications equipment providers  however no individual end customer exceeded of total revenue in   or for fiscal  the communications market revenue declined when compared to fiscal and declined when comparing fiscal to fiscal these declines were driven primarily by macroeconomic weakness which impacted infrastructure investments in the communications market in the second half of fiscal and throughout fiscal for fiscal  the industrial and other market experienced a revenue decline of when compared to fiscal this decline was primarily due to volume declines in our military business 
for fiscal  revenue increased when compared to fiscal this increase is driven by a relatively high volume of late product life cycle buys on certain of our mainstream and mature products 
consumer market revenue increased in both fiscal and fiscal when compared to the respective previous years 
consumer market revenue increased in fiscal due in large part to our ice product  which bolstered our consumer market product offerings 
for  the consumer market revenue increases were driven primarily by volume increase resulting from continued proliferation of more consumer products and a concentrated focus by the company to penetrate this market 
for fiscal  revenue for the computing end market declined when compared to fiscal similar to the communications market  this decline due to reduced volume driven primarily by macroeconomic factors 
for fiscal  computing revenue declined when compared to fiscal

these revenue increases were driven by strong acceptance of certain new consumer product offerings and a general migration of customers to new products from our mainstream and mature products 
revenue for mainstream products decreased in fiscal when compared to fiscal mainstream product revenue declined due primarily to macroeconomic factors affecting the communications and computing end markets as well as reduced volume as customers migrated to newer technology 
revenue for mainstream products decreased in fiscal when compared to fiscal mature product revenue decreased in fiscal when compared to fiscal mature product revenue decreased primarily due to macroeconomic factors  reduced volume as accelerated sales of certain late life cycle products ended and customers migrated to newer technology

in the first fiscal quarter of we reclassified our new  mainstream and mature product categories to better reflect our current product portfolio 

table of contents revenue by geography we assign revenue to geographies based on customer ship to address at the point where revenue is recognized 
in the case of sell in distributors and oem customers  revenue is typically recognized  and geography is assigned  when products are shipped 
in the case of sell through distributors  revenue is recognized when resale to the end customer occurs and geography is assigned based on the end customer location on the resale reports provided by the distributor 
both foreign and domestic sales are denominated in us dollars  with the exception of sales in japan  where sales to certain customers are denominated in yen 
the composition of our revenue by geography  based on ship to location  is as follows dollars in thousands year ended change in december  december  january  asia europe americas total revenue revenue declines in europe and americas in fiscal  compared to fiscal  are due largely to macroeconomic weakness in those regions 
in addition  revenue declined in asia in fiscal  compared fiscal due to relative weakness in the communications end market 
we believe the asia region will remain the primary source of our revenue due to relatively more favorable business conditions in asia and a continuing trend towards the outsourcing of manufacturing by north american and european customers to the asia pacific region 
revenue from foreign sales as a percentage of total revenue were  
and for fiscal   and  respectively 
revenue by distributors our largest customers are distributors and sales through distributors have historically made up a significant portion of our total revenue 
revenue attributable to resales of products by our primary sell through distributors are as follows of total revenue nu horizons electronics corp 
including its parent company  arrow electronics weikeng group avnet  inc all others all sell through distributors no other individual end customer accounted for more than of total revenue in any of the fiscal years  and in fiscal  our global franchise agreement with avnet terminated  however  we had mutually agreed to terms for the transition of inventory through december  revenue from avnet made up approximately of our total revenue for the first nine months of fiscal because we and our remaining global and regional distributors worked directly with our end customers in order to transition the fulfillment of customer orders to replacement distributors  the impact on our business as a result of this change was negligible 
we continue to serve our end customers with a network that includes a global distributor  regional distributors  manufacturer representatives  and our direct sales team 

table of contents gross margin the composition of our gross margin  including as a percentage of revenue  for fiscal years  and was as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  december  january  gross margin percentage of revenue in fiscal  gross margin declined percentage points as compared to fiscal this decline was due primarily to an increase in the percentage of revenue attributable to new products sold into the consumer and communications end markets 
new products typically yield a lower gross margin than our mainstream and mature products 
a net increase to reserves for excess and obsolete inventory slightly reduced fiscal gross margin 
degradation in gross margin due to product and customer mix was partially offset by product cost reductions realized primarily in the second half of the year 
in fiscal  gross margin declined percentage points as compared to fiscal this decline was primarily attributed to an increase in new product revenue which typically carries a lower gross margin than our mainstream and mature products 
sales of fully reserved inventory in fiscal contributed a slight benefit to gross margin 
operating expenses research and development expense the composition of our research and development expenses  including as a percentage of revenue  for fiscal years  and was as follows dollars in thousands year ended change in december  december  january  research and development percentage of revenue research and development expenses include costs for compensation and benefits  development masks  engineering wafers  depreciation and amortization  licenses  and outside engineering services 
these expenditures are for the design of new products  intellectual property cores  processes  quality control  packaging  and software to support new products 
we believe that a continued commitment to research and development is essential to maintain product leadership and provide innovative new product offerings  and therefore we expect to continue to make significant future investments in research and development 
the increase in fiscal  compared to fiscal  was primarily due to increased compensation and benefits due to additional headcount  project based outside engineering services  and depreciation and amortization 
approximately of these increases were offset by reductions in mask costs and variable compensation 
the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily related to increases in compensation and benefits  additional mask costs and project based outside engineering services 

table of contents selling  general  and administrative expense the composition of our selling  general and administrative expenses  including as a percentage of revenue  for fiscal years  and was as follows dollars in thousands year ended change in december  december  january  selling  general and administrative percentage of revenue selling  general  and administrative expenses include costs for compensation and benefits related to selling  general  and administrative employees  commissions  depreciation  professional services  travel and other expenses 
the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to increased severance  stock compensation expense  and legal and professional services 
these increases were partially offset by lower commissions as a result of reduced revenue 
fiscal also had increased costs due to additional headcount associated with the december  acquisition of siliconblue which were entirely offset by reductions in variable compensation 
the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of an increase in compensation and benefits  legal services and professional service costs for marketing and financial consulting 
acquisition related charges  including amortization of intangible assets the composition of our acquisition related charges  including as a percentage of revenue  for fiscal years  and was as follows dollars in thousands year ended change in december  december  january  acquisition related charges  including amortization of intangible assets percentage of revenue acquisition related charges include severance and professional fees directly related to acquisitions  as well as the amortization of the stepped up value of inventory and amortization of identifiable intangible assets with finite useful lives associated with our december  acquisition of siliconblue 
the fiscal charges include million in amortization of intangibles assets 
fiscal also included amortization of the stepped up value of inventory  professional fees  and severance costs 
the charges in fiscal include professional service and legal fees  and amortization of intangible assets 

table of contents restructuring charges the composition of our restructuring charges  including as a percentage of revenue  for fiscal years  and was as follows dollars in thousands year ended change in december  december  january  restructuring charges percentage of revenue on october   our board of directors adopted a restructuring plan 
in connection with this restructuring plan  we reduced our headcount by approximately employees and eliminated certain sites  including our sites in pennsylvania and illinois 
for fiscal  restructuring charges primarily relate to severance and lease termination costs associated with the aforementioned restructuring plan 
we expect to incur additional restructuring charges of million in the first quarter of fiscal  and the restructuring plan is expected to be substantially completed in that quarter 
we also implemented a restructuring plan during fiscal and the resultant restructuring charges approximated million primarily related to severance  offset by approximately million benefit due primarily to the re occupancy of a previously restructured leased facility 
other income  net the composition of our other income  net  including as a percentage of revenue  for fiscal years  and was as follows dollars in thousands year ended change in december  december  january  other income  net percentage of revenue the decrease in other income  net  in fiscal  as compared to fiscal resulted primarily from lower investment income and higher foreign exchange losses in fiscal the increase in fiscal relates to an increase in investment income due to higher invested balances in fiscal when compared to fiscal income taxes the composition of our income taxes for fiscal years  and was as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  december  january  provision benefit for income taxes on december   we began to implement a global tax structure to more effectively align the company corporate structure with the geographic business operations including responsibility for sales and manufacturing activities 
as part of this tax restructuring  we created new and realigned existing legal entities  completed intercompany sales of rights to intellectual property  inventory and fixed assets across different tax jurisdictions  and implemented cost sharing and intellectual property licensing and royalty agreements between our us and foreign entities 
the intercompany sales of rights to intellectual property resulted in a gain for tax purposes  for which we recorded a million tax provision in the fourth quarter of fiscal which was fully offset by the release of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 

table of contents also during the fourth quarter of  we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize the benefit of a portion of our remaining deferred tax assets  resulting in a tax benefit of million 
we based this conclusion on improved operating results over the past two years and our expectations about generating taxable income in the foreseeable future including the implementation of a global tax structure discussed above 
we exercised significant judgment and considered estimates about our ability to generate revenue  gross profits  operating income and taxable income in future periods under our new tax structure in reaching this decision 
the global tax structure was completed during the first quarter of upon the intercompany sale of inventory and fixed assets 
during  we incurred million in tax expense related to on going operations and the completion of the tax structure implementation including the sell through of the inventory portion of this intercompany sale 
we are not currently paying federal income taxes and do not expect to pay such taxes until the benefits of our tax net operating loss and credit carryforwards are fully utilized 
we expect to pay a nominal amount of state income tax 
we accrue interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes 
we are paying foreign income taxes  which are primarily related to the cost of operating offshore research and development  marketing and sales subsidiaries 
the inherent uncertainties related to the geographical distribution and relative level of profitability among various high and low tax jurisdictions make it difficult to estimate the impact of the global tax structure on our future effective tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources the following sections discuss the effect of changes in our balance sheet  as well as the effects of our contractual obligations  other commitments  and the stock repurchase program on our liquidity and capital resources 
we classify our investments as short term based on their nature and availability for use in current operations 
the overall quality of our portfolio is strong  with our cash equivalents and short term investments consisting primarily of high quality  investment grade securities 
our strong cash  cash equivalent and short term investment position allows us to use our cash resources for acquisitions  working capital needs  and repurchases of common stock 
we have historically financed our operating and capital resource requirements through cash flows from operations 
cash provided by operating activities will fluctuate from period to period due to fluctuations in operating results  the timing and collection of accounts receivable  and required inventory levels  among other things 
we believe that our financial resources will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs through the next months 
as of december   we have no long term debt and do not have significant long term commitments for capital expenditures 
in the future  we may consider acquisition opportunities to extend our product or technology portfolios and to expand our product offerings 
in connection with funding capital expenditures  completing acquisitions  securing additional wafer supply  or increasing our working capital  we may seek to obtain debt or equity financing  or advance purchase payments or similar arrangements with wafer manufacturers 
we may also need to obtain debt or equity financing if we experience downturns or cyclical fluctuations in our business that are more severe or longer than anticipated 
liquidity cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term investments dollars in thousands december  december  change cash and cash equivalents short term marketable securities long term marketable securities total cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term marketable securities 
table of contents as of december   we had total cash and cash equivalents of million  of which approximately million was held by our foreign subsidiaries 
we manage our global cash requirements considering i available funds among the subsidiaries through which we conduct business  ii the geographic location of our liquidity needs  and iii the cost to access international cash balances 
the repatriation of non us earnings may have adverse tax consequences as we may be required to pay and record income tax expense on those funds to the extent they were previously considered permanently reinvested 
as of december   we could access all cash held by our foreign subsidiaries without incurring material additional expense 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments of million as compared to december   was primarily the result of cash used for repurchases of common stock of million and capital expenditures of million 
these uses of cash were partially offset by cash provided by operations of million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock pursuant to employee stock compensation plans of million 
at december   long term investments consisted of auction rate securities with par value of million and an estimated fair value of million 
due to continued multiple failed auctions and the resultant illiquidity of these investments  we have classified our investment in auction rate securities as long term 
we intend to sell the auction rate securities as markets for these securities resume or reasonable offers become available 
during  we redeemed auction rate securities at a par value of million and an estimated fair value of million 
accounts receivable  net dollars in thousands december  december  change accounts receivable  net days sales outstanding accounts receivable  net increased million or as of december  compared to december  due primarily to timing of shipments and collections in the last week of each year 
as a result of this increase in accounts receivable  coupled with a decline in revenue  days sales outstanding at december  was days  an increase of days from december  inventories dollars in thousands december  december  change inventories months of inventory on hand inventory increased million or as of december  compared to december  due primarily to a strategic inventory build in the fourth quarter the intent of our strategic inventory build is to both reduce direct material cost and enable timely responsiveness to surges in demand 
as a result  our months of inventory on hand increased from months in to months in share repurchase program during  we repurchased approximately million shares for million under the share repurchase program approved by the board of directors in february this program approved the repurchase of up to million in outstanding stock over a month period 
as of december  approximately million remain available under the stock repurchase program 
all shares repurchased under this program were retired by december  all repurchases under this program have been and will be open market transactions and funded from available working capital 
credit arrangements as of december   we had no long term debt  no significant long term purchase commitments for capital expenditures  and no existing used or unused credit arrangements 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual cash obligations at december  in thousands fiscal year operating leases purchase order obligations thereafter certain of our facilities and equipment are leased under operating leases  which expire at various times through this column excludes amounts already recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as current or long term liabilities at december  we also have other liabilities of million relating to uncertain tax positions 
however  as we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions  we have excluded this amount from the table above 
our significant operating leases are for our facilities in san jose  california  bethlehem  pennsylvania  shanghai  china  downers grove  illinois  and manila  philippines 
our lease in san jose expires in december with annual rental costs estimated to be million 
in january we entered into a month lease of new facilities in san jose  california with annual rental costs estimated at million with annual increases 
we anticipate that we will commence operations at that facility during the second quarter of fiscal our lease in bethlehem expires in september  with annual rental costs estimated to be million with annual increases 
our lease in shanghai expires in may  with remaining rental costs estimated to be million 
our lease in downers grove expires in november  with annual rental costs estimated to be million 
our leases in manila expire in december  april and may  with total annual rental costs estimated to be million with annual increases 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the non cancelable lease term or the estimated useful life of the assets 
we have discontinued operations at our bethlehem  pennsylvania and downers grove  illinois facilities

asu is to be applied prospectively 
asu does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in the financial statements 
asu is effective for us on december  the company does not anticipate that the adoption of this asu will materially change the presentation of its consolidated financial statements

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk credit market risks at december  and december   we held auction rate securities with a par value of million and million  respectively 
at december  and december   the auction rate securities held by us had an estimated fair value of million and million  respectively 
our investments in auction rate securities are subject to interest rate and market risk 
a hypothetical movement in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of the portfolio 
if the market for our investment portfolio declines  our consolidated operating results may be negatively impacted 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we have international subsidiary and branch operations 
in addition  a portion of our silicon wafer and other purchases are denominated in japanese yen and we bill our japanese customers in yen 
we mitigate the resulting foreign currency exchange rate exposure by entering into foreign currency forward exchange contracts for japanese yen 
although such hedges mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate exposure from an economic perspective they were not designated as effective hedges for accounting purposes and are adjusted to fair value through earnings 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
as a result of the use of derivative financial instruments  the company is exposed to the risk that counter parties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations 
to mitigate the counter party credit risk  the company enters into contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors 
on december   the company had a forward contract to deliver  japanese yen on january  the contract settled on that date
