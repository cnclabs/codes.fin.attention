corrections to consolidated financial statements in connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended march   the company determined that it was necessary to correct its consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  as discussed below 
one of the corrections is related to the accounting treatment for dealer discounts 
a dealer discount represents the difference between the amount of a finance receivable  net of unearned interest  based on the terms of a contract with the borrower  and the amount of money the company actually pays the dealer for the contract 
prior to the correction  based on past industry practices  contracts were recorded at the net initial investment with the gross contract balance recorded offset by the dealer discounts which were recorded as an allowance for credit losses for the acquired contracts 
the company determined that this accounting treatment was incorrect as us gaap prohibits carrying over valuation allowances in the initial accounting for acquired loans 
accordingly  the company has now applied an acceptable method under us gaap  deferring and netting dealer discounts against finance receivables as unearned discounts  and recognizing dealer discounts into income as an adjustment to yield over the life of the loan using the interest method 
as a result  the allowance for loan losses is now established solely through charges to earnings through the provision for credit losses 
the company has evaluated the significance of the departure from us gaap to the consolidated financial statements 
under both the former accounting policy and us gaap  the dealer discount remains a reduction of gross finance receivables in arriving at the carrying amount of finance receivables  net 
accordingly  finance receivables continue to be initially recorded at the net initial investment at the time of purchase 
subsequently  the allowance for credit losses is maintained at an amount that reduces the net carrying amount of finance receivables 
the change in this accounting presentation does not result in a change to the net carrying amount of finance receivables or to net income as historical losses incurred  and estimated incurred losses as of the balance sheet date  are generally in excess of the original dealer discount 
the removal of the dealer discount from the allowance requires an equal replacement of provision expense as that portion of the allowance is necessary to absorb probable incurred losses 
this correction also did not have an impact on previously reported assets  liabilities  working capital  equity  earnings  or cash flows 
the second correction related to the accounting treatment and presentation of certain fees charged to dealers and costs incurred in purchasing loans from dealers 
such costs related principally to evaluating borrowers subject to contracts in relation to the company s underwriting guidelines in making a determination to acquire contracts 
prior to the correction  fees charged to dealers were reduced by certain costs incurred to purchase contracts  deferred on a net basis and then amortized into income over the lives of the loans using the interest method 
under us gaap  the fees charged to dealers are considered to be a part of the unearned dealer discount as they are a determinant of the net amount of cash paid to the dealer 
further  us gaap specifies that costs incurred in connection with acquiring purchased loans or committing to purchase loans shall be charged to expense as incurred 
such costs do not qualify as origination costs to be deferred as the contracts have already been originated by the dealers 
the company evaluated the significance of the departure from us gaap to the consolidated financial statements 
after an adjustment to beginning equity and the opening balance of unearned dealer discounts  net of tax  for the initial period presented  there is a limited effect on earnings and no impact on cash flows 
management corrected the errors and retroactively adjusted amounts in all periods presented to ensure the errors would not result in a material difference in future periods 
the changes to the company s consolidated financial statements for fiscal and fiscal resulting from such corrections are set forth in note summary of significant accounting policies corrections to the consolidated financial statements of the company included in
