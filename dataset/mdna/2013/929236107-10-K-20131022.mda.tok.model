changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on sales for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year 
sales of multi purpose maintenance products in the americas segment increased million  or  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year 
this sales increase was driven by higher sales of wd multi purpose maintenance products in the us and latin america  each of which were up year over year 
the sales increase in the us was in part due to a higher overall level of promotional activities for the wd multi use products that were conducted throughout fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase in latin america was primarily due to improved business conditions and a more stable economic environment throughout most of the latin america countries in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year also contributing to the overall sales increase of the multi purpose maintenance products in the americas segment was the sales increase of the wd specialist product line from period to period due to new distribution and product offerings in the us and the launch of this product line in canada and latin america during fiscal year as a result of fluctuations in the promotional patterns with certain of our key customers  particularly those in the mass retail  home center and warehouse club channels in the us  it is common for our sales to vary period over period and year over year 
sales of homecare and cleaning products in the americas segment decreased million  or  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year 
this sales decrease was driven primarily by lower sales of the carpet fresh and spot shot products and the flushes automatic toilet bowl cleaners  which were down  and  respectively  in the us for fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year 
while each of our homecare and cleaning products continue to generate positive cash flows  we have continued to experience decreased sales for these products primarily due to lost distribution  reduced product offerings  competition  category declines and the volatility of orders from and promotional programs with certain of our customers  particularly those in the warehouse club and mass retail channels 
in the second half of fiscal year  management started to evaluate the strategic alternatives for certain of the company s homecare and cleaning products 
to date  no decisions have been made relative to the future strategic plans for these brands 
for the americas segment  of sales came from the us and of sales came from canada and latin america combined for each of the fiscal years ended august  and emea the following table summarizes net sales by product line for the emea segment in thousands  except percentages fiscal year ended august  change from prior year dollars percent multi purpose maintenance products homecare and cleaning products total of consolidated net sales sales in the emea segment  which includes europe  the middle east and africa  increased to million  up million  or  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year had an unfavorable impact on sales 
sales for the fiscal year ended august  translated at the exchange rates in effect for the prior fiscal year would have been million in the emea segment 
thus  on a constant currency basis  sales would have increased by million  or  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year 
the countries in europe where we sell through a direct sales force include the uk  italy  france  iberia which includes spain and portugal and the germanics sales region which includes germany  austria  denmark  switzerland and the netherlands 
overall  sales from direct markets increased million  or  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year 
we experienced sales increases throughout the europe direct markets for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year  with percentage increases in sales as follows the germanics sales region   italy   france   the uk  and iberia  
the sales increase in the direct markets was primarily due to new distribution  continued growth of the base business and the positive impacts of sales price increases which were implemented in certain locations and markets throughout europe during the second and third quarters of fiscal year although sales in the direct markets increased significantly year over year  sales in these markets were negatively impacted throughout fiscal year primarily due to the particularly adverse economic conditions which existed in europe during this time period 
during our fiscal year  the europe economy started to stabilize and this has positively impacted our sales levels  but it is still uncertain whether this stability will continue into future periods 
sales from direct markets accounted for of the emea segment s sales for the fiscal year ended august  compared to of the emea segment s sales for the prior fiscal year 
the regions in the emea segment where we sell through local distributors include the middle east  africa  eastern and northern europe 
sales in the distributor markets increased million  or  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year primarily due to increased sales of wd multi use products and initial sales of the wd specialist product line throughout the distributor markets 
the sales increase from period to period was primarily due to the continued growth of the base business in key markets  particularly those in the middle east and eastern europe 
in general  the markets in which we sell through local distributors have remained more stable in recent years from an economic standpoint than other countries in europe 
the distributor markets accounted for of the total emea segment sales for the fiscal year ended august   compared to for the prior fiscal year 
asia pacific the following table summarizes net sales by product line for the asia pacific segment in thousands  except percentages fiscal year ended august  change from prior year dollars percent multi purpose maintenance products homecare and cleaning products total of consolidated net sales sales in the asia pacific segment  which includes australia  china and other countries in the asia region  increased to million  up million  or  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on sales for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year 
sales in asia  which represented of the total sales in the asia pacific segment  increased million  or  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to the stable economic conditions which existed throughout most of the asia region during fiscal year and increased promotional activities from year to year 
the distributor markets in the asia region experienced a sales increase of million  or  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year  primarily due to the success of certain promotional programs  which were conducted in fiscal year throughout most of the asia countries and the continued growth of the wd multi use products throughout the distributor markets  including those in malaysia  south korea and taiwan 
sales in china increased million  or  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to a higher level of sales which resulted from a significant promotional program that was conducted in the fourth quarter of fiscal year although the overall sales in china increased year over year  china has generally experienced a lower rate of growth for sales over the last several quarters due to adverse economic conditions and the lower level of industrial activities that have existed throughout china in recent periods 
sales in australia slightly decreased by million  or  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to the unfavorable impacts of changes in foreign currency exchange rates from period to period 
on a constant currency basis  sales would have increased million  or  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year 
gross profit gross profit increased to million for the fiscal year ended august  compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to for the fiscal year ended august  compared to for the prior fiscal year 
gross margin was positively impacted by percentage points from period to period due to sales price increases  which were implemented in certain locations and markets throughout most of fiscal year and there was also a decrease in discounts that were given to our customers  which positively impacted gross margin by percentage points year over year 
this decrease in such discounts was due to a lower percentage of sales  particularly those for our homecare and cleaning products in the americas segment  being subject to promotional allowances during the year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year 
advertising  promotional and other discounts that are given to our customers are recorded as a reduction to sales  whereas advertising and sales promotional costs associated with promotional activites that we pay to third parties are recorded as advertising and sales promotional expenses 
in addition  gross margin was positively impacted by percentage points from period to period due to our north american supply chain restructure project 
as a result of this restructure project  we were able to realize lower manufacturing fees from our third party contract manufacturers in fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year 
these decreased costs were partially offset by higher warehousing costs  handling fees and in bound freight costs  all of which are associated with the storage and movement of our product between our third party contract manufacturers and distribution centers  which we incurred during much of fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year 
gross margin was positively impacted by percentage points due to the combined effects of changes in the costs of petroleum based materials and aerosol cans from period to period  the majority of which came from a decrease in costs associated with petroleum based materials 
there is often a delay of one quarter or more before changes in raw material costs impact cost of products sold due to production and inventory life cycles 
we expect that petroleum based material costs will continue to be volatile and that volatility will impact our cost of products sold in future periods 
lower manufacturing costs in our asia pacific segment also positively impacted gross margin by percentage points from period to period 
we incurred higher costs associated with raw materials related to our homecare and cleaning products  as well as increased manufacturing costs in our emea segment  which when combined negatively impacted gross margin by percentage points from period to period 
note that our gross profit and gross margin may not be comparable to those of other consumer product companies  since some of these companies include all costs related to distribution of their products in cost of products sold  whereas we exclude the portion associated with amounts paid to third parties for shipment to our customers from our distribution centers and contract manufacturers and include these costs in selling  general and administrative expenses 
these costs totaled million and million for the fiscal years ended august  and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for the fiscal year ended august  increased million  or  to million from million for the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses increased to for the fiscal year ended august  from for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in sg a expenses was largely attributable to higher employee related costs  a higher level of expenses associated with travel and meetings and increased freight costs 
employee related costs  which include salaries  bonuses  profit sharing  stock based compensation and other fringe benefits  increased million for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year  the majority of which was due to higher bonus expense 
based on our results for fiscal year  we achieved a high level of the profit performance metrics at both the segment level and globally required to trigger payout of bonuses  and as a result  bonus expense and the related fringe benefit expense were significantly higher in fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year 
also contributing to the increase in employee related costs was higher annual compensation increases and increased headcount from period to period 
travel and meeting expenses increased million due to a higher level of travel expenses associated with various sales meetings and activities in support of our strategic initiatives 
freight costs increased million primarily due to higher sales volumes  particularly in the emea segment  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year 
other miscellaneous expenses  which primarily include broker sales commissions  office overhead and bad debt expenses  increased by million period over period 
the increases in sg a expenses described above were slightly offset by a decrease in expenses associated with new product exploration from period to period 
the decrease in new product exploration expenses within research and development of million was primarily due to the increased level of spending in this area during fiscal year related to the development of new product lines within the wd brand  which were launched in fiscal year professional service costs decreased by million and changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased sg a expenses by million for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year 
we continued our research and development investment  the majority of which is associated with our multi purpose maintenance products  in support of our focus on innovation and renovation of our products 
research and development costs for the fiscal years ended august  and were million and million  respectively 
our research and development team engages in consumer research  product development  current product improvement and testing activities 
this team leverages its development capabilities by partnering with a network of outside resources including our current and prospective outsource suppliers 
the level and types of expenses incurred within research and development can vary or offset each other from period to period depending upon the types of activities being performed 
advertising and sales promotion expenses advertising and sales promotion expenses for the fiscal year ended august  decreased million  or  to million from million for the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of net sales  these expenses decreased to for the fiscal year ended august  from for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in advertising and sales promotion expenses was primarily due to lower costs associated with promotional programs conducted in the americas segment  particularly those for our homecare and cleaning products  from period to period 
this decrease was partially offset by a higher level of promotional activities in the emea and asia pacific segments from period to period 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on advertising and sales promotion expenses for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year 
investment in global advertising and sales promotion expenses for fiscal year is expected to be in the range of to of net sales 
as a percentage of net sales  advertising and sales promotion expenses may fluctuate period to period based upon the type of marketing activities we employ and the period in which the costs are incurred 
total promotional costs recorded as a reduction to sales were million and million for the fiscal years ended august  and  respectively 
therefore  our total investment in advertising and sales promotion activities totaled million and million for the fiscal years ended august  and  respectively 
amortization of definite lived intangible assets expense amortization of our definite lived intangible assets remained relatively constant at million and million for the fiscal years ended august  and  respectively 
impairment of definite lived intangible assets expense during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we determined that indicators of impairment existed related to the flushes trade name primarily due to management s most current expectations for future growth and profitability for the flushes trade name 
as a result  we performed a second phase of the impairment test specific to the flushes trade name and concluded that it was impaired by million 
consequently  we recorded a non cash  before tax impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year to reduce the carrying value of the flushes asset to its fair value 
for additional information  refer to the information set forth in note goodwill and other intangible assets 
no such impairments to our long lived assets were identified during fiscal year income from operations by segment the company has updated the financial information previously reported for the business segments to separate out the unallocated corporate expenses

americas income from operations for the americas segment remained relatively constant year over year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit for the americas segment increased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year this increase in the gross margin from period to period was primarily due to the positive impact of sales price increases  a lower level of discounts offered to our customers and the net lower costs associated with the restructure of our north american supply chain  all of which were partially offset by the negative impacts of sales mix changes and higher costs associated with raw materials related to our homecare and cleaning products 
the higher level of sales in the americas segment from period to period was accompanied by a million increase in total operating expenses  the majority of which relates to increased bonus expense from period to period 
operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased from to year over year 
emea income from operations for the emea segment increased to million  up million  or  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year  primarily due to an increase in sales of million and higher gross margin 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit for the emea segment increased from to year over year primarily due to the favorable impacts of sales price increases  sales mix changes within our distributor markets and decreased costs of petroleum based materials in the emea segment  all of which were slightly offset by the unfavorable impact of higher costs associated with raw materials related to our homecare and cleaning products

non operating items the following table summarizes non operating income and expenses for our consolidated operations in thousands fiscal year ended august  change interest income interest expense other income expense  net provision for income taxes interest income interest income increased million for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased cash balances at our uk subsidiary which are being held in higher yielding accounts and short term investments 
interest expense interest expense remained relatively constant for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year 
other income expense  net other income expense  net changed by million for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to net foreign currency exchange gains which were recorded for the fiscal year ended august  compared to net foreign currency exchange losses which were recorded in the prior fiscal year 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was of income before income taxes for the fiscal year ended august  compared to for the prior fiscal year 
this slight decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily driven by increasing foreign earnings generated in lower tax jurisdictions  which were offset by an increase in state taxes

there is often a delay of one quarter or more before changes in raw material costs impact cost of products sold due to production and inventory life cycles 
the majority of this combined negative impact to gross margin from period to period was due to the increase in costs associated with petroleum based material 
in addition  gross margin was negatively impacted by percentage points from period to period due to our north american supply chain restructure project 
as a result of this project  we incurred higher warehousing  handling fees and freight costs  which were all partially offset by lower manufacturing fees from our third party contract manufacturers  during fiscal year compared to fiscal year a large portion of these additional costs resulted from us moving inventory between our various third party contract manufacturers and distribution centers in support of the redesign of our north american supply chain architecture 
the activities related to this redesign project started in the first quarter of fiscal year and included consolidation of our third party contract manufacturers and the restructuring of our distribution center network 
we also incurred higher costs associated with raw materials related to our homecare and cleaning products  as well as increased manufacturing costs in our emea segment  which when combined negatively impacted gross margin by percentage points from period to period 
sales mix changes negatively impacted gross margin by percentage points for the fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year  primarily due to the higher sales mix in the distributor market in our emea segment year over year 
in addition  changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted gross margin by percentage points 
the aforementioned unfavorable impacts to gross margin were significantly offset by the sales price increases  which positively affected gross margin by percentage points for the fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year these sales price increases were implemented in certain locations and markets throughout most of fiscal year and in the second half of fiscal year lower manufacturing costs in our asia pacific segment also positively affected gross margin by percentage points from period to period 
note that our gross profit and gross margin may not be comparable to those of other consumer product companies  since some of these companies include all costs related to distribution of their products in cost of products sold  whereas we exclude the portion associated with amounts paid to third parties for shipment to our customers from our distribution centers and contract manufacturers and include these costs in selling  general and administrative expenses

selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended august  increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal year as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses remained constant at for the fiscal years ended august  and the increase in sg a expenses was largely attributable to higher employee related costs  higher professional services costs and increased freight costs 
employee related costs  which include salaries  bonuses  profit sharing  stock based compensation and other fringe benefits  increased million for the fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year primarily due to annual compensation increases and higher staffing levels in all segments 
this increase in compensation costs was partially offset by lower bonus and stock based compensation expenses from period to period 
although we started to experience some reduction in our freight costs in the third quarter of fiscal year as a result of our north american supply chain restructure  freight costs increased overall by million year over year primarily due to increased diesel costs and reduced truckload sizes as a result of smaller  more frequent orders being placed by our customers during the first half of the fiscal year professional services costs increased million due primarily to higher legal fees 
other miscellaneous expenses  which primarily include broker sales commissions  meeting expenses  office overhead expenses and software support expenses and fees  increased by million period over period 
the increases in sg a expenses described above were partially offset by a decrease in expenses associated with new product exploration from period to period 
the decrease in new product exploration expenses within research and development of million was primarily due to the increased level of spending in this area during fiscal year related to the development of the wd specialist product line  which was launched in the first quarter of fiscal year changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased sg a expenses by million for the fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year we continued our research and development investment  the majority of which is associated with our multi purpose maintenance products  in support of our focus on innovation and renovation of our products 
research and development costs for the fiscal years ended august  and were million and million  respectively 
our research and development team engages in consumer research  product development  current product improvement and testing activities 
this team leverages its development capabilities by partnering with a network of outside resources including our current and prospective outsource suppliers 
the level and types of expenses incurred within research and development can vary or offset each other from period to period depending upon the types of activities being performed 
advertising and sales promotion expenses advertising and sales promotion expenses for the fiscal year ended august  increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal year as a percentage of net sales  these expenses remained constant at for the fiscal years ended august  and the increase in advertising and sales promotion expenses was due to a higher level of advertising and promotional activities period over period  primarily in our asia pacific segment 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on advertising and sales promotion expenses for the fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year as a percentage of net sales  advertising and sales promotion expenses may fluctuate period to period based upon the type of marketing activities we employ and the period in which the costs are incurred 
total promotional costs recorded as a reduction to sales were million and million for the fiscal years ended august  and  respectively 
therefore  our total investment in advertising and sales promotion activities totaled million and million for the fiscal years ended august  and  respectively 
amortization of definite lived intangible assets expense amortization of our definite lived intangible assets was million and million for the fiscal years ended august  and  respectively 
the increase in amortization for the fiscal year ended august  was related to the additional amortization expense of flushes  spot shot and trade names starting march  as these intangible assets were changed to definite lived from indefinite lived intangible assets at february  the amortization for the fiscal year ended august  related only to the carpet fresh and x trade names and certain non contractual customer relationships from the acquisition of the line of products in fiscal year income from operations by segment the company has updated the financial information previously reported for the business segments to separate out the unallocated corporate expenses 
these amounts were included within the americas segment in the company s previously reported business segment information 
the following table summarizes income from operations by segment in thousands  except percentages fiscal year ended august  change from prior year dollars percent americas emea asia pacific unallocated corporate unallocated corporate expenses are general corporate overhead expenses not directly attributable to any one of the operating segments 
these expenses are reported separate from the company s identified segments and are included in selling  general and administrative expenses on the company s consolidated statements of operations 
americas income from operations for the americas segment remained relatively constant year over year 
although sales in the americas segment increased million for the fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year  gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased from to 
this decrease in the gross margin from year to year was primarily due to increased costs of petroleum based materials and higher warehousing and freight costs in connection with our north american supply chain restructure project  which were partially offset by the positive impact of sales price increases year over year 
the higher level of sales for the americas segment from year to year was accompanied by an increase in total operating expenses of million 
operating income as a percentage of net sales remained relatively constant at for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year emea income from operations for the emea segment decreased to million  down million  or  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year  primarily due to a decrease in sales of million 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit for the emea segment decreased slightly to for the fiscal year ended august  compared to for fiscal year although total operating expenses decreased million from year to year  operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased from for the fiscal year ended august  to for the fiscal year ended august asia pacific income from operations for the asia pacific segment increased to million  up million  or  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year the increase in the income from operations for our asia pacific segment was primarily due to an increase in sales of million and an increase in the gross profit as a percentage of net sales from to year over year 
gross margin for the asia pacific segment increased from year to year primarily due to the combined effects of lower manufacturing costs and price increases in the asia pacific region  which were partially offset by increased costs of petroleum based materials 
the higher level of sales for the asia pacific segment from year to year was accompanied by an increase in total operating expenses of million 
as a percentage of net sales  operating income increased from for the fiscal year ended august  to for the fiscal year ended august  non operating items the following table summarizes non operating income and expenses for our consolidated operations in thousands fiscal year ended august  change interest income interest expense other expense income  net provision for income taxes interest income interest income remained relatively constant for the fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year interest expense interest expense decreased million for the fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year due to lower interest rates on the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility as compared to the interest rate on the remaining balance on the term loan 
the final principal payment of million on the term loan was made in october other expense income  net other expense income  net changed by million for the fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year primarily due to net foreign currency exchange losses which were recorded for the fiscal year ended august  compared to net foreign currency exchange gains which were recorded in fiscal year provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was of income before income taxes for the fiscal year ended august  compared to for fiscal year the decrease in the effective income tax rate from period to period was primarily due to a reduction in the state effective tax rate as a result of a recent california tax law change 
the decrease from period to period was also attributable to the benefit from certain foreign earnings generated in lower tax rate jurisdictions  favorable net change in liability for uncertain tax positions and the increased benefit from the deduction for qualified domestic production activities 
net income net income was million  or per common share on a fully diluted basis  for fiscal year compared to million  or per common share on a fully diluted basis  for fiscal year changes in foreign currency exchange rates year over year had an unfavorable impact of million on net income for fiscal year thus  on a constant currency basis  net income for fiscal year would have been million 
performance measures and non gaap reconciliations in managing our business operations and assessing our financial performance  we supplement the information provided by our financial statements with certain non gaap performance measures 
these performance measures are part of our rule  which includes gross margin  cost of doing business  and ebitda  the latter two of which are non gaap performance measures 
cost of doing business is defined as total operating expenses less amortization of definite lived intangible assets  impairment of definite lived intangible assets and depreciation in operating departments and ebitda is defined as net income loss before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we target our gross margin to be at or above of net sales  our cost of doing business to be at or below of net sales  and our ebitda to be at or above of net sales 
although our results for these performance measures may vary from period to period depending on various factors  including economic conditions and our level of investment in activities for the future  we continue to focus on and work towards achievement of our targets over the long term 
the following table summarizes the results of these performance measures fiscal year ended august  gross margin cost of doing business as a percentage of net sales ebitda as a percentage of net sales we use the performance measures above to establish financial goals and to gain an understanding of the comparative performance of the company from period to period 
we believe that these measures provide our shareholders with additional insights into the company s results of operations and how we run our business 
the non gaap financial measures are supplemental in nature and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net income  income from operations or other financial information prepared in accordance with gaap as indicators of the company s performance or operations

net cash provided by operations was million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year we believe we continue to be well positioned to weather any uncertainty in the capital markets and global economy due to our strong balance sheet and efficient business model  along with our growing and diversified global revenues 
we continue to manage all aspects of our business including  but not limited to  monitoring the financial health of our customers  suppliers and other third party relationships  implementing gross margin enhancement strategies and developing new opportunities for growth 
our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash generated from operations and cash available from our existing million revolving credit facility with bank of america  na bank of america 
to date  we have used the proceeds of the revolving credit facility for our stock repurchases and plan to continue using such proceeds for our general working capital needs and stock repurchases under any existing board approved share buy back plans 
during the fiscal year ended august   we borrowed an additional million us dollars under the revolving credit facility 
we regularly convert existing draws on our line of credit to new draws with new maturity dates and interest rates  however the balance on these draws has remained within a short term classification as a result of these conversions 
as of august   we had a million outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility agreement requires us to maintain minimum consolidated earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda of million  measured on a trailing twelve month basis  at each reporting period 
at august   we were in compliance with all debt covenants as required by the revolving credit facility and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future 
we would need to have a significant decrease in sales and or a significant increase in expenses in order for us to not meet the debt covenants 
at august   we had a total of million in cash and cash equivalents 
of this balance  million was held in europe  australia and china in foreign currencies 
it is our intention to indefinitely reinvest all current and future foreign earnings at these locations in order to ensure sufficient working capital  expand operations and fund foreign acquisitions in these locations 
we believe that our future cash from domestic operations together with our access to funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility will provide adequate resources to fund both short term and long term operating requirements  capital expenditures  share repurchases  dividend payments  acquisitions and new business development activities in the united states 
although we hold a significant amount of cash outside of the united states and the draws on the credit facility to date have been made by our entity in the united states  we do not foresee any issues with repaying or refinancing these loans with domestically generated funds since we closely monitor the use of this credit facility 
in the event that management elects for any reason in the future to repatriate some or all of the foreign earnings that were previously deemed to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states  we would incur additional tax expense upon such repatriation 
as of august   we have not provided for us federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on million of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries since these earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states 
we believe that our existing consolidated cash and cash equivalents at august   the liquidity provided by our million revolving credit facility and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected consolidated operating and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we consider various factors when reviewing liquidity needs and plans for available cash on hand including future debt  principal and interest payments  future capital expenditure requirements  future share repurchases  future dividend payments which are determined on a quarterly basis by the company s board of directors  alternative investment opportunities  debt covenants and any other relevant considerations currently facing our business 
cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flows by category for the periods presented in thousands fiscal year ended august  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year this increase from period to period was due to higher net income and changes in operating assets and liabilities  the most significant of which were changes in accrued payroll and related expenses  trade accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
accrued payroll and related expenses increased from period to period primarily due to significantly higher bonus accruals in fiscal year based on our results for fiscal year  we achieved a high level of the profit performance metrics at both the segment level and globally required to trigger payout of bonuses  and as a result  bonus expense and the related fringe benefit expense were significantly higher in fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year 
trade accounts receivable balances increased for fiscal year whereas the balances decreased for fiscal year primarily due to increased sales and the timing of payments received from customers from period to period 
although inventory levels increased during both the fiscal years ended august  and  the increase was much more significant during fiscal year when we started our north american supply chain restructure project 
the significant increase in inventory during fiscal year was primarily attributable to increased purchases of product that we chose to make from our third party contract manufacturers in support of this redesign of our supply chain architecture 
as a result of this new supply chain structure in north america  we carry higher levels of inventory than we have held in periods prior to fiscal year since we are moving product more quickly into our third party distribution centers which is company owned inventory 
inventory balances at august  and included million and million  respectively  of product including raw materials  components and finished products that we are obligated to purchase from one of our third party contract manufacturers  iq products company  in conjunction with the unanticipated termination of our business relationship with them in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and which continues to be the subject of pending litigation 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased from fiscal year to fiscal year primarily due to the increased inventory levels in as a result of the supply chain restructure project  the termination of the business relationship with iq products company in and the timing of payments to suppliers from period to period 
net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year this increase from period to period was due to changes in operating assets and liabilities  the most significant of which were changes in inventories  trade accounts receivable  accrued payroll and related expenses and accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the increase in inventories from period to period was primarily attributable to increased purchases of product that we chose to make from our third party contract manufacturers in support of the redesign of our north american supply chain architecture 
in addition  inventories increased due to million of product including raw materials  components and finished products that we were obligated to purchase from one of our third party contract manufacturers  iq products company  in conjunction with the unanticipated termination of our business relationship with them which is the subject of pending litigation 
trade accounts receivable balances decreased for fiscal year whereas the balances increased for fiscal year primarily due to higher sales volumes in the final months of fiscal year compared to fiscal year and the timing of payments received from customers from period to period 
accrued payroll and related expenses decreased from period to period primarily due to the payment of fiscal year bonuses during the first quarter of fiscal year which were significantly lower than those paid in fiscal year for fiscal year bonuses and lower bonus accruals in fiscal year accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased from period to period primarily due to the increased inventory purchases related to the new supply chain architecture  the termination of the business relationship with iq products company and the timing of payments to suppliers 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased million to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year primarily due to the purchase of million in short term investments that was made by our uk subsidiary during fiscal year and the lower level of proceeds from the sales of property and equipment from period to period 
proceeds from the sales of property and equipment were unusually high for fiscal year due to the sale of our warehouse facility that was located in memphis  tennessee 
these increases were slightly offset by a decrease of million in purchases of property and equipment from period to period 
in addition  there was a million increase in cash provided by investing activities due to an increase in the amount of short term investments maturing in our australia subsidiary year over year 
net cash used for investing activities decreased million to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year due primarily to higher purchases of property and equipment of million  which were more than offset by higher proceeds from the sales of property and equipment of million  the majority of which came from the sale of our warehouse facility located in memphis  tennessee during the first quarter of fiscal year financing activities net cash used in financing activities increased million to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year primarily due to the change in the level of net cash inflows associated with our revolving line of credit and payments made on our debt balances 
in fiscal year  we drew million on our line of credit and we used million of these funds to pay off our term loan and to make repayments on the line of credit 
in fiscal year  we only drew million on the line of credit and made no such repayments of debt 
in addition  there was an million decrease in treasury stock purchases during fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year and a million decrease in the proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options from year to year 
net cash used in financing activities decreased million to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year driven in part by the million in draws that we executed against our revolving credit facility with bank of america during fiscal year this increase in cash was significantly offset by million in repayments made on this revolving credit facility and a million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options from year to year 
in addition  there was a million decrease in treasury stock purchases during fiscal year compared to fiscal year effect of exchange rate changes all of our foreign subsidiaries currently operate in currencies other than the us dollar and a significant portion of our consolidated cash balance is denominated in these foreign currencies  particularly at our uk subsidiary which operates in pound sterling 
as a result  our cash and cash equivalents balances are subject to the effects of the fluctuations in these currencies against the us dollars at the end of each reporting period 
the net effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents  when expressed in us dollar terms  was a decrease in cash of million for fiscal year  a decrease in cash of million for fiscal year and an increase in cash of million for fiscal year these changes from period to period are primarily due to the significant fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates for the pound sterling against the us dollar and lower pound sterling cash and cash equivalent balances from period to period 
the pound sterling to us dollar exchange rate decreased from to during fiscal year  decreased from to during fiscal year and increased from to during fiscal year share repurchase plans on december   the company s board of directors approved a share buy back plan 
under the plan  which was in effect through december   the company was authorized to acquire up to million of its outstanding shares on such terms and conditions as may be acceptable to the company s chief executive officer or chief financial officer and in compliance with all laws and regulations applicable thereto 
during the period from december  through july   the company repurchased  shares at a total cost of million 
as a result  the company has utilized the entire authorized amount and completed the repurchases under this share buy back plan 
on june   the company s board of directors approved a new share buy back plan 
under the plan  which is in effect from august  through august   the company is authorized to acquire up to million of its outstanding shares on such terms and conditions as may be acceptable to the company s chief executive officer or chief financial officer and subject to present loan covenants and in compliance with all laws and regulations applicable thereto 
during the period from august  through august   the company repurchased  shares at a total cost of million 
dividends the company has historically paid regular quarterly cash dividends on its common stock 
in december  the board of directors declared a increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend  increasing it from per share to per share 
on october   the company s board of directors declared a cash dividend of per share payable on october  to shareholders of record on october  our ability to pay dividends could be affected by future business performance  liquidity  capital needs  alternative investment opportunities and loan covenants 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined by item a ii of regulation s k 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our best estimates as to the amounts and timing of minimum contractual payments for our most significant contractual obligations and commitments as of august  for the next five years and thereafter in thousands 
future events could cause actual payments to differ significantly from these amounts 
total year years years thereafter operating leases the following summarizes other commitments which are excluded from the contractual obligations table above as of august  we have ongoing relationships with various suppliers contract manufacturers who manufacture our products 
the contract manufacturers maintain title and control of certain raw materials and components  materials utilized in finished products  and of the finished products themselves until shipment to our customers or third party distribution centers in accordance with agreed upon shipment terms 
although we typically do not have definitive minimum purchase obligations included in the contract terms with our contract manufacturers  when such obligations have been included  they have been immaterial 
in the ordinary course of business  supply needs are communicated by us to our contract manufacturers based on orders and short term projections  ranging from two to five months 
we are committed to purchase the products produced by the contract manufacturers based on the projections provided 
upon the termination of contracts with contract manufacturers  we obtain certain inventory control rights and are obligated to work with the contract manufacturer to sell through all product held by or manufactured by the contract manufacturer on our behalf during the termination notification period 
if any inventory remains at the contract manufacturer at the termination date  we are obligated to purchase such inventory which may include raw materials  components and finished goods 
prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal year  amounts for inventory purchased under termination commitments have been immaterial 
as a result of the unanticipated termination of the iq products company contract manufacturing agreement in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we are currently obligated to purchase million of inventory which is included in inventories in the company s consolidated balance sheet as of august  under the terms of the credit facility agreement with bank of america  we may borrow funds in us dollars or in foreign currencies from time to time during the five year period commencing january  through january  as of august   we had million outstanding on this credit facility 
based on our most recent cash projection and anticipated business activities  we expect to borrow additional amounts against this credit facility ranging from million to million in fiscal year we estimate that the interest associated with these borrowings will be approximately million for fiscal year based on the applicable interest rates and the expected payment dates of such borrowings 
at august   the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions  excluding associated interest and penalties  was approximately million 
we have estimated that up to million of unrecognized tax benefits related to income tax positions may be affected by the resolution of tax examinations or expiring statutes of limitation within the next twelve months 
critical accounting policies our results of operations and financial condition  as reflected in our consolidated financial statements  have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we use historical experience and other relevant factors when developing estimates and assumptions and these estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated 
note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report includes a discussion of the company s significant accounting policies 
the accounting policies discussed below are the ones we consider to be most critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment 
our financial results may have varied from those reported had different assumptions been used or other conditions prevailed 
our critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition and sales incentives sales are recognized as revenue at the time of delivery to our customer when risks of loss and title have passed 
sales are recorded net of allowances for damaged goods and other sales returns  sales incentives  trade promotions and cash discounts 
we must make judgments and certain assumptions in order to determine when delivery has occurred 
through an analysis of end of period shipments  we determine an average time of transit of product to our customers  and this is used to estimate the time of delivery and whether revenue should be recognized during the current reporting period for such shipments 
differences in judgments or estimates related to the lengthening or shortening of the estimated delivery time used could result in material differences in the timing of revenue recognition 
sales incentives are also recorded as a reduction of sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
sales incentives include on going trade promotion programs with customers and consumer coupon programs that require us to estimate and accrue for the expected costs of such programs 
these programs include cooperative marketing programs  shelf price reductions  coupons  rebates  consideration and allowances given to retailers for shelf space and or favorable display positions in their stores and other promotional activities 
costs related to these sales incentive programs  with the exception of coupon costs  are recorded as a reduction to sales upon delivery of products to customers 
coupon costs are based upon historical redemption rates and are recorded as a reduction to sales as incurred  which is when the coupons are circulated 
sales incentives are calculated based primarily on historical rates and consideration of recent promotional activities 
the determination of sales incentive costs and the related liabilities require us to use judgment for estimates that include current and past trade promotion spending patterns  status of trade promotion activities and the interpretation of historical spending trends by customer and category 
we review our assumptions and adjust our reserves accordingly on a quarterly basis 
our consolidated financial statements could be materially impacted if the actual promotion rates are different from the estimated rates 
if our accrual estimates for sales incentives at august  were to differ by  the impact on net sales would be approximately million 
allowance for doubtful accounts the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions related to the collectability of our accounts receivable balances 
we specifically analyze historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and conditions and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we review our accounts receivable balances and our assumptions used to determine their collectability on a periodic basis and adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly on a quarterly basis 
accounting for income taxes current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year 
a deferred income tax liability or asset is established for the expected future tax consequences resulting from the differences in financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is provided if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in addition to valuation allowances  we provide for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement standards prescribed by the authoritative guidance on income taxes 
amounts for uncertain tax positions are adjusted in periods when new information becomes available or when positions are effectively settled 
we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense 
us federal income tax expense is provided on remittances of foreign earnings and on unremitted foreign earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested 
us federal income taxes and foreign withholding taxes are not provided when foreign earnings are indefinitely reinvested 
we determine whether our foreign subsidiaries will invest their undistributed earnings indefinitely based on the capital needs of the foreign subsidiaries 
we reassess this determination each reporting period 
changes to this determination may be warranted based on our experience as well as plans regarding future international operations and expected remittances 
valuation of goodwill the carrying value of goodwill is reviewed for possible impairment in accordance with the authoritative guidance on goodwill  intangibles and other 
we assess for possible impairments to goodwill at least annually during our second fiscal quarter and otherwise when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment condition may exist 
under current authoritative guidance  we are permitted to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
if we conclude based on this qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test and then  if needed  the second step  to determine whether goodwill is impaired 
however  if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is more than its carrying amount  we do not need to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their carrying values  including goodwill 
we determine the fair values of our reporting units using the income valuation approach or other generally accepted valuation methodologies 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  if any  is recognized as an impairment loss 
any impairment losses are recorded as a reduction in the carrying amount of the related asset and charged to results of operations 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we performed a qualitative assessment of each of our reporting units to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
in performing this qualitative assessment  we assessed relevant events and circumstances that may impact the fair value and the carrying amount of each of our reporting units 
factors that were considered included  but were not limited to  the following macroeconomic conditions  industry and market conditions  overall financial performance and expected financial performance  other entity specific events  such as changes in management or key personnel  and events affecting the company s reporting units  such as a change in the composition of net assets or any expected dispositions 
based on the results of this qualitative assessment  we determined that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of each of our reporting units is less than its fair value and  thus  the two step quantitative analysis was not required 
as a result  we concluded that no impairment of our goodwill existed as of february  we also did not identify or record any impairment losses related to our goodwill during our annual impairment tests performed in fiscal years and in addition  there were no indicators of impairment identified as a result of our review of events and circumstances related to our goodwill subsequent to february  impairment of definite lived intangible assets we assess for potential impairments to our long lived assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable and or its remaining useful life may no longer be appropriate 
any required impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the asset s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  which is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing market participants and would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying amount of the related asset and a charge to results of operations 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the expected future undiscounted net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
in april  we determined based on our review of events and circumstances that there were indicators that the carrying values of our flushes  spot shot  carpet fresh and x definite lived trade name intangible assets may not be fully recoverable 
the specific event which existed for each of the trade names was related to management s evaluation work which it started in late april and was an outcome of discussions with the board of directors in march to explore the strategic alternatives for these homecare and cleaning products in the americas segment 
as a result of this work being performed by management starting in late april  it was determined that there was a likelihood of more than that these trade names in certain locations will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of their previously estimated useful lives 
as a result  management performed the step recoverability test under accounting standards codification  impairment or disposal of long lived assets  for each of these trade names 
in performing the step recoverability test  we compared the carrying value of each asset group  which was determined to be at the trade name level  to the total of the undiscounted cash flows expected to be received over the remaining useful life of each trade name asset group 
based on the results of this recoverability test  we determined that the total of the undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value for each of these asset groups and that no impairment existed for any of these trade names as of may  in addition  in conjunction with performing this recoverability analysis  we also performed an evaluation of the remaining useful life for each of these trade names to determine if they were still appropriate as of may  based on the results of this evaluation  we also determined that it was appropriate to reduce the remaining useful life of the flushes trade name from fourteen years and ten months to seven years effective on may  consequently  we began to amortize this trade name on a straight line basis over its new remaining useful life effective on may  we determined that no reduction of the remaining useful lives for the spot shot  carpet fresh  x and trade names were warranted as a result of this evaluation 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  as part of management s ongoing evaluation of potential strategic alternatives for certain of the company s homecare and cleaning products  we further determined based on our review of events and circumstances that there were indicators of impairment for the carpet fresh and flushes trade names 
management accordingly performed the step recoverability test for these two trade names and based on the results of this analysis  it was determined that the total of the undiscounted cash flows significantly exceeded the carrying value for the carpet fresh asset group and that no impairment existed for this trade name as of august  however  the step analysis indicated that the carrying value of the asset group for the flushes exceeded its undiscounted future cash flows  and consequently  a second phase of the impairment test step was performed specific to the flushes trade name to determine whether this trade name is impaired 
the flushes trade name failed step in the fourth quarter analysis primarily driven by changes in management s current expectations for future growth and profitability for the flushes trade name as compared to those used in the previous step analysis 
in performing the step analysis  we determined the fair value of the asset group utilizing the income approach  which is based on the present value of the estimated future cash flows 
the calculation that is prepared in order to determine the estimated fair value of an asset group requires management to make assumptions about key inputs in the estimated cash flows  including long term forecasts  discount rates and terminal growth rates 
in estimating the fair value of the flushes trade name  the company applied a discount rate of  annual revenue growth rates ranging from negative to positive and a long term terminal growth rate of 
cash flow projections used were based on management s estimates of revenue growth rates  contribution margins and earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the discount rate used was based on the weighted average cost of capital 
we also considered the fair value concepts of a market participant and thus all amounts included in the long term forecast reflect management s best estimate of what a market participant could realize over the projection period 
after taking all of these factors into consideration  the estimated fair value of the asset group was then compared to the carrying value of the flushes trade name asset group to determine the amount of the impairment 
based on the results of this step analysis  the flushes asset group s estimated fair value was determined to be lower than its carrying value 
consequently  we recorded a non cash  before tax impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year to reduce the carrying value of the flushes asset to its fair value of million 
an intangible asset valuation is dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions  including macroeconomic conditions  overall category growth rates  sales growth rates  cost containment and margin expansion and expense levels for advertising and promotions and general overhead  all of which must be developed from a market participant standpoint

if the results of these future analyses are lower than current estimates  an additional impairment charge may result at that time
