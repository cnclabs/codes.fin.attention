our historical financial statements for    and  have been retrospectively updated to reflect the effects on financial position  cash flows and results of operations attributable to the activities of the redbird class a interests and the blending and packaging assets as if we owned these assets for these periods 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a publicly traded limited partnership with a diverse set of operations focused primarily in the us gulf coast region 
our four primary business lines include terminalling and storage services for petroleum and by products  natural gas services  sulfur and sulfur based products gathering  processing  marketing  manufacturing and distribution  and marine transportation services for petroleum products and by products 
the petroleum products and by products we collect  transport  store and market are produced primarily by major and independent oil and gas companies who often turn to third parties  such as us  for the transportation and disposition of these products 
in addition to these major and independent oil and gas companies  our primary customers include independent refiners  large chemical companies  fertilizer manufacturers and other wholesale purchasers of these products 
we operate primarily in the gulf coast region of the us this region is a major hub for petroleum refining  natural gas gathering and processing and support services for the exploration and production industry 
we were formed in by martin resource management  a privately held company whose initial predecessor was incorporated in as a supplier of products and services to drilling rig contractors 
since then  martin resource management has expanded its operations through acquisitions and internal expansion initiatives as its management identified and capitalized on the needs of producers and purchasers of petroleum products and by products and other bulk liquids 
as of december   martin resource management owned of our total outstanding common limited partner units and a general partnership interest in us and all of our incentive distribution rights 
martin resource management has operated our business since martin resource management began operating our natural gas services business in the s and our sulfur business in the s 
it began our marine transportation business in the late s 
it entered into our fertilizer and terminalling and storage businesses in the early s 
in recent years  martin resource management has increased the size of our asset base through expansions and strategic acquisitions 
recent developments we believe one of the rationales driving investment in master limited partnerships  including us  is the opportunity for distribution growth offered by the partnerships 
such distribution growth is a function of having access to liquidity in the financial markets used for incremental capital investment development projects and acquisitions to grow distributable cash flow 
we continually adjust our business strategy to focus on maximizing liquidity  maintaining a stable asset base which generates fee based revenues not sensitive to commodity prices  and improving profitability by increasing asset utilization and controlling costs 
over the past year  we have had access to the capital markets and have appropriate levels of liquidity and operating cash flows to adequately fund our growth 
over the next two years  we plan to increase growth capital expenditures primarily in our terminalling and storage and natural gas services segments 
during the past year  we continued to experience positive market dynamics in our terminalling and storage segment 
this is in large part to the rapid development of the eagle ford shale basin in south texas and its need for off take infrastructure 
in addition  we purchased certain specialty lubricant blending and packaging assets as further integration into our existing assets 
we also purchased all remaining class a interests in redbird 
redbird was formerly a joint venture between us and martin resource management formed in to invest in cardinal  a joint venture between martin resource management and energy capital partners ecp that is focused on the development  construction  operation and management of natural gas storage facilities in northern louisiana and mississippi 
as a result of this transaction  redbird is now a wholly owned subsidiary of us 
we believe natural gas storage assets are ideally suited for the master limited partnership structure

for a more detailed discussion regarding our credit facility  see description of our long term debt credit facility within this item 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on the historical consolidated and condensed financial statements included elsewhere herein 
we prepared these financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements required us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our results may differ from these estimates 
currently  we believe that our accounting policies do not require us to make estimates using assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain 
however  we have described below the critical accounting policies that we believe could impact our consolidated and condensed financial statements most significantly 
you should also read note  significant accounting policies in notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
some of the more significant estimates in these financial statements include the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and the determination of the fair value of our reporting units as it relates to our annual goodwill evaluation 
derivatives all derivatives and hedging instruments are included on the balance sheet as an asset or liability measured at fair value and changes in fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
if a derivative qualifies for hedge accounting  changes in the fair value can be offset against the change in the fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until such time as the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
our hedging policy allows us to use hedge accounting for financial transactions that are designated as hedges 
derivative instruments not designated as hedges or hedges that become ineffective are being marked to market with all market value adjustments being recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
product exchanges we enter into product exchange agreements with third parties whereby we agree to exchange ngls and sulfur with third parties 
we record the balance of exchange products due to other companies under these agreements at quoted market product prices and the balance of exchange products due from other companies at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
product exchanges with the same counterparty are entered into in contemplation of one another and are combined 
the net amount related to location differentials is reported in product sales or cost of products sold on the consolidated statement of operations 
revenue recognition revenue for our four operating segments is recognized as follows terminalling and storage revenue is recognized for storage contracts based on the contracted monthly tank fixed fee 
for throughput contracts  revenue is recognized based on the volume moved through our terminals at the contracted rate 
for our tolling agreement  revenue is recognized based on the contracted monthly reservation fee and throughput volumes moved through the facility 
when lubricants and drilling fluids are sold by truck or rail  revenue is recognized upon delivering product to the customers as title to the product transfers when the customer physically receives the product 
natural gas services ngl distribution revenue is recognized when product is delivered by truck to our ngl customers  which occurs when the customer physically receives the product 
when product is sold in storage  or by pipeline  we recognize ngl distribution revenue when the customer receives the product from either the storage facility or pipeline 
sulfur services revenue from sulfur product sales is recognized when the customer takes title to the product at our plant or the customer facility 
revenues from sulfur services is recognized as deliveries are made during each monthly period 
marine transportation revenue is recognized for time charters based on a per day rate 
for contracted trips  revenue is recognized upon completion of the particular trip 
equity method investments we use the equity method of accounting for investments in unconsolidated entities where the ability to exercise significant influence over such entities exists 
investments in unconsolidated entities consist of capital contributions and advances plus the our share of accumulated earnings as of the entities latest fiscal year ends  less capital withdrawals and distributions 
investments in excess of the underlying net assets of equity method investees  specifically identifiable to property  plant and equipment  are amortized over the useful life of the related assets 
excess investment representing equity method goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment  annually 
under certain provisions of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  related to goodwill  this goodwill is not subject to amortization and is accounted for as a component of the investment 
equity method investments are subject to impairment under the provisions of asc  which relates to the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
no portion of the net income from these entities is included in our operating income 
we own of the class a and class b equity interests in redbird 
redbird  as of december  and  owned a and interest in cardinal  respectively 
we own an unconsolidated interest in caliber gathering  llc caliber 
goodwill goodwill is subject to a fair value based impairment test on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment 
we are required to identify our reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets 
we are required to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  we would be required to perform the second step of the impairment test  as this is an indication that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired 
all four of our reporting units  terminalling and storage  natural gas services  sulfur services and marine transportation  contain goodwill 
we have historically performed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of september of each year 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we changed the annual impairment testing date from september to august we believe this change  which represents a change in the method of applying an accounting principle  is preferable in the circumstances as the earlier date provides additional time prior to our quarter end to complete the goodwill impairment testing and report the results in our quarterly report on form q 
we have performed the annual impairment tests as of august   august   and september   and we have determined fair value in each reporting unit based on the weighted average of three valuation techniques i the discounted cash flow method  ii the guideline public company method  and iii the guideline transaction method 
at august   august   and september   the estimated fair value of each of our four reporting units was in excess of its carrying value  resulting in no impairment 
no triggering events occurred that would cause us to perform an impairment test at either december  or significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit which could give rise to future impairment 
changes to these estimates and assumptions can include  but may not be limited to  varying commodity prices  volume changes and operating costs due to market conditions and or alternative providers of services 
environmental liabilities and litigation we have not historically experienced circumstances requiring us to account for environmental remediation obligations 
if such circumstances arise  we would estimate remediation obligations utilizing a remediation feasibility study and any other related environmental studies that we may elect to perform 
we would record changes to our estimated environmental liability as circumstances change or events occur  such as the issuance of revised orders by governmental bodies or court or other judicial orders and our evaluation of the likelihood and amount of the related eventual liability 
because the outcomes of both contingent liabilities and litigation are difficult to predict  when accounting for these situations  significant management judgment is required 
amounts paid for contingent liabilities and litigation have not had a materially adverse effect on our operations or financial condition  and we do not anticipate they will in the future 
allowance for doubtful accounts in evaluating the collectability of our accounts receivable  we assess a number of factors  including a specific customer ability to meet its financial obligations to us  the length of time the receivable has been past due and historical collection experience 
based on these assessments  we record specific and general reserves for bad debts to reduce the related receivables to the amount we ultimately expect to collect from customers 
our management closely monitors potentially uncollectible accounts 
estimates of uncollectible amounts are revised each period  and changes are recorded in the period they become known 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer creditworthiness or actual defaults are higher than the historical experience  management estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could potentially be adversely affected 
these charges have not had a materially adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 
asset retirement obligations we recognize and measure our asset and conditional asset retirement obligations and the associated asset retirement cost upon acquisition of the related asset and based upon the estimate of the cost to settle the obligation at its anticipated future date 
the obligation is accreted to its estimated future value and the asset retirement cost is depreciated over the estimated life of the asset 
estimates of future asset retirement obligations include significant management judgment and are based on projected future retirement costs 
such costs could differ significantly when they are incurred 
revisions to estimated asset retirement obligations can result from changes in retirement cost estimates due to surface repair  and labor and material costs  revisions to estimated inflation rates and changes in the estimated timing of abandonment 
for example  we do not have access to natural gas reserve information related to our gathering systems to estimate when abandonment will occur

in addition to the direct expenses  under the omnibus agreement  we are required to reimburse martin resource management for indirect general and administrative and corporate overhead expenses

the credit facility requires mandatory prepayments of amounts outstanding thereunder with the net proceeds of certain asset sales  equity issuances and debt incurrences 
we used the proceeds from our disposition of the prism assets to pay down outstanding indebtedness 
indebtedness under the credit facility bears interest  at our option  at the eurodollar rate the british bankers association libor rate plus an applicable margin or the base rate the highest of the federal funds rate plus  the day eurodollar rate plus  or the administrative agent s prime rate plus an applicable margin 
we pay a per annum fee on all letters of credit issued under the credit facility  and we pay a commitment fee which ranges from to per annum on the unused revolving credit availability under the credit facility

the credit facility also contains certain default provisions relating to martin resource management 
if martin resource management no longer controls our general partner  or if ruben martin is not the chief executive officer of our general partner and a successor acceptable to the administrative agent and lenders providing more than of the commitments under our credit facility is not appointed  the lenders under our credit facility may declare all amounts outstanding thereunder immediately due and payable 
in addition  either a bankruptcy event with respect to martin resource management or a judgment with respect to martin resource management could independently result in an event of default under our credit facility if it is deemed to have a material adverse effect on us 
if an event of default relating to bankruptcy or other insolvency events occurs with respect to us or any of our subsidiaries  all indebtedness under our credit facility will immediately become due and payable 
if any other event of default exists under our credit facility  the lenders may terminate their commitments to lend us money  accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness outstanding under the credit facility and exercise other rights and remedies 
in addition  if any event of default exists under our credit facility  the lenders may commence foreclosure or other actions against the collateral 
any event of default and corresponding acceleration of outstanding balances under our credit facility could require us to refinance such indebtedness on unfavorable terms and would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as well as our ability to make distributions to unitholders 
if any default occurs under our credit facility  or if we are unable to make any of the representations and warranties in the credit facility  we will be unable to borrow funds or have letters of credit issued under our credit facility 
as of march   our outstanding indebtedness includes million under our credit facility 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our credit facility and may enter into interest rate swaps to reduce this risk 
effective september  we entered into an interest rate swap that swapped million of fixed rate to floating rate 
the floating rate cost is the applicable three month libor rate 
this interest rate swap was not accounted for using hedge accounting 
this swap was scheduled to mature in april  but was terminated in august effective september  we entered into an interest rate swap that swapped million of fixed rate to floating rate 
the floating rate cost is the applicable three month libor rate 
this interest rate swap was not accounted for using hedge accounting 
this swap was scheduled to mature in april  but was terminated in august subsequent event senior unsecured notes issuance on february   we completed a private placement of million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due to qualified institutional buyers under rule a 
we received proceeds of approximately million  after deducting initial purchasers discounts and the expenses of the private placement 
the proceeds were primarily used to repay borrowings under the partnership revolving credit facility 
seasonality a substantial portion of our revenues are dependent on sales prices of products  particularly ngls and fertilizers  which fluctuate in part based on winter and spring weather conditions 
the demand for ngls is strongest during the winter heating season and the refinery blending season 
the demand for fertilizers is strongest during the early spring planting season 
however  our terminalling and storage and marine transportation segments and the molten sulfur business are typically not impacted by seasonal fluctuations 
we expect to derive a majority of our net income from our terminalling and storage  sulfur and marine transportation businesses 
therefore  we do not expect that our overall net income will be impacted by seasonality factors 
however  extraordinary weather events  such as hurricanes  have in the past  and could in the future  impact our terminalling and storage and marine transportation segments 
impact of inflation inflation did not have a material impact on our results of operations in  or although the impact of inflation has been insignificant in recent years  it is still a factor in the us economy and may increase the cost to acquire or replace property  plant and equipment 
it may also increase the costs of labor and supplies 
in the future  increasing energy prices could adversely affect our results of operations 
diesel fuel  natural gas  chemicals and other supplies are recorded in operating expenses 
an increase in price of these products would increase our operating expenses which could adversely affect net income 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to pass along increased operating expenses to our customers 
environmental matters our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations adopted by various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which these operations are conducted 
we incurred no material environmental costs  liabilities or expenditures to mitigate or eliminate environmental contamination during  or item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our credit facility  which had a weighted average interest rate of as of december  as of march   we had total indebtedness outstanding under our credit facility of million  all of which was unhedged floating rate debt
