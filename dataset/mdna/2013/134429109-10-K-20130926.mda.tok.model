significant accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies 
the following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments  estimates and assumptions trade and consumer promotion programs the company offers various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers  such as feature price discounts  in store display incentives  cooperative advertising programs  new product introduction fees  and coupons 
the mix between promotion programs  which are classified as reductions in revenue  and advertising or other marketing activities  which are classified as marketing and selling expenses  fluctuates between periods based on the company s overall marketing plans  and such fluctuations have an impact on revenues 
the measurement and recognition of the costs for trade and consumer promotion programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates 
estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors 
typically  programs that are offered have a very short duration 
historically  the difference between actual experience compared to estimated redemptions and performance has not been significant to the quarterly or annual financial statements 
however  actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance were to vary from estimates 
valuation of long lived assets fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if an impairment exists 
if an impairment is determined to exist  the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually for impairment  or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that more likely than not the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment 
goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a two step quantitative test 
the qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the company may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a two step quantitative impairment test 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses 
the discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates  operating margins  weighted average cost of capital  and future economic and market conditions 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value  goodwill is considered impaired 
the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value  which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a business combination 
indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates  weighted average cost of capital  and assumed royalty rates 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  the asset is reduced to fair value 
in the fourth quarter of  as part of the company annual review of intangible assets  an impairment charge of million was recorded on goodwill and million on trademarks for the simple meals business in europe 
the impairment was attributable to a combination of factors  including the existence of a firm offer to purchase the business  a revised future outlook for the business  with reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows  given the economic uncertainty in the region  future investments required to maintain performance  and management assumptions on the weighted average cost of capital 
on august   the company announced that it was in final and exclusive negotiations for the potential sale of this business 
the company has reflected the results of the business as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings for all years presented 
the business was historically included in the international simple meals and beverages segment 
the assets and liabilities have been reflected in assets and liabilities held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet as of july  as of july   the carrying value of goodwill was billion  of which million relates to the european simple meals business and has been included in assets held for sale 
prior to the impairment charge in  the company had not recognized any impairment of goodwill as a result of annual testing  which began in as of the measurement  the estimated fair value of each reporting unit of continuing operations exceeded the carrying value by at least  excluding the acquisitions 
holding all other assumptions used in the fair value measurement constant  a basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital would not result in the carrying value of any reporting unit to be in excess of the fair value 
as of july   goodwill related to the acquisition of bolthouse farms and plum was million and million  respectively 
within bolthouse  the fair value exceeded the carrying value by at least 
because the plum acquisition closed on june   the carrying value represents fair value 
as of july   the carrying value of trademarks was million  of which million relates to the european simple meals business and has been included in assets held for sale 
holding all other assumptions used in the measurement constant  a basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital would reduce the fair value of trademarks of continuing operations  excluding the acquisitions  but would not result in an impairment charge 
as of july   trademarks related to the acquisition of bolthouse farms and plum were million and million  respectively 
in  as part of the company s annual review of intangible assets  an impairment charge of million was recognized related to a trademark used in the european simple meals business  formerly included in the international simple meals and beverages segment 
the trademark was determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brand  resulting from reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows in comparison to the prior year 
the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance  economic conditions  market conditions  and cost of capital 
inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond the company s control  such as capital markets 
the actual cash flows could differ materially from management s estimates due to changes in business conditions  operating performance  and economic conditions 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets 
pension and postretirement benefits the company provides certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees 
determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions  including discount rates  expected return on plan assets  compensation increases  turnover rates and health care trend rates 
independent actuaries  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  perform the required calculations to determine expense 
actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods 
the discount rate is established as of the company s fiscal year end measurement date 
in establishing the discount rate  the company reviews published market indices of high quality debt securities  adjusted as appropriate for duration 
in addition  independent actuaries apply high quality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans 
the expected return on plan assets is a long term assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance  considering the company s current and projected investment mix 
this estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation  long term projected real returns for each asset class  and a premium for active management 
within any given fiscal period  significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets 
the value of plan assets  used in the calculation of pension expense  is determined on a calculated method that recognizes of the difference between the actual fair value of assets and the expected calculated method 
gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date 
if the net gain or loss exceeds of the greater of plan assets or liabilities  a portion is amortized into earnings in the following year 
net periodic pension and postretirement expense was million in  million in  and million in significant weighted average assumptions as of the end of the year were as follows pension discount rate for benefit obligations expected return on plan assets postretirement discount rate for obligations initial health care trend rate ultimate health care trend rate estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are as follows a basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately million  a basis point reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately million 
a one percentage point increase in assumed health care costs would increase postretirement service and interest cost by approximately million 
net periodic pension and postretirement expense is expected to decrease to approximately million in primarily due to decreased amortization of unrecognized losses as a result of an increase in the discount rate 
the company contributed million  million  and million  respectively  to us pension plans in   and contributions to non us plans were million in  million in  and million in the company contributed million to us plans in the first quarter of additional contributions to us plans are not expected in contributions to us plans are expected to be approximately million in see also note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on pension and postretirement expenses 
income taxes the effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates  tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates and management s estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues 
significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions 
income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized
