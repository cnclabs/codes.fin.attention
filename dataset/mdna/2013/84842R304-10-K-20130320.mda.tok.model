item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations restatement as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements  the consolidated financial statements presented here have been restated to give effect to correction of a misstatement in the classification of the company s outstanding warrants 
on february   company management  in consultation with its audit committee  revised its prior position on accounting for warrants and concluded that its previously issued consolidated financial statements for all periods since mid november collectively  the affected periods should not be relied on because of a misapplication in the guidance on accounting for warrants as defined below 
however  the non cash adjustments to the financial statements  in all of the affected periods  do not impact the amounts previously reported for the company s cash and cash equivalents  total assets  revenue  or cash flows 
the warrants at issue collectively  the warrants include i warrants to purchase an aggregate of  and shares of the company s common stock  issued in november at an exercise price of and per share  respectively  ii warrants to purchase an aggregate of  and shares of the company s common stock  issued in october at an exercise price of and per share  respectively  iii warrants to purchase an aggregate of  and shares of the company s common stock  issued in january at an exercise price of and per share  respectively  iv warrants to purchase an aggregate of  and shares of the company s common stock  issued in october at an exercise price of and per share  respectively  v warrants to purchase an aggregate of  and  shares of the company s common stock  issued in february at an exercise price of and per share  respectively  and vi warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock  issued in november at an exercise price of per share  the above warrant shares and exercise prices have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the and reverse stock splits 
historically  the warrants were reflected as a component of equity as opposed to liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated statements of operations did not include the subsequent non cash changes in estimated fair value of the warrants in accordance with accounting standards codification  derivatives and hedging asc 
the warrant agreements contain a provision for net cash settlement at the option of the holder in the event that there is a fundamental transaction as contractually defined in the warrant agreements 
the company had previously conducted in depth analysis in prior years of its other warrants and concluded that all fundamental transactions were within the control of the company and thus equity treatment for the warrants was appropriate 
however  new insight on derivatives  obtained by the company during the process of analyzing the accounting guidance for the november warrants  prompted the company to re assess its prior position 
under the guidance of acs  warrant instruments that could potentially require net cash settlement in the absence of express language precluding such settlement  should be initially classified as derivative liabilities as their estimated fair values  regardless of the likelihood that such instruments will ever be settled in cash 
in periods subsequent to issuance  changes in the estimated fair value of the derivative instruments should be reported in the statement of operations 
the audit committee  together with management  determined that the financial statements in the affected periods should be restated to reflect the warrants as liabilities  with subsequent changes in their estimated fair value recorded as non cash income or expense in each affected period 
the company has restated its audited consolidated financial statements for the year ending december  and the related disclosures 
the company has not amended its previously filed annual reports on form k for the years ended december  and or its quarterly reports on form q for the periods march   june   and september  to correct these misstatements 
in addition to the restatement noted above  the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  and the consolidated balance sheets then ended have also been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the company s september reverse stock splits  and for the discontinued operations as discussed in note summary of significant accounting policies nature of business and basis of presentation 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations incorporates the restated amounts 
for this reason  the information set forth in this section may not be comparable to discussion and information in our previously filed annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  overview the company previously operated via two principal segments  biospherics and health sciences through december  biospherics seeks to develop proprietary products for commercial application 
health sciences provided technical and regulatory consulting services to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  as well as provided technical support for the biospherics segment 
during the periods covered by this report  the company had two wholly owned subsidiaries  biospherics incorporated and spherix consulting  inc  for its two operating segments 
the company provides management  strategic guidance  business development  marketing and other services to its subsidiaries 
the operations of spherix consulting  inc have been retroactively adjusted as discontinued operations as a result of the december  sale of the subsidiary as more fully described below 
on september   the company effected a reverse stock split of its outstanding common stock at an exchange ratio of for the reverse stock split reduced the december  and number of outstanding shares of common stock from  and  shares to  and  shares  respectively 
following the reverse stock split  the company regained compliance with nasdaq s minimum bid price rule 
in november  following completion of a private placement offering  the company expanded its board of directors from six to seven members 
the expanded board undertook a review of the company s cash balances and capital requirements for its drug development and consulting segments 
the company concluded that the prospect of raising the significant amount of capital needed to successfully advance its drug development opportunities  which were in an early stage of development  would not be available to it in the foreseeable future given the state of the capital markets  making it unlikely that the company could continue to support its drug development and consulting businesses 
the company s board of directors in reviewing its options determined to undertake a major re examination of its business strategies and to explore strategic alternatives 
immediate action was taken to reduce expenses  and the decision was made to terminating the employment contracts of employees of the consulting business  and to either cease the consulting business or dispose of it for nominal consideration 
further the board was reduced to four members 
to facilitate any transition to a new business and continue to satisfy our other responsibilities  retention agreements were entered into with dr 
lodder as president  mr 
clayton as chief financial officer  treasurer and corporate secretary  and ms 
barton as executive assistant 
the company s review and evaluation of its existing business is continuing and this effort may result in the further divestiture or winding down of our historic businesses and the possible entry into a new  yet identified business  including via acquisitions 
in mid november   the board of directors and the holders of approximately of our common stock approved the following actions  which became effective on december  an increase in our authorized capital stock to  shares of common stock  par value per share  and  shares of preferred stock  par value per share  the adoption of the spherix incorporated equity incentive plan  pursuant to which up to  shares of common stock may be issued to employees  officers and directors via stock options and grants of restricted stock  and approval of the issuance of up to  shares of our common stock pursuant to the exercise of our series b warrants issued in our november private placement transaction 
on december   the company sold all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of its consulting subsidiary  spherix consulting  inc for nominal consideration of less than  on november   but effective as of december   dr

in late  the company entered into a new five year shareholder rights plan

if the acquisition is completed  the company may engage in commercialization activities related to the inventions that are the subject of such patents 
in late february   the board of directors appointed harvey j 
kesner as interim chief executive officer of the company 
in early march   we issued series c convertible preferred stock in exchange for warrants we issued in our november  private placement transaction 
the company is examining its business strategies and strategic alternatives 
it has deferred any substantial financial commitments in its biospherics unit 
results of operations compared with revenue revenue in is primarily related to royalty fees from an oil detection agreement 
no substantial revenue is expected from the biospherics segment until the company is successful in selling or licensing its technology 
research and development research and development expenditures relate solely to the biospherics segment and consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  and other expenses related to our efforts to develop spxt for use in lowering triglyceride and cholesterol levels 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
the company does not intend to incur any material r d costs for its biospherics unit in or thereafter and currently is seeking buyers to acquire the biospherics inventory and business in whole or in part or to joint venture or license such business 
the company believes it is unlikely that a buyer may be identified and as a result may liquidate or dispose of its inventory of tagatose for which material storage fees are being incurred 
the company may be required to incur costs for disposal and cessation of this segment 
the decrease in r d costs in of  from reflects the completion of spxt preclinical studies 
no further studies are presently planned 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and other administrative personnel  professional fees and other corporate expenses  including facilities related expenses 
s  g a expenses were consistent between years 
severance retention expense for the continuing staff is being recognized evenly over the required performance period from the date of each agreement  with  recognized in and the remaining  to be recognized during the first half of no severance expenses were incurred in other income from change in fair value of warrants other income from change in fair value of warrants is the result of decreases in the carrying amount of the warrant liability caused by changes in the fair value as determined using a black scholes option valuation method 
the difference between the other income from change in fair value of warrants realized in compared to is the result of a more pronounced change in the company s stock price for the year ending loss on issuance of warrants the loss on issuance of warrants reflects the difference in the fair market value of the warrants as determined using a black scholes option valuation method and the proceeds received 
the proceeds received from warrants issued with other instruments such as common stock or preferred stock are determined based upon the fair value of liability classified warrants with the residual allocated to the other instruments 
the increase between years is directly related to the change in the company s stock price between years 
interest income interest income in and was primarily derived from interest earned on the net proceeds of our equity offerings 
other income in october  the company was awarded two one time grants from the us government under the patient protection and affordable care act 
the awards were for the company s diabetes and triglyceride research 
as a result  in the company recognized  in other income and a related tax expense of  no grants were recognized in gain on settlement of obligations on january   biospherics incorporated  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  filed a complaint for injunction relief and damages in the united states district court for the district of maryland against inalco spa the complaint 
the complaint alleged that inalco had breached the manufacturing support and supply agreement as inalco i refused to supply d tagatose previously paid for by biospherics  ii refused to provide a promised bank guarantee  and iii shut down its d tagatose production facilities 
on march   both parties signed a settlement agreement whereby inalco agreed to supply spherix with metric tons of d tagatose  which has been received by spherix  and both parties have agreed to release each other from any other obligations under the previous agreement 
as a result  the company recognized a gain of  in march on the release from its purchase obligation 
in january  the company entered into a letter agreement with gilbert v 
levin and m 
karen levin pursuant to which the company agreed to make a one time lump sum payment of  to the levins in full satisfaction of the company s obligation to make a series of continuing payments to the levins relating to their prior employment by the company 
per the terms of the agreement  gilbert v 
levin resigned as a member of the board of directors of the company on january  the company s estimated liability to the levins at december   and prior to the above agreement was approximately  the  lump sum payment was made on january   and the company recognized the  difference as a gain on settlement of obligations in january income tax expense the income tax expense was directly related to the above mentioned us government grants in the other income discussion 
no tax expense was incurred in discontinued operations the operations of spherix consulting  inc have been retroactively adjusted as discontinued operations as a result of the december  sale noted above 
the spherix consulting segment generated nearly all of the company s revenue and provided technical support for the company s biospherics segment 
revenue direct cost and operating expense selling  general and administrative expense loss from discontinued operations before taxes sales backlog none critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of the contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenue and expenses for the period reported 
estimates are based upon historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates are evaluated periodically and form the basis for making judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenue and expenses 
actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 
spherix s critical accounting policies are those it believes are the most important in determining its financial condition and results  and require significant subjective judgment by management as a result of inherent uncertainties 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is set out in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
such policies are discussed below 
accounting for taxes and valuation allowances we currently have significant deferred tax assets  resulting from net operating loss carry forwards 
these deferred tax assets may reduce taxable income in future periods 
based on the company s losses and its accumulated deficit  the company has provided a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset 
cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment of valuation allowances 
we expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until an appropriate level of profitability is sustained  or we are able to develop tax strategies that would enable us to conclude that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets would be realizable 
accounting for warrants the company accounts for the issuance of common stock purchase warrants issued in connection with the equity offerings in accordance with the provisions of asc  derivatives and hedging asc 
the company classifies as equity any contracts that i require physical settlement or net share settlement or ii gives the company a choice of net cash settlement or settlement in its own shares physical settlement or net share settlement 
the company classifies as assets or liabilities any contracts that i require net cash settlement including a requirement to net cash settle the contract if an event occurs and if that event is outside the control of the company or ii gives the counterparty a choice of net cash settlement or settlement in shares physical settlement or net share settlement 
the company assessed the classification of its common stock purchase warrants as of the date of each offering and through december  and determined that such instruments met the criteria for liability classification 
the warrants are reported on the consolidated balance sheet as a liability at fair value using the black scholes valuation method 
changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants result in the recognition of other income or expense 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued a new accounting standard on the presentation of comprehensive income 
the new standard requires the presentation of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the new standard also requires presentation of adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented 
in december  the fasb deferred the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income  while still requiring entities to adopt the other requirements 
we adopted the new standard on january  the adoption of this standard had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february of  the fasb issued a new accounting standard to improve the transparency of reporting reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income by requiring entities to present in one place information about significant amounts reclassified and  in some cases  to provide cross references to related footnotes 
we are required to adopt the requirements for reclassification of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income as of the beginning of we do not expect this adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued a new accounting standard which was an amendment to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
the amendments explain how to measure fair value and will improve the comparability of fair value measurement presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap and ifrs 
the standard requires new quantitative and qualitative disclosures about the sensitivity of recurring level measurement disclosures  as well as transfers between level and level of the fair value hierarchy 
this authoritative guidance is to be applied prospectively 
the standard was effective and adopted by the company during liquidity and capital resources we continue to incur ongoing administrative and other expenses  including public company expenses  without any corresponding revenue 
if we re commence our pharmaceutical development efforts  we will begin to incur substantial development costs and will not likely receive any revenue for the foreseeable future 
until such time as we earn revenue from our pharmaceutical development business or from a new business venture  we intend to finance our activities through the remaining proceeds of our equity offerings  and additional funds we will seek to raise through the sale of additional securities in the future 
working capital was million and million at december  and december   and cash on hand was million and million  respectively 
management believes that this cash on hand will be sufficient to sustain operations for the next twelve months  including payment of severances aggregating  which are to be paid in the first half of in early december  we sold the stock of our subsidiary spherix consulting  inc for nominal consideration 
this sale allows the company to minimize its administrative and other costs pending completion of the company s review of its strategic alternatives 
in november  the company obtained net proceeds of approximately million in a private placement of common stock and warrants 
the company sold an aggregate of  shares of common stock at a price of per share along with warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants are exercisable for a period of five years 
the company has agreed to register the common stock sold in the offering and the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants 
failure on the part of the company to satisfy certain registration deadlines may subject the company to payment of certain monetary penalties 
the investors have agreed to temporarily waive their right to cause the company to register these shares 
the investors have the right to participate for of any future debt or equity offerings of the company during the two years following the closing 
in february  the company obtained net proceeds of approximately million in a registered direct offering of common stock and warrants 
both the common stock issued in the offering and the underlying common stock for the warrants issued in the offering were previously registered under a form s shelf registration statement declared effective by the sec in october we believe our current capital is inadequate to pursue business opportunities via acquisition  which we may desire to pursue in the future and as a result we anticipate we will need to raise additional funds from time to time  which could take the form of debt  equity  convertible securities or a combination of the above 
we may be required to raise capital at prices that are below our current market capitalization value 
the company cannot be assured that it will be able to attract an investor in our securities or raise the additional funds it will likely require in the future  that the company will be able to obtain any required stockholder approval  or that the company will be able to successfully complete additional offerings or sales of its securities 
if we reach a point where we are unable to raise needed additional funds to continue our business activities  we will be forced to cease our business activities in which case the company could also be required to terminate its operations and dissolve 
however  we believe that the company presently has sufficient cash balances to continue as a going concern for the next months based upon its reduced requirements for salaries and other expenses following the disposition of the consulting segment and the reduced activity of its research and development program
