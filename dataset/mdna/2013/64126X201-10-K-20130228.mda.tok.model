critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to utilize accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during a fiscal period 
the sec considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to a company s financial condition and results of operations  and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
we have discussed the selection and development of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures in this report 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable  actual results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on the facts and circumstances available to us at the time  we reasonably could have used different estimates in the current period 
changes in the accounting estimates we use are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
if actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates  our reported financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected 
see the information in our filings with the sec from time to time and item a of this report  risk factors  for certain matters that may bear on our results of operations 
revenue recognition as part of our carrier services  we provide wireline and wireless number portability  implement the allocation of pooled blocks of telephone numbers and provide network management services pursuant to seven contracts with napm 
the aggregate fees for transactions processed under the contracts are determined by an annual fixed fee pricing model under which the annual fixed fee is subject to an annual price escalator of 
in the event that the volume of transactions in a given year is above or below the contractually established volume range for that year  the annual fixed fee may be adjusted up or down  respectively 
at each reporting period  we assess the volume of transactions in comparison to the contractually established volume range for that year and determine the probability of an adjustment  either up or down  to the annual fixed fee 
if we determine 
table of contents an adjustment is probable and measurable  we record the adjustment to revenue in the reporting period in which our assessment is made 
we have not recorded any adjustments to the annual fixed fee since the inception of these contract terms in january for more information regarding our revenue recognition policy  please see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report 
service level standards some of our private commercial contracts require us to meet service level standards and impose corresponding penalties for failure to meet those standards 
we record a provision for these performance related penalties when we become aware that we have failed to meet required service levels  which results in a corresponding reduction of our revenue 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess purchase price paid over the fair value of tangible or identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions 
in accordance with the intangibles goodwill and other topic of the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or asc  we test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may have occurred 
our annual goodwill impairment analysis  which we performed for each of our three reporting units as of october   did not result in an impairment charge 
we determined the estimated fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow method and the market approach  consistent with the approach we utilized in our analysis performed in we also considered the estimated fair values of our reporting units relative to our overall market capitalization 
to assist in the process of determining fair value  we performed internal valuation analyses  considered other publicly available market information and obtained appraisals from external advisors 
significant assumptions used in the determination of fair value under the discounted cash flow method included assumptions regarding market penetration  estimated future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates and long term growth rates 
significant assumptions used in the determination of fair value under the market approach included the selection of comparable companies 
the key assumptions used in our annual goodwill impairment test to determine the fair value of our reporting units included a cash flow projections through  which include growth and allocation assumptions for forecasted revenue and expenses  b cash flow projections beyond  which assume a long term growth rate of  c a discount rate of to applied to the cash flow projections  which rate was based upon each respective reporting unit s weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risks associated with the operations at the time of the assessment  d selection of comparable companies used in the market approach  and e assumptions in weighting the results of the discounted cash flow method and the market approach valuation techniques 
as of the date of our annual impairment test  our estimated fair values for each of our carrier services  enterprise services and information services exceeded their respective carrying value 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units are reasonable  however  these estimates are inherently subjective  and there are a number of factors  including factors outside of our control that could cause actual results to differ from our estimates 
changes in estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
any changes to our key assumptions about our businesses and our prospects  or changes in market conditions  could cause the fair value of one of our reporting units to fall below its carrying value  resulting in a 
table of contents potential impairment charge 
in addition  changes in our organizational structure or how our management allocates resources and assesses performance could result in a change of our operating segments or reporting units  requiring a reallocation and impairment analysis of our goodwill 
a goodwill impairment charge could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements because of the significance of goodwill to our consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   we had million  million  and million in goodwill for our carrier services  enterprise services  and information services operating segments  respectively 
accounts receivable  revenue recovery collections  and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
in accordance with our contracts with napm  we bill a revenue recovery collections  or rrc  fee of a percentage of monthly billings to our customers 
the aggregate rrc fees collected may be used to offset uncollectible receivables from an individual customer 
beginning july   the rrc fee was of monthly billings 
on july   the rrc fee was reduced to and further reduced to on july  any accrued rrc fees in excess of uncollectible receivables are paid back to the customers annually on a pro rata basis 
all other receivables related to services not covered by the rrc fees are evaluated and  if deemed not collectible  are appropriately reserved 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such amounts are expected to reverse or be utilized 
the realization of deferred tax assets is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income 
when appropriate  we recognize a valuation allowance to reduce such deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be ultimately realized 
the calculation of deferred tax assets  including valuation allowances  and liabilities requires us to apply significant judgment related to such factors as the application of complex tax laws  changes in tax laws and our future operations 
we review our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine if a valuation allowance is required based upon these factors 
changes in our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance could give rise to a change in such allowance  potentially resulting in additional expense or benefit in the period of change 
our income tax provision includes us federal  state  local and foreign income taxes and is based on pre tax income or loss 
in determining the annual effective income tax rate  we analyzed various factors  including our annual earnings and taxing jurisdictions in which the earnings were generated  the impact of state and local income taxes and our ability to use tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards 
we assess uncertain tax positions and recognize income tax benefits when  based on the technical merits of a tax position  we believe that if a dispute arose with the taxing authority and was taken to a court of last resort  it is more likely than not ie  a probability of greater than percent that the tax position would be sustained as filed 
if a position is determined to be more likely than not of being sustained  the reporting enterprise should recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority 
our practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
we file income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions 
the tax years through remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject 
the internal revenue service has initiated an examination of our federal income tax return 
while the ultimate outcome of the audit is uncertain  management does not currently believe that the outcome will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents american taxpayer relief act of on january   president barack obama signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of  or the act 
while congress approved a retroactive extension of certain business tax provisions that expired at the end of and  under us gaap  the financial accounting effects of the act are to be reported in the first quarter of calendar year  the quarter in which the legislation was signed into law by the president 
we do not believe the act will have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense in accordance with the compensation stock compensation topic of the fasb asc which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for stock based awards granted to employees based on estimated fair values on the date of grant 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for information regarding our assumptions related to stock based compensation and the amount of stock based compensation expense we incurred for the years covered in this report 
we estimate the fair value of our restricted stock unit awards based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
our outstanding restricted stock unit awards are subject to service based vesting conditions and performance based vesting conditions 
we recognize the estimated fair value of service based awards  net of estimated forfeitures  as stock based compensation expense over the vesting period on a straight line basis 
awards with performance based vesting conditions require the achievement of specific financial targets at the end of the specified performance period and the employee s continued employment over the vesting period 
we recognize the estimated fair value of performance based awards  net of estimated forfeitures  as stock based compensation expense over the vesting period  which considers each performance period or tranche separately  based upon our determination of whether it is probable that the performance targets will be achieved 
at each reporting period  we reassess the probability of achieving the performance targets within the related performance period 
determining whether the performance targets will be achieved involves judgment  and the estimate of stock based compensation expense may be revised periodically based on changes in the probability of achieving the performance targets 
if any performance goals are not met  no compensation cost is ultimately recognized against that goal  and to the extent previously recognized  compensation cost is reversed 
during  we revised our estimate of achievement of the performance target related to the pvrsus granted during from of target to of target and further revised our estimate of achievement in the fourth quarter of to of target 
these changes in estimates did not have a material impact on our income from continuing operations and the earnings per diluted share from continuing operations  respectively  for the year ended december

contractual obligations our principal commitments consist of obligations under our notes  credit facilities  leases for office space  computer equipment and furniture and fixtures  and deferred tax liabilities 
the following table summarizes our long term contractual obligations as december  for our capital lease obligations  operating lease obligations  and deferred tax liabilities  and as of january  for our term facility and notes payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands capital lease obligations operating lease obligations term facility notes deferred tax liabilities total on january   we refinanced our term facility with the notes and the term facility under the credit facilities 
interest expense related to the notes has been calculated using a fixed interest rate 
interest expense related to the term facility has been calculated using a rate of as of january  some of our commercial commitments are secured by standby letters of credit 
the following is a summary of our commercial commitments secured by standby letters of credit by commitment date as of december  total less than year years years more than years in thousands standby letters of credit the amounts presented in the tables above may not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements because the actual timing of the future payments made may vary from the stated contractual obligation 
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  we have not included million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest thereon  in the contractual obligations table above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for a discussion on income taxes

off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our term facility  investments  and foreign currency fluctuations 
borrowings outstanding under our term facility bore interest  at our option  either at the base rate  which was defined as the highest of a the federal funds rate plus  b the interest rate published by the wall street journal as the us prime rate and c the adjusted libor rate for a one month interest period beginning on such day plus  provided that the base rate for loans under the term facility was deemed to be not less than per annum or at the libor rate plus  in each case  an applicable margin 
the applicable margin was in respect of the term facility  per annum for borrowings based on the base rate and per annum for borrowings based on the libor rate  and in respect of the revolving facility  per annum for borrowings based on the base rate and per annum borrowings based on the libor rate 
as of december   the libor rate on our term facility was below the applicable margin  or floor  and a hypothetical increase or decrease of in the libor rate would not have impacted our interest rate 
exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates affects the value of our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge against such risk in our investment portfolio 
we invest in securities of highly rated issuers and follow investment policies limiting  among other things  the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we seek to limit default risk by purchasing only investment grade securities 
we do not actively manage the risk of interest rate fluctuations on our short term investments  however  our exposure to this risk is mitigated by the relatively short term nature of these investments 
based on a hypothetical adverse movement in interest rates  the impact on our interest income for our short term investments for the year ended december  would have been insignificant 
we have accounts on our foreign subsidiaries ledgers which are maintained in the respective subsidiary s local foreign currency and remeasured into the united states dollar 
as a result  we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the united states dollar and against the currencies of other countries in which we sell services 
as of december   our assets and liabilities related to non dollar denominated currencies were primarily related to intercompany payables and receivables 
an increase or decrease of in foreign exchange rate would not have a material impact on our financial position 
because our sales and expense are primarily denominated in local currency  the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on sales and expenses has not been material  and we do not employ measures intended to manage foreign exchange rate risk
