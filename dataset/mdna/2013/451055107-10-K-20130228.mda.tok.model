we believe that we will be able to satisfy our ongoing cash requirements for operations and debt servicing for the foreseeable future  primarily with cash flow from operations and if necessary our ability to draw down additional funds under our variable funded notes 
in addition  as part of our business growth strategy  we intend  in addition to growing through the organic development of our brands and expanding internationally  to grow through acquisitions of additional brands

the following is a summary of contractual cash obligations  including interest for the periods indicated that existed as of december  s omitted thereafter total senior secured notes convertible notes ecko note operating leases employment contracts interest total contractual cash obligations other factors we continue to seek to expand and diversify the types of licensed products being produced under our various brands  as well as diversify the distribution channels within which licensed products are sold  in an effort to reduce dependence on any particular retailer  consumer or market sector 
the success of our company  however  remains largely dependent on our ability to build and maintain brand awareness and contract with and retain key licensees and on our licensees ability to accurately predict upcoming trends within their respective customer bases and fulfill the product requirements of their particular distribution channels within the global marketplace 
unanticipated changes in consumer fashion preferences  slowdowns in the global economy  changes in the prices of supplies  consolidation of retail establishments  and other factors noted in risk factors  could adversely affect our licensees ability to meet and or exceed their contractual commitments to us and thereby adversely affect our future operating results 
effects of inflation we do not believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation experienced over the past few years in the united states  where we primarily compete  have had a significant effect on revenues or profitability 
if there were an adverse change in the rate of inflation by less than  the expected effect on net income would be immaterial 
new accounting standards in july  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
asu simplifies the guidance for testing the decline in the realizable value impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill by allowing an organization the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test 
an organization electing to perform a qualitative assessment is no longer required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset unless the organization determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired 
the amendments in this update are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of asu will not have a material impact on our results of operations or our financial position 
in october  the fasb issued asu  technical corrections and improvements 
asu contains amendments to clarify the asc  correct unintended application of guidance  or make minor improvements to the asc that are not expected to have a significant effect on current accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost to most entities 
additionally  the amendments are intended to make the asc easier to understand and the fair value measurement guidance easier to apply by eliminating inconsistencies and providing needed clarifications 
the amendments that do not have transition guidance were effective upon issuance 
the amendments that are subject to the transition guidance will be effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  the adoption of asu will not have a material impact on our results of operations or our financial position 
in february  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
asu requires an entity to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of 
table of contents accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in net income if the amount being reclassified is required to be reclassified in its entirety to net income 
for other amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting period  an entity is required to cross reference other disclosures that provide additional detail about those amounts 
the amendments do not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements 
for public entities  the amendments are effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december  critical accounting policies several of our accounting policies involve management judgments and estimates that could be significant 
the policies with the greatest potential effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position include the estimate of reserves to provide for collectability of accounts receivable 
we estimate collectability considering historical  current and anticipated trends of our licensees related to deductions taken by customers and markdowns provided to retail customers to effectively flow goods through the retail channels  and the possibility of non collection due to the financial position of our licensees and their retail customers 
due to our licensing model  we do not have any inventory risk and have reduced our operating risks  and can reasonably forecast revenues and plan expenditures based upon guaranteed royalty minimums and sales projections provided by our retail and other licensees 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we review all significant estimates affecting the financial statements on a recurring basis and record the effect of any adjustments when necessary 
in connection with our licensing model  we have entered into various trademark license agreements that provide revenues based on minimum royalties and additional revenues based on a percentage of defined sales 
minimum royalty revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over each period  as defined  in each license agreement 
royalties exceeding the defined minimum amounts are recognized as income during the period corresponding to the licensee s sales 
in june  the fasb issued guidance under asc topic intangibles goodwill and other  which changed the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
upon our adoption of this guidance  on february   we ceased amortizing goodwill 
as prescribed under this guidance  we had goodwill tested for impairment during the years fy  fy and fy  and no write downs from impairments were necessary 
our tests for impairment utilize discounted cash flow models to estimate the fair values of the individual assets 
assumptions critical to our fair value estimates are as follow i discount rates used to derive the present value factors used in determining the fair value of the reporting units and trademarks  ii royalty rates used in our trademark valuations  iii projected average revenue growth rates used in the reporting unit and trademark models  and iv projected long term growth rates used in the derivation of terminal year values 
these tests factor in economic conditions and expectations of management and may change in the future based on period specific facts and circumstances 
impairment losses are recognized for long lived assets  including certain intangibles  used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are not sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount 
impairment losses are measured by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying amount 
for the years fy  fy and fy there was no impairment present for these long lived assets 
effective january   we adopted guidance under asc topic compensation stock compensation  which requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments at fair value 
under this guidance  using the modified prospective method  compensation expense is recognized for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january  prior to the adoption of this guidance  we accounted for our stock based compensation plans under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
accordingly  the compensation cost for stock options had been measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our common stock at the date of the grant over the amount the employee must pay to acquire the stock 
we account for income taxes in accordance with guidance under asc topic income taxes 
under this guidance  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
in determining the need for a valuation allowance  management reviews both positive and negative evidence pursuant to the requirements of this guidance  including current and historical results of operations  the annual limitation on utilization of net operating loss carry forwards pursuant to internal revenue code section  future income projections and the overall prospects of our business 
based upon management s assessment of all available evidence  including our completed transition into a licensing business  estimates of future profitability based on projected royalty revenues from our licensees  and the overall prospects of our business  management concluded that it is more likely than not that the net deferred income tax asset will be realized 
we adopted guidance under asc topic  beginning january   as it relates to uncertain tax positions 
the implementation of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
the total unrecognized tax benefit was million at the date of adoption 
at december   the total unrecognized tax benefit was million 
however  this 
table of contents unrecognized tax benefit is not recognized for accounting purposes because the related deferred tax asset has been fully reserved in prior years 
we are continuing our practice of recognizing interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
there was no accrual for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions for the year ended december  we file federal and state tax returns and we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations for fiscal years prior to item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we limit exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by requiring the majority of our licenses to be denominated in us dollars 
certain other licenses are denominated in japanese yen and the euro 
to mitigate interest rate risks  we have  from time to time  purchased derivative financial instruments such as forward contracts to convert certain portions of our revenue and cash received in foreign currencies to fixed exchange rates 
if there were an adverse change in the exchange rate from japanese yen to us dollars or the euro to us dollars of less than  the expected effect on net income would be immaterial 
moreover  in connection with the warrant transaction with the counterparties related to our convertible notes  to the extent that the price of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants  the warrant transaction could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share 
the effect  if any  of these transactions and activities on the trading price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time  but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock
