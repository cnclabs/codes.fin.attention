item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
raw materials the materials and supplies we use in our drilling and production services operations include fuels to operate our equipment  drilling mud  drill pipe  drill collars  drill bits and cement 
we do not rely on a single source of supply for any of these items 
while we are not currently experiencing any shortages  from time to time there have been shortages of drilling equipment and supplies during periods of high demand 
shortages could result in increased prices for drilling equipment or supplies that we may be unable to pass on to clients 
in addition  during periods of shortages  the delivery times for equipment and supplies can be substantially longer 
any significant delays in obtaining drilling equipment or supplies could limit our drilling operations and jeopardize our relations with clients 
in addition  shortages of drilling equipment or supplies could delay and adversely affect our ability to obtain new contracts for our drilling rigs  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
operating risks and insurance our operations are subject to the many hazards inherent in the contract land drilling business  including the risks of blowouts  fires and explosions  loss of well control  collapse of the borehole  lost or stuck drill strings  and damage or loss from natural disasters 
any of these hazards can result in substantial liabilities or losses to us from  among other things suspension of drilling operations  damage to  or destruction of  our property and equipment and that of others  personal injury and loss of life  damage to producing or potentially productive oil and gas formations through which we drill  and environmental damage 
we seek to protect ourselves from some but not all operating hazards through insurance coverage 
however  some risks are either not insurable or insurance is available only at rates that we consider uneconomical 
those risks include pollution liability in excess of relatively low limits 
depending on competitive conditions and other factors  we attempt to obtain contractual protection against uninsured operating risks from our clients 
however  clients who provide contractual indemnification protection may not in all cases maintain adequate insurance to support their indemnification obligations 
our insurance or indemnification arrangements may not adequately protect us against liability or loss from all the hazards of our operations 
the occurrence of a significant event that we have not fully insured or indemnified against or the failure of a client to meet its indemnification obligations to us could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable 
our current insurance coverage includes property insurance on our rigs  drilling equipment  production services equipment and real property 
our insurance coverage for property damage to our rigs  drilling equipment and production services equipment is based on our estimates of the cost of comparable used equipment to replace the insured property 
the policy provides for a deductible on drilling rigs of  per occurrence  deductible for rigs with an insured value greater than million  and a deductible on production services equipment of  per occurrence 
our third party liability insurance coverage is million per occurrence and in the aggregate  with a deductible of  per occurrence 
we also carry insurance coverage for pollution liability up to million with a deductible of  we believe that we are adequately insured for public liability and property damage to others with respect to our operations 
however  such insurance may not be sufficient to protect us against liability for all consequences of well disasters  extensive fire damage or damage to the environment 
in addition  we generally carry insurance coverage to protect against certain hazards inherent in our turnkey contract drilling operations 
this insurance covers control of well  including blowouts above and below the surface  redrilling  seepage and pollution 
this policy provides coverage of million  million  million  million or million depending on the area in which the well is drilled and its target depth  subject to a deductible of the greater of of the well s anticipated dry hole cost or  this policy also provides care  custody and control insurance  with a limit of million  subject to a  deductible 
employees we currently have approximately  employees 
approximately of these employees are salaried administrative or supervisory employees 
the rest of our employees are working in operations for our drilling services segment and production services segment and are primarily compensated on an hourly basis 
the number of employees in operations fluctuates depending on the utilization of our drilling rigs  well servicing rigs  wireline units and coiled tubing units at any particular time 
none of our employment arrangements are subject to collective bargaining arrangements 
our operations require the services of employees having the technical training and experience necessary to achieve proper operational standards 
as a result  our operations depend  to a considerable extent  on the continuing availability of such personnel 
although we have not encountered material difficulty in hiring and retaining employees in our operations  shortages of qualified personnel have occurred in our industry 
if we should suffer any material loss of personnel to competitors or be unable to employ additional or replacement personnel with the requisite level of training and experience to adequately operate our equipment  our operations could be materially and adversely affected 
while we believe our wage rates are competitive and our relationships with our employees are satisfactory  a significant increase in the wages paid by other employers could result in a reduction in our workforce  increases in wage rates  or both 
the occurrence of either of these events for a significant period of time could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
facilities we lease our corporate office facilities located at ne loop  suite san antonio  texas we conduct our business operations through other real estate locations  of which we own  in the united states texas  oklahoma  colorado  utah  montana  north dakota  pennsylvania  wyoming  mississippi  arkansas  louisiana and kansas and internationally in colombia 
these real estate locations are primarily used for regional offices and storage and maintenance yards 
governmental regulation our operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations relating to containment  disposal and controlling the discharge of hazardous oilfield waste and other non hazardous waste material into the environment  requiring removal and cleanup under certain circumstances  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
in addition  our operations are often conducted in or near ecologically sensitive areas  such as wetlands and coastal areas of the gulf of mexico  which are subject to special protective measures and which may expose us to additional operating costs and liabilities for accidental discharges of oil  natural gas  drilling fluids or contaminated water  or for noncompliance with other aspects of applicable laws 
we are also subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act osha and comparable state statutes 
the osha hazard communication standard  the environmental protection agency epa community right to know regulations under title iii of the federal superfund amendment and reauthorization act and comparable state statutes require us to organize and report information about the hazardous materials we use in our operations to employees  state and local government authorities and local citizens 
environmental laws and regulations are complex and subject to frequent change 
in some cases  they can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party  without regard to negligence or fault  and can impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused  or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them 
we may also be exposed to environmental or other liabilities originating from businesses and assets that we purchased from others 
compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations has not  to date  materially affected our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position  although compliance measures have added to our costs of operating drilling equipment in some instances 
we do not expect to incur material capital expenditures in our next fiscal year in order to comply with current environment control regulations 
however  our compliance with amended  new or more stringent requirements  stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination may require us to make material expenditures or subject us to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate 
there are a variety of regulatory developments  proposals or requirements and legislative initiatives that have been introduced in the united states and international regions in which we operate that are focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide  methane and other greenhouse gases 
among these developments are the united nations framework convention on climate change  also known as the kyoto protocol an internationally applied protocol  which has been ratified in colombia  one of our reporting segments  the regional greenhouse gas initiative or rggi in the northeastern united states  and the western regional climate action initiative in the western united states 
the us congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases  primarily through the development of greenhouse gas cap and trade programs 
in addition  more than one third of the states already have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases 
in  the united states supreme court in massachusetts  et al 
v 
epa  held that carbon dioxide may be regulated as an air pollutant under the federal clean air act 
on december   the epa responded to the massachusetts  et al 
v 
epa decision and issued a finding that the current and projected concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations  and that certain greenhouse gases from motor vehicles contribute to the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and hence to the threat of climate change 
based on these findings  in the epa adopted two sets of regulations that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the federal clean air act  including one that requires a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and another that requires certain construction and operating permit reviews for greenhouse gas emissions from certain large stationary sources 
the stationary source final rule addresses the permitting of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources under the clean air act prevention of significant deterioration construction and title v operating permit programs  pursuant to which these permit programs have been tailored to apply to certain stationary sources of greenhouse gas emissions in a multi step process  with the largest sources first subject to permitting 
in addition  the epa adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gases from certain sources  including  among others  onshore oil and natural gas production facilities 
in april  the epa issued regulations specifically applicable to the oil and gas industry that will require operators to significantly reduce volatile organic compounds  or voc  emissions from natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured through the use of green completions to capture natural gas that would otherwise escape into the air 
the epa also issued regulations that establish standards for voc emissions from several types of equipment at natural gas well sites  including storage tanks  compressors  dehydrators and pneumatic controllers 
although it is not possible at this time to predict whether proposed legislation or regulations will be adopted as initially written  if at all  or how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business  any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions 
any additional costs or operating restrictions associated with legislation or regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows 
in addition  these developments could curtail the demand for fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our clients operate and thus adversely affect demand for our services  which may in turn adversely affect our future results of operations 
finally  we cannot predict with any certainty whether changes to temperature  storm intensity or precipitation patterns as a result of climate change will have a material impact on our operations 
hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injection of water  sand  and a minor amount of certain chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon bearing rock formation to allow flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore 
the federal energy policy act of amended the underground injection control provisions of the federal safe drinking water act sdwa to exclude certain hydraulic fracturing practices from the definition of underground injection 
the epa has asserted regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel fuel and has developed draft guidance relating to such practices 
in addition  repeal of the sdwa exclusion of hydraulic fracturing has been advocated by certain advocacy organizations and others in the public 
congress has from time to time considered legislation to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the sdwa  which would have the effect of allowing the epa to promulgate new regulations and permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing  and to require the disclosure of the chemical constituents of hydraulic fracturing fluids to a regulatory agency  which would make the information public via the internet 
scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing activities continues in other ways  with the epa having commenced a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing  the final results of which are expected in in addition  in april  the epa issued the first federal air standards for natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured  which will require operators to significantly reduce voc emissions through the use of green completions to capture natural gas that would otherwise escape into the air 
moreover  the epa is developing effluent limitations for the treatment and discharge of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities and plans to propose these standards by the us department of the interior has also proposed regulations relating to the use of hydraulic fracturing techniques on public lands and disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents 
in addition  some states and localities have adopted  and others are considering adopting  regulations or ordinances that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances  that would require  with some exceptions  disclosure of constituents of hydraulic fracturing fluids  or that would impose higher taxes  fees or royalties on natural gas production 
moreover  public debate over hydraulic fracturing and shale gas production has been increasing  and has resulted in delays of well permits in some areas 
increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition  including litigation  to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques 
additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas  including from the developing shale plays  incurred by our clients 
the adoption of any federal  state or local laws or the implementation of regulations or ordinances restricting or increasing the costs of hydraulic fracturing could cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and natural gas wells and an associated decrease in demand for our drilling and well servicing activities  any or all of which could adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  our business depends on the demand for land drilling and production services from the oil and gas industry and  therefore  is affected by tax  environmental and other laws relating to the oil and gas industry generally  by changes in those laws and by changes in related administrative regulations 
it is possible that these laws and regulations may in the future add significantly to our operating costs or those of our clients  or otherwise directly or indirectly affect our operations 
our wireline operations involve the use of radioactive isotopes along with other nuclear  electrical  acoustic  and mechanical devices 
our activities involving the use of isotopes are regulated by the us nuclear regulatory commission and specified agencies of certain states 
additionally  we use high explosive charges for perforating casing and formations  and we use various explosive cutters to assist in wellbore cleanout 
such operations are regulated by the us department of justice  bureau of alcohol  tobacco  firearms  and explosives and require us to obtain licenses or other approvals for the use of densitometers as well as explosive charges 
we have obtained these licenses and approvals when necessary and believe that we are in substantial compliance with these federal requirements 
among the services we provide  we operate as a motor carrier for the transportation of our own equipment and therefore are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation and by various state agencies 
these regulatory authorities exercise broad powers  governing activities such as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations and regulatory safety 
there are additional regulations specifically relating to the trucking industry  including testing and specification of equipment and product handling requirements 
the trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing truckload services 
some of these possible changes include increasingly stringent environmental regulations  changes in the hours of service regulations which govern the amount of time a driver may drive in any specific period  onboard black box recorder devices or limits on vehicle weight and size 
interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the us department of transportation 
to a large degree  intrastate motor carrier operations are subject to state safety regulations that mirror federal regulations 
such matters as weight and dimension of equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations 
from time to time  various legislative proposals are introduced  including proposals to increase federal  state  or local taxes  including taxes on motor fuels  which may increase our costs or adversely impact the recruitment of drivers 
we cannot predict whether  or in what form  any increase in such taxes applicable to us will be enacted

item a 
risk factors the information set forth in this item a should be read in conjunction with the rest of the information included in this report  including management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item and the financial statements and related notes this report contains 
while we attempt to identify  manage and mitigate risks and uncertainties associated with our business to the extent practical under the circumstances  some level of risk and uncertainty will always be present 
additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may negatively impact our business  financial condition or operating results 
set forth below are various risks and uncertainties that could adversely impact our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
risks relating to the oil and gas industry we derive all our revenues from companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry  a historically cyclical industry with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and gas prices 
as a provider of contract land drilling services and oil and gas production services  our business depends on the level of exploration and production activity in the geographic markets where we operate 
the oil and gas exploration and production industry is a historically cyclical industry characterized by significant changes in the levels of exploration and development activities 
oil and gas prices  and market expectations of potential changes in those prices  significantly affect the levels of those activities 
worldwide political  economic  and military events as well as natural disasters have contributed to oil and gas price volatility and are likely to continue to do so in the future 
any prolonged reduction in the overall level of exploration and development activities  whether resulting from changes in oil and gas prices or otherwise  could materially and adversely affect us by negatively impacting our revenues  cash flows and profitability  the fair market value of our drilling rig fleet and production services equipment  our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity  our ability to obtain additional capital to finance our business and make acquisitions  and the cost of that capital  and our ability to retain skilled rig personnel whom we would need in the event of an upturn in the demand for our services 
depending on the market prices of oil and gas  oil and gas exploration and production companies may cancel or curtail their drilling programs and may lower production spending on existing wells  thereby reducing demand for our services 
many factors beyond our control affect oil and gas prices  including the cost of exploring for  producing and delivering oil and gas  the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves  the rate of decline of existing and new oil and gas reserves  available pipeline and other oil and gas transportation capacity  the levels of oil and gas storage  the ability of oil and gas exploration and production companies to raise capital  economic conditions in the united states and elsewhere  actions by opec  the organization of petroleum exporting countries  political instability in the middle east and other major oil and gas producing regions  governmental regulations  both domestic and foreign  domestic and foreign tax policy  weather conditions in the united states and elsewhere  the pace adopted by foreign governments for the exploration  development and production of their national reserves  the price of foreign imports of oil and gas  and the overall supply and demand for oil and gas 
oil and gas prices have been volatile historically and  we believe  will continue to be so in the future 
during late and continuing into late  oil and natural gas prices fell significantly below the levels seen in mid while oil prices have generally recovered from the low levels in late  natural gas prices have remained depressed 
future declines in and volatility in oil and gas prices could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results 
risks relating to our business reduced demand for or excess capacity of drilling services or production services could adversely affect our profitability 
our profitability in the future will depend on many factors  but largely on pricing and utilization rates for our drilling and production services 
a reduction in the demand for drilling rigs or an increase in the supply of drilling rigs  whether through new construction or refurbishment  could decrease the dayrates and utilization rates for our drilling services  which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
an increase in supply of well servicing rigs  wireline units  coiled tubing units  and fishing and rental tools and equipment  without a corresponding increase in demand  could similarly decrease the pricing and utilization rates of our production services  which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
we operate in a highly competitive  fragmented industry in which price competition could reduce our profitability 
we encounter substantial competition from other drilling contractors and other oilfield service companies 
our primary market areas are highly fragmented and competitive 
the fact that drilling and production services equipment are mobile and can be moved from one market to another in response to market conditions heightens the competition in the industry and may result in an oversupply of equipment in an area 
contract drilling companies and other oilfield service companies compete primarily on a regional basis  and the intensity of competition may vary significantly from region to region at any particular time 
if demand for drilling or production services improves in a region where we operate  our competitors might respond by moving in suitable rigs and production services equipment from other regions 
an influx of equipment from other regions could rapidly intensify competition  reduce profitability and make any improvement in demand for drilling or production services short lived 
most drilling services contracts and production services contracts are awarded on the basis of competitive bids  which also results in price competition 
in addition to pricing and equipment availability  we believe the following factors are also important to our clients in determining which drilling services or production services provider to select the type and condition of each of the competing drilling rigs  well servicing rigs  wireline units and coiled tubing units  the mobility and efficiency of the equipment  the quality of service and experience of the crews  the safety record of the company providing the services  the offering of ancillary services  and the ability to provide drilling and production services equipment adaptable to  and personnel familiar with  new technologies and drilling and production techniques 
while we must be competitive in our pricing  our competitive strategy generally emphasizes the quality of our equipment  our safety record  our ability to offer ancillary services  the experience of our crews and the quality of service we provide to differentiate us from our competitors 
this strategy is less effective when lower demand for drilling and production services intensifies price competition and makes it more difficult for us to compete on the basis of factors other than price 
in all of the markets in which we compete  an oversupply of drilling rigs or production services equipment can cause greater price competition  which can reduce our profitability 
we face competition from many competitors with greater resources 
some of our competitors have greater financial  technical and other resources than we do 
their greater capabilities in these areas may enable them to better withstand industry downturns  compete more effectively on the basis of price and technology  retain skilled personnel  and build new rigs or acquire and refurbish existing rigs and place them into service more quickly than us in periods of high drilling demand 
additionally  although we take measures to ensure that we use advanced technologies for drilling and production services equipment  changes in technology or improvements in our competitors equipment could make our equipment less competitive or require significant capital investments to keep our equipment competitive 
unexpected cost overruns on our turnkey drilling jobs and our footage contracts could adversely affect our financial position and our results of operations 
we have historically derived a portion of our revenues from turnkey drilling contracts  and we expect turnkey contracts will continue to represent a component of our future revenues 
the occurrence of uninsured or under insured losses or operating cost overruns on our turnkey jobs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
under a typical turnkey drilling contract  we agree to drill a well for our client to a specified depth and under specified conditions for a fixed price 
we provide technical expertise and engineering services  as well as most of the equipment and drilling supplies required to drill the well 
we often subcontract for related services  such as the provision of casing crews  cementing and well logging 
under typical turnkey drilling arrangements  we do not receive progress payments and are paid by our client only after we have performed the terms of the drilling contract in full 
for these reasons  the risk to us under a turnkey drilling contract is substantially greater than for a well drilled on a daywork basis because we must assume most of the risks associated with drilling operations that the operator generally assumes under a daywork contract  including the risks of blowout  loss of hole  stuck drill pipe  machinery breakdowns  abnormal drilling conditions and risks associated with subcontractors services  supplies  cost escalations and personnel 
similar to our turnkey contracts  under a footage contract we assume most of the risks associated with drilling operations that the operator generally assumes under a daywork contract 
in addition  since we are only paid by our clients after we have performed the terms of the drilling contract in full  our liquidity can be affected by the number of turnkey and footage contracts that we enter into 
although we attempt to obtain insurance coverage to reduce certain of the risks inherent in our turnkey drilling operations  adequate coverage may be unavailable in the future and we might have to bear the full cost of such risks  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our operations involve operating hazards  which  if not insured or indemnified against  could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our operations are subject to the many hazards inherent in the drilling and well servicing industries  including the risks of blowouts  cratering  fires and explosions  loss of well control  collapse of the borehole  damaged or lost drilling equipment  and damage or loss from natural disasters 
any of these hazards can result in substantial liabilities or losses to us from  among other things suspension of operations  damage to  or destruction of  our property and equipment and that of others  personal injury and loss of life  damage to producing or potentially productive oil and gas formations through which we drill  and environmental damage 
we seek to protect ourselves from some but not all operating hazards through insurance coverage 
however  some risks are either not insurable or insurance is available only at rates that we consider uneconomical 
those risks include  among other things  pollution liability in excess of relatively low limits 
depending on competitive conditions and other factors  we attempt to obtain contractual protection against uninsured operating risks from our clients 
however  clients who provide contractual indemnification protection may not in all cases maintain adequate insurance or otherwise have the financial resources necessary to support their indemnification obligations 
our insurance or indemnification arrangements may not adequately protect us against liability or loss from all the hazards of our operations 
the occurrence of a significant event that we have not fully insured or indemnified against or the failure of a client to meet its indemnification obligations to us could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  we may be unable to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable 
we could be adversely affected if shortages of equipment  supplies or personnel occur 
from time to time there have been shortages of drilling and production services equipment and supplies during periods of high demand which we believe could recur 
shortages could result in increased prices for drilling and production services equipment or supplies that we may be unable to pass on to clients 
in addition  during periods of shortages  the delivery times for equipment and supplies can be substantially longer 
any significant delays in our obtaining drilling and production services equipment or supplies could limit drilling and production services operations and jeopardize our relations with clients 
in addition  shortages of drilling and production services equipment or supplies could delay and adversely affect our ability to obtain new contracts for our rigs  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our strategy of constructing drilling rigs during periods of peak demand requires that we maintain an adequate supply of drilling rig components to complete our rig building program 
our suppliers may be unable to continue providing us the needed drilling rig components if their manufacturing sources are unable to fulfill their commitments 
our operations require the services of employees having the technical training and experience necessary to achieve the proper operational results 
as a result  our operations depend  to a considerable extent  on the continuing availability of such personnel 
shortages of qualified personnel have occurred in our industry 
if we should suffer any material loss of personnel to competitors or be unable to employ additional or replacement personnel with the requisite level of training and experience to adequately operate our equipment  our operations could be materially and adversely affected 
a significant increase in the wages paid by other employers could result in a reduction in our workforce  increases in wage rates  or both 
the occurrence of either of these events for a significant period of time could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our acquisition strategy exposes us to various risks  including those relating to difficulties in identifying suitable acquisition opportunities and integrating businesses  assets and personnel  as well as difficulties in obtaining financing for targeted acquisitions and the potential for increased leverage or debt service requirements 
as a key component of our business strategy  we have pursued and intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of complementary assets and businesses 
for example  since september  we have significantly expanded our drilling rig fleet through acquisitions and through the construction of rigs from new and used components  and in march  we acquired two production services businesses which significantly expanded our service offerings to include well servicing  wireline services and fishing and rental services 
on december   we acquired the coiled tubing services business of go coil to complement our existing production services offerings 
our acquisition strategy in general  and our recent acquisitions in particular  involve numerous inherent risks  including unanticipated costs and assumption of liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired businesses  including environmental liabilities  difficulties in integrating the operations and assets of the acquired business and the acquired personnel  limitations on our ability to properly assess and maintain an effective internal control environment over an acquired business in order to comply with applicable periodic reporting requirements  potential losses of key employees and clients of the acquired businesses  risks of entering markets in which we have limited prior experience  and increases in our expenses and working capital requirements 
the process of integrating an acquired business may involve unforeseen costs and delays or other operational  technical and financial difficulties that may require a disproportionate amount of management attention and financial and other resources 
our failure to achieve consolidation savings  to incorporate the acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we may not have sufficient capital resources to complete additional acquisitions 
historically  we have funded business acquisitions and the growth of our rig fleet through a combination of debt and equity financing 
we may incur substantial additional indebtedness to finance future acquisitions and also may issue equity securities or convertible securities in connection with such acquisitions 
debt service requirements could represent a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition and the issuance of additional equity or convertible securities could be dilutive to our existing shareholders 
furthermore  we may not be able to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms 
even if we have access to the necessary capital  we may be unable to continue to identify additional suitable acquisition opportunities  negotiate acceptable terms or successfully acquire identified targets 
our indebtedness could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions 
our indebtedness is primarily a result of the two production services businesses that we acquired in and the acquisition of go coil in at december   our total debt balance of million primarily consists of million outstanding under our senior notes 
as of december   our revolving credit facility had a million balance outstanding  with a current availability of million 
our current and future indebtedness could have important consequences  including impairing our ability to make investments and obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other general corporate purposes  limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness  making us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business  our industry or the economy in general as a substantial portion of our operating cash flow could be required to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness  making it more difficult to react to changes in our business  industry and market conditions  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing that may be necessary to operate or expand our business  putting us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors that have less debt  and increasing our vulnerability to rising interest rates 
we anticipate that our cash generated by operations and our ability to borrow under the currently unused portion of our revolving credit facility should allow us to meet our routine financial obligations for at least the next twelve months 
however  our ability to make payments on our indebtedness  and to fund planned capital expenditures  will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to conditions in the oil and gas industry  general economic and financial conditions  competition in the markets where we operate  the impact of legislative and regulatory actions on how we conduct our business and other factors  all of which are beyond our control 
if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our outstanding indebtedness  we may have to undertake alternative financing plans  such as refinancing or restructuring our debt  selling assets  reducing or delaying acquisitions or capital investments  such as refurbishments of our rigs and related equipment  or seeking to raise additional capital 
however  we may be unable to implement alternative financing plans  if necessary  on commercially reasonable terms or at all  and any such alternative financing plans might be insufficient to allow us to meet our debt obligations 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or are otherwise unable to obtain the funds required to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness  or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants in our revolving credit facility or other instruments governing any future indebtedness  we could be in default under the terms of our revolving credit facility or such instruments 
in the event of a default  the lenders under our revolving credit facility could elect to declare all the loans made under such facility to be due and payable together with accrued and unpaid interest and terminate their commitments thereunder and we or one or more of our subsidiaries could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 
any of the foregoing consequences could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
our revolving credit facility and our senior notes impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business 
our revolving credit facility limits our ability to take various actions  such as limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  restrictions on investments  capital expenditures  mergers or consolidations  asset dispositions  acquisitions  transactions with affiliates and other transactions without the lenders consent  and limitation on dividends and distributions 
in addition  our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and to satisfy certain financial conditions  which may require us to reduce our debt or take some other action in order to comply with them 
the indenture governing our senior notes contains certain restrictions on our and certain of our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends on stock  repurchase stock or redeem subordinated debt or make other restricted payments  incur  assume or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue disqualified stock  create liens on the our assets  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  pay dividends  engage in loans  or transfer other assets from certain of our subsidiaries  consolidate with or merge with or into  or sell all or substantially all of our properties to another person  enter into transactions with affiliates  and enter into new lines of business 
the failure to comply with any of these restrictions or conditions would cause an event of default under our revolving credit facility or our senior notes 
an event of default  if not waived  could result in acceleration of the outstanding indebtedness  in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable 
if this occurs  we may not be able to pay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it 
even if new financing is available  it may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us 
these restrictions could also limit our ability to obtain future financing  make needed capital expenditures  withstand a downturn in our business or the economy in general  or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities 
we also may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facility and our senior notes 
our international operations are subject to political  economic and other uncertainties not encountered in our domestic operations 
our international operations are subject to political  economic and other uncertainties not generally encountered in our us operations which include  among potential others risks of war  terrorism  civil unrest and kidnapping of employees  expropriation  confiscation or nationalization of our assets  renegotiation or nullification of contracts  foreign taxation  the inability to repatriate earnings or capital due to laws limiting the right and ability of foreign subsidiaries to pay dividends and remit earnings to affiliated companies  changing political conditions and changing laws and policies affecting trade and investment  concentration of clients  regional economic downturns  the overlap of different tax structures  the burden of complying with multiple and potentially conflicting laws  the risks associated with the assertion of foreign sovereignty over areas in which our operations are conducted  the risks associated with any lack of compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act of fcpa or other anti corruption laws  the risks associated with fluctuating currency values  hard currency shortages and controls of foreign currency exchange  difficulty in collecting international accounts receivable  and potentially longer payment cycles 
our international operations are concentrated in colombia and most of our drilling contracts are with one client  ecopetrol 
we believe our relationship with ecopetrol is good  however  the loss of this large client could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and result of operations 
additionally  we may be subject to foreign governmental regulations favoring or requiring the awarding of contracts to local contractors or requiring foreign contractors to employ citizens of  or purchase supplies from  a particular jurisdiction 
these regulations could adversely affect our ability to compete 
we are committed to doing business in accordance with applicable anti corruption laws and our code of conduct and ethics 
we are subject  however  to the risk that our employees and agents may take action determined to be in violation of anti corruption laws  including the fcpa or other similar laws 
any violation of the fcpa or other applicable anti corruption laws could result in substantial fines  sanctions  civil and or criminal penalties and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions and might materially adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and ability to do business 
further  detecting  investigating  and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management 
our operations are subject to various laws and governmental regulations that could restrict our future operations and increase our operating costs 
many aspects of our operations are subject to various federal  state and local laws and governmental regulations  including laws and regulations governing environmental quality  pollution control  remediation of contamination  preservation of natural resources  transportation  and worker safety 
our operations are subject to stringent federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations governing the protection of the environment and human health and safety 
some of those laws  rules and regulations relate to the disposal of hazardous substances  oilfield waste and other waste materials and restrict the types  quantities and concentrations of those substances that can be released into the environment 
several of those laws also require removal and remedial action and other cleanup under certain circumstances  commonly regardless of fault 
our operations routinely involve the handling of significant amounts of waste materials  some of which are classified as hazardous substances 
planning  implementation and maintenance of protective measures are required to prevent accidental discharges 
spills of oil  natural gas liquids  drilling fluids and other substances may subject us to penalties and cleanup requirements 
handling  storage and disposal of both hazardous and non hazardous wastes are also subject to these regulatory requirements 
in addition  our operations are often conducted in or near ecologically sensitive areas  such as wetlands  which are subject to special protective measures and which may expose us to additional operating costs and liabilities for accidental discharges of oil  gas  drilling fluids  contaminated water or other substances  or for noncompliance with other aspects of applicable laws and regulations 
the federal clean water act  as amended by the oil pollution act  the federal clean air act  the federal resource conservation and recovery act  the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  or cercla  the safe drinking water act  or sdwa  the federal outer continental shelf lands act  the occupational safety and health act  or osha  and their state counterparts and similar statutes are the primary statutes that impose the requirements described above and provide for civil  criminal and administrative penalties and other sanctions for violation of their requirements 
the osha hazard communication standard  the environmental protection agency community right to know regulations under title iii of the federal superfund amendment and reauthorization act and comparable state statutes require us to organize and report information about the hazardous materials we use in our operations to employees  state and local government authorities and local citizens 
in addition  cercla  also known as the superfund law  and similar state statutes impose strict liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons who are considered responsible for the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment 
these persons include the current owner or operator of a facility where a release has occurred  the owner or operator of a facility at the time a release occurred  and companies that disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at a particular site 
this liability may be joint and several 
such liability  which may be imposed for the conduct of others and for conditions others have caused  includes the cost of removal and remedial action as well as damages to natural resources 
few defenses exist to the liability imposed by environmental laws and regulations 
it is also common for third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage caused by substances released into the environment 
environmental laws and regulations are complex and subject to frequent change 
failure to comply with governmental requirements or inadequate cooperation with governmental authorities could subject a responsible party to administrative  civil or criminal action 
we may also be exposed to environmental or other liabilities originating from businesses and assets which we acquired from others 
our compliance with amended  new or more stringent requirements  stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination or regulatory noncompliance may require us to make material expenditures or subject us to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate 
there are a variety of regulatory developments  proposals or requirements and legislative initiatives that have been introduced in the united states and international regions in which we operate that are focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide  methane and other greenhouse gases 
among these developments are the united nations framework convention on climate change  also known as the kyoto protocol an internationally applied protocol  which has been ratified in colombia  one of our reporting segments  the regional greenhouse gas initiative or rggi in the northeastern united states  and the western regional climate action initiative in the western united states 
the us congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases  primarily through the development of greenhouse gas cap and trade programs 
in addition  more than one third of the states already have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases 
in  the united states supreme court in massachusetts  et al 
v 
epa  held that carbon dioxide may be regulated as an air pollutant under the federal clean air act 
on december   the epa responded to the massachusetts  et al 
v 
epa decision and issued a finding that the current and projected concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations  and that certain greenhouse gases from motor vehicles contribute to the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and hence to the threat of climate change 
based on these findings  in the epa adopted two sets of regulations that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the federal clean air act  including one that requires a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and another that requires certain construction and operating permit reviews for greenhouse gas emissions from certain large stationary sources 
the stationary source final rule addresses the permitting of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources under the clean air act prevention of significant deterioration construction and title v operating permit programs  pursuant to which these permit programs have been tailored to apply to certain stationary sources of greenhouse gas emissions in a multi step process  with the largest sources first subject to permitting 
in addition  the epa adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gases from certain sources  including  among others  onshore oil and natural gas production facilities 
in april  the epa issued regulations specifically applicable to the oil and gas industry that will require operators to significantly reduce volatile organic compounds  or voc  emissions from natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured through the use of green completions to capture natural gas that would otherwise escape into the air 
the epa also issued regulations that establish standards for voc emissions from several types of equipment at natural gas well sites  including storage tanks  compressors  dehydrators and pneumatic controllers 
although it is not possible at this time to predict whether proposed legislation or regulations will be adopted as initially written  if at all  or how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business  any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions 
any additional costs or operating restrictions associated with legislation or regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows 
in addition  these developments could curtail the demand for fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our clients operate and thus adversely affect demand for our services  which may in turn adversely affect our future results of operations 
finally  we cannot predict with any certainty whether changes to temperature  storm intensity or precipitation patterns as a result of climate change will have a material impact on our operations 
in addition  our business depends on the demand for land drilling and production services from the oil and gas industry and  therefore  is affected by tax  environmental and other laws relating to the oil and gas industry generally  by changes in those laws and by changes in related administrative regulations 
it is possible that these laws and regulations may in the future add significantly to our operating costs or those of our clients  or otherwise directly or indirectly affect our operations 
among the services we provide  we operate as a motor carrier and therefore are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation and by various state agencies 
these regulatory authorities exercise broad powers  governing activities such as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations and regulatory safety 
there are additional regulations specifically relating to the trucking industry  including testing and specification of equipment and product handling requirements 
the trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing truckload services 
some of these possible changes include increasingly stringent environmental regulations  changes in the hours of service regulations which govern the amount of time a driver may drive in any specific period  onboard black box recorder devices or limits on vehicle weight and size 
interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the us department of transportation 
to a large degree  intrastate motor carrier operations are subject to state safety regulations that mirror federal regulations 
such matters as weight and dimension of equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations 
from time to time  various legislative proposals are introduced  including proposals to increase federal  state  or local taxes  including taxes on motor fuels  which may increase our costs or adversely impact the recruitment of drivers 
we cannot predict whether  or in what form  any increase in such taxes applicable to us will be enacted 
federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells that may reduce demand for our drilling and well servicing activities and could adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injection of water  sand  and a minor amount of certain chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon bearing rock formation to allow flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore 
the federal energy policy act of amended the underground injection control provisions of the federal safe drinking water act sdwa to exclude certain hydraulic fracturing practices from the definition of underground injection 
the epa has asserted regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel fuel and has developed draft guidance relating to such practices 
in addition  repeal of the sdwa exclusion of hydraulic fracturing has been advocated by certain advocacy organizations and others in the public 
congress has from time to time considered legislation to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the sdwa  which would have the effect of allowing the epa to promulgate new regulations and permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing  and to require the disclosure of the chemical constituents of hydraulic fracturing fluids to a regulatory agency  which would make the information public via the internet 
scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing activities continues in other ways  with the epa having commenced a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing  the final results of which are expected in in addition  in april  the epa issued the first federal air standards for natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured  which will require operators to significantly reduce voc emissions through the use of green completions to capture natural gas that would otherwise escape into the air 
moreover  the epa is developing effluent limitations for the treatment and discharge of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities and plans to propose these standards by the us department of the interior has also proposed regulations relating to the use of hydraulic fracturing techniques on public lands and disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents 
in addition  some states and localities have adopted  and others are considering adopting  regulations or ordinances that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances  that would require  with some exceptions  disclosure of constituents of hydraulic fracturing fluids  or that would impose higher taxes  fees or royalties on natural gas production 
moreover  public debate over hydraulic fracturing and shale gas production has been increasing  and has resulted in delays of well permits in some areas 
increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition  including litigation  to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques 
additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas  including from the developing shale plays  incurred by our clients 
the adoption of any federal  state or local laws or the implementation of regulations or ordinances restricting or increasing the costs of hydraulic fracturing could cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and natural gas wells and an associated decrease in demand for our drilling and well servicing activities  any or all of which could adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows
