introduction and executive overview we are a diversified manufacturing company focused on print related products 
our broad portfolio of products includes commercial printing  envelope converting  label manufacturing and specialty packaging 
we operate a global network of strategically located manufacturing facilities  serving a diverse base of over  customers 
our business strategy has been and continues to be focused on pursuing strategic acquisitions  improving our cost structure  providing a diverse quality product offering portfolio to our customers and maintaining reasonable levels of financial flexibility 
we believe this strategy has allowed us to diversify our revenue base  maintain our low cost producer focus and deliver quality product offerings to our customers 
see part item of this form k for a more complete description of our business 
overview during  our print and envelope operations have focused on completing the integration of epg into our existing operations  mitigating the decline in direct mail sales due to our financial institution customers decreased demand for customer solicitations and mitigating the decline in our publisher services group revenue due to the decline in the circulation of journals and periodicals 
we believe we are nearing the completion of the integration of epg into our existing operations and our efforts to mitigate sales declines have resulted in new sales opportunities that should partly offset the decline in sales volumes attributable to direct mail and journals and periodicals 
during  our label and packaging operations have focused on enhancing our e commerce customer solutions  enhancing our long run labels business with a focus on prime label capabilities and aligning our operating platform subsequent to the divestiture of two product lines in early we believe these efforts will provide greater sales opportunities for these businesses and provide focus on our growth business lines 
in addition to the operations focus noted above  we recently completed the refinancing and full repayment of our debt maturity 
we began the year with a planned approach to eliminate this debt maturity  and despite a number of challenges  we were able to complete this goal in january for further discussion related to our capital structure and activities taken in to address our debt maturity  see the long term debt section below 
outlook we believe that the mild recovery the general economy experienced in will continue into we believe our efforts to reduce our operating cost structure  which we began implementing at the beginning of the economic downturn  allowed us to mitigate significant impacts to our operating performance and to our business over the past three years 
the print related industries are highly fragmented and extremely competitive 
we believe these factors combined with a slow general economic recovery will continue to impact our results of operations due to open capacity and pricing pressures 
our management focus for is on driving net sales through focused initiatives  investments in our e commerce technology to support expansion across our platform and reduction of our debt by maintaining or improving our cash flow 
our sales focus will be on our top accounts across each of our businesses ensuring we meet our customer demands and work to expand our relationship with them through cross selling initiatives across our platform 
we have implemented a customer relationship management tool within our label and packaging segment and are looking to expand that into our other business lines 
we began these initiatives as well as a few others in and experienced success within our envelope  label and packaging operations as result of their implementation 
we believe these focus points  along with our current customer experience  may allow us to experience modest sales growth despite operating in challenging industries and an uncertain economy 
our e commerce platform is in its infancy and  with minimal investments over the past several years  was in need of enhancement 
we began small yet accurate enhancements of this platform in with a focused approach and small successes to date we have experienced positive results 
for example  our e commerce sales within our label group grew in as compared to in  we are looking to expand our investment  through both capital investments and incremental support headcount  and believe in the future of this platform with our label and packaging operations as well as potential opportunities that may lie within our print and envelope operations 
our deleveraging strategy is still a primary focus 
we have repaid in excess of million in outstanding debt over the past two years 
we believe that despite the industry and economic challenges we experience on a routine basis  we can maintain similar debt repayment trends for the foreseeable future by managing our cash flow and investing strategically in our businesses 
along with debt reduction  we believe there is an opportunity for us to reduce our average interest rate as we seek to pay down the unsecured loan we used to address our maturity and explore opportunities for lower interest rates on our first lien debt 
lower cash interest rates will further improve our cash flow over the next several years as we would not encounter another sizeable debt maturity until lastly  we will continue to monitor our cost structure as marketplace conditions warrant and explore consolidation opportunities that may present themselves 
we will also continue to focus on strategic investments  capital expenditure and acquisition  in areas that further strengthen our manufacturing platform and product offerings while reviewing strategic alternatives for business lines we believe are underperforming or non strategic to our future operations 
acquisitions in august of  we completed the acquisition of nesbitt 
nesbitt is a niche content management business that focuses on high end book content development and project management offerings and was acquired to further enhance our content management operations 
additionally  we expect that nesbitt will enable us to provide additional cross selling opportunities to our existing customer base 
in february of  we acquired the assets of epg 
epg manufactures and distributes envelope products for the billing  financial  direct mail and office products markets 
we believe epg strengthened our envelope operations and has provided manufacturing efficiencies given epg asset base and geographic overlap of facilities between epg and our pre existing envelope operations 
in november of  we completed the acquisition of gilbreth 
gilbreth utilizes specialized printing technologies as a manufacturer and marketer of full body shrink sleeves and tamper evident neck bands 
the acquisition of gilbreth expands our label product portfolio and allowed us to internally produce product that we historically had to purchase from an outsourced partner 
additionally  we expect that gilbreth will enable us to provide additional cross selling opportunities to our existing customer base 
in may of  we completed the acquisition of glyph  which we believe enhanced our content management operations 
in february of  we completed the acquisition of clixx 
clixx has provided our canadian print operations with end of production capabilities that we previously lacked 
discontinued operations in  we began exploring our opportunities to divest certain non strategic or underperforming businesses within our manufacturing platform 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of  the financial results of our documents and forms business as well as our wide format papers business were accounted for as discontinued operations  which we refer to collectively as the discontinued operations  resulting in our historical consolidated balance sheets  statement of operations and comprehensive income loss and statement of cash flows being reclassified to reflect these discontinued operations separately from our continuing operations 
in february of  we completed the sale of our documents group 
net cash proceeds were approximately million 
in january of  we completed the sale of our wide format papers business and received proceeds of approximately million 
reportable segments in the first quarter of  we realigned our reportable segments as a result of the sale of the discontinued operations combined with the realignment of management responsibilities 
previously  we reported our segments as envelopes  forms and labels and commercial printing 
beginning january   we realigned our segments into two complementary reportable segments the print and envelope segment and the label and packaging segment 
deferred taxes in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a non cash valuation allowance charge of million related to the realizability of our net deferred tax assets due to excess capacity and pricing pressure combined with the recent decline in net sales from our print and envelope segment during goodwill and intangible asset impairments in we did not record any goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded non cash goodwill impairment charges of million related to the discontinued operations 
these charges were due to our carrying value of the assets  including goodwill and intangible assets  of the discontinued operations being in excess of the fair value we received from divesting these businesses 
during the third quarter of  given the continued economic uncertainty that remained in the united states and global economies at the time and revisions to our forecasted operating results within our print and envelope segment 
we believed that there were sufficient indicators that would require us to perform an interim goodwill and long lived asset impairment analysis as of october  as a result of our goodwill and long lived asset impairment analysis  we recorded non cash impairment charges of million related to goodwill and million related to other long lived assets  of which million related to an indefinite lived tradename and million related to customer relationships 
we believe that these charges primarily resulted from reductions in the estimated fair value of this reporting unit due to i higher discount rates applied to lower estimated future cash flows as compared to our prior year analysis  and ii continued economic uncertainty  which has increased customer cost awareness resulting in continued price pressures  lower page counts  and a shift from historical web and sheet fed print products to lower cost digital print products 
consolidated operating results this md a includes an overview of our consolidated results of operations for  and followed by a discussion of the results of operations of each of our reportable segments for the same periods 
our results for the year ended include the operating results of epg and nesbitt for less than a full twelve months 
our results of operations for the year ended include the operating results of gilbreth  clixx and glyph  subsequent to their respective acquisition dates

gain on bargain purchase during  in connection with the acquisition of epg  we recognized a bargain purchase gain of approximately million 
interest expense interest expense decreased million to million in  as compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to the lower average outstanding debt balances primarily as a result of debt repayments using cash flow from operations and the proceeds from the sale of the discontinued operations  offset in part by higher interest expense as a result of our refinancing activities in interest expense in reflected average outstanding debt of approximately billion and a weighted average interest rate of  as compared to average outstanding debt of billion and a weighted average interest rate of in we expect interest expense in will be higher than primarily due to non cash interest charges associated with the amortization of deferred debt issuance costs that we capitalized in interest expense decreased million to million in  from million in the decrease was primarily due to the redemption of higher cost interest rate swaps  partially offset by higher average outstanding debt balances primarily resulting from the epg acquisition 
interest expense in reflected average outstanding debt of approximately billion and a weighted average interest rate of  as compared to average outstanding debt of billion and a weighted average interest rate of in loss gain on early extinguishment of debt during  in connection with refinancing activities  we incurred a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million  of which million related to tender and consent fees paid to consenting lenders and million related to the write off of previously unamortized debt issuance costs 
the loss on early extinguishment was partially offset by the gains on early extinguishment of debt of million related to the repurchase of million of our senior subordinated notes  due  which we refer to as the notes  million of our senior notes due  which we refer to as the notes  and million of our senior subordinated notes due  which we refer to as the notes  plus in each case accrued and unpaid interest thereon 
during  we repurchased million of our notes for million plus accrued and unpaid interest and million of our notes  for million plus accrued and unpaid interest 
as a result  we recognized gains on early extinguishment of debt of million 
during  in connection with our refinancing activities  we incurred a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million of which million related to fees paid to consenting lenders and million related to the write off of previously unamortized debt issuance costs 
income taxes years ended in thousands income tax expense benefit from us operations income tax expense benefit from foreign operations income tax expense benefit effective income tax rate in  we had an income tax expense of million and our effective tax rate in was higher than the federal statutory rate  primarily due to a non cash valuation allowance charge related to our net deferred tax assets 
we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly in the next twelve months 
we review the likelihood that we will realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets and therefore the need for valuation allowances on a quarterly basis  or more frequently if events indicate that a review is required 
in determining the requirement for a valuation allowance  the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or consolidated group recording the net deferred tax asset is considered  along with all other available positive and negative evidence 
the factors considered in our determination of the probability of the realization of the deferred tax assets include  but are not limited to recent historical financial results  historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences  the duration of statutory carryforward periods and tax planning strategies 
if  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance is recorded 
concluding that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is significant negative evidence which is objective and verifiable  such as cumulative losses in recent years 
we utilize a rolling twelve quarters of pre tax income or loss adjusted for significant permanent book to tax differences as a measure of our cumulative results in recent years 
in the united states  our analysis indicates that we have cumulative three year historical losses on this basis 
while there are significant impairment  restructuring and refinancing charges driving our cumulative three year loss  this is considered significant negative evidence which is objective and verifiable and therefore  difficult to overcome 
however  the three year loss position is not solely determinative and accordingly  we consider all other available positive and negative evidence in our analysis 
based upon our analysis  which incorporated the excess capacity and pricing pressure we have experienced in our product lines  along with the recent decline in net sales from our print and envelope segment during  we believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets in the united states may not be fully realized in the future 
accordingly  we estimated and recorded a valuation allowance related to those net deferred tax assets of million in deferred tax assets related to certain state net operating losses and foreign tax credit carryforwards also did not reach the more likely than not realizability criteria and accordingly  were subject to a valuation allowance 
during  our valuation allowance related to these state net operating losses and foreign tax credit carryforwards was reduced by million to million  primarily as a result of the expiration of foreign tax credit carryforwards 
we believe that we ultimately will recover the remaining net deferred tax assets based upon completed cost restructuring activities and modifications we have made to our capital structure that will result in future taxable income 
there is no corresponding income tax benefit recognized with respect to losses incurred and no corresponding income tax expense recognized with respect to earnings generated in jurisdictions with a valuation allowance 
this causes variability in our effective tax rate 
we intend to maintain the valuation allowances until it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized 
if operating results improve or deteriorate on a sustained basis  or if certain tax planning strategies are implemented  our conclusions regarding the need for valuation allowances could change  resulting in either the reversal or increase of the valuation allowances in the future  which could have a significant impact on income tax expense in the period recognized and subsequent periods 
in  we had an income tax expense of million  which primarily related to income tax on our domestic operations as well as taxes related to non deductible expenses mainly attributable to employee and stock compensation 
our effective tax rate during was higher than the federal statutory rate  primarily due to the non deductibility for income tax purposes of certain employee and stock related compensation  partially offset by a release of valuation allowance for a portion of our state income tax loss carryforwards 
in  we had an income tax benefit of million  which primarily related to income tax benefits from our non cash impairment charges related to goodwill and other long lived assets and the reversal of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as well as taxes on our domestic operations 
our effective tax benefit rate during was lower than the federal statutory rate  primarily due to the non deductibility for income tax purposes of the non cash impairment charges related to goodwill and other long lived assets 
loss income from discontinued operations  net of taxes discontinued operations represents the results of operations  including tax effects of our discontinued operations 
the results for include the loss on sale of our discontinued operations of million  net of a tax benefit of million 
income from discontinued operations of million  net of taxes of million for  include the reduction of a liability of million  net of tax expense of million  due to the expiration of certain statutes of limitations related to the supremex income fund  which we refer to as the fund 
the results for include a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million  which had no tax effect as it was non deductible goodwill 
there is no allocation of interest expense on our debt within our discontinued operations results 
income from discontinued operations for also includes the reduction of our liability for uncertain tax positions of million  net of deferred tax assets of million  as a result of the expiration of certain statute of limitations on uncertain tax positions related to the fund

corporate expenses were higher by million  or  in  as compared to  primarily due to higher compensation related expenses and lower vendor related discounts  offset in part by lower restructuring and impairment charges from our cost savings initiatives 
restructuring  impairment and other charges we currently have two active cost savings  restructuring and integration plans i the plan related to the implementation of cost savings initiatives along with the closure and consolidations of a print plant and an envelope plant  which we refer to as the plan  and ii the plan related to the integration of the epg acquisition  which we refer to as the epg plan 
we currently have six residual cost savings  restructuring and integration plans i the plan implemented by the print and envelope and the label and packaging segments for further cost savings initiatives  which we refer to as the other restructuring plans  ii the plans related to the integration of the nashua corporation and glyph acquisitions  collectively with the epg plan we refer to as the acquisition integration plans  and iii the cost savings and restructuring plan  the cost savings and integration plan and the cost savings and restructuring plan  which collectively with the other restructuring plans we refer to as the residual plans 
during  we continued the integration of our epg acquisition and announced the closure and consolidation of a manufacturing facility 
we also implemented the plan  which included the announcement of the closure and consolidations of a print and an envelope plant into our existing operations 
additionally  we began implementing a cost savings initiative  which primarily focused on our print and envelope segment and our corporate expenses 
this initiative was focused on consolidation of office and warehouse space and other overhead cost elimination plans  including targeted headcount reductions of approximately employees 
we expect to be substantially complete with the plan in we are substantially complete with the acquisition integration plans but may have additional closures or consolidation due to epg 
we have completed the implementation of the residual plans 
during  as a result of our restructuring and integration activities  we incurred million of restructuring  impairment and other charges  which included million of employee separation costs  asset impairments  net of million  equipment moving expenses of million  lease termination expenses of million  multi employer pension withdrawal expenses of million and building clean up and other expenses of million

as of the year ended  our total restructuring liability was million  of which million is included in other current liabilities and million  which is expected to be paid through  is included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
our multi employer pension withdrawal liabilities are million of our remaining restructuring liabilities 
we believe these liabilities represent our anticipated ultimate withdrawal liabilities  however  we are exposed to significant risks and uncertainties arising from our participation in these multi employer pension plans 
while it is not possible to quantify the potential impact of our future actions or the future actions of other participating employers from the multi employer pension plans for which we have exited  our anticipated ultimate withdrawal liabilities may be significantly impacted in the future due to lower future contributions or increased withdrawals from other participating employers 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations 
net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was million in  which was primarily due to our net loss adjusted for non cash items of million  offset by a use of working capital of million and pension and post retirement plan contributions  net of pension expense  of million 
the use of working capital primarily resulted from i a decrease in other working capital changes primarily due to the timing of interest payments on our outstanding debt and a payment of a litigation settlement  and ii a decrease in accounts payable due to the timing of vendor payments 
these uses of working capital were offset in part by a decrease in accounts receivables due to the timing of collections from and sales to our customers 
cash provided by operating activities is generally sufficient to meet daily disbursement needs 
on days when our cash receipts exceed disbursements  we reduce our revolving credit balance or place excess funds in conservative  short term investments until there is an opportunity to pay down debt 
on days when our cash disbursements exceed cash receipts  we use invested cash balances and or our revolving credit to fund the difference 
as a result  our daily revolving credit balance fluctuates depending on working capital needs 
regardless  at all times we believe we have sufficient liquidity available to us to fund our cash needs 
net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was million in  which was primarily due to our net income adjusted for non cash items of million and a source of working capital of million  offset by pension and post retirement plan contributions  net of pension expense  of million 
the source of working capital primarily resulted from i an increase in accounts payable due to the timing of vendor payments  and ii a decrease in our inventories primarily due to our inventory management initiative  which began in the third quarter of these increases were offset in part by i a decrease in other working capital changes primarily due to the timing of customer related payments and the timing of interest payments on our outstanding debt  and ii an increase in our accounts receivables due to the timing of collections from and sales to our customers 
net cash used in provided by operating activities of discontinued operations 
represents the net cash used in provided by the discontinued operations operating activities 
net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations 
net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations was million in  primarily resulting from capital expenditures of million and million of cash consideration for the acquisition of nesbitt related to working capital settlement provisions 
these uses of cash were offset in part by proceeds received from the sale of property  plant and equipment of million and proceeds received from the sale of assets of million 
our debt agreements limit capital expenditures to million in plus any proceeds received from the sale of property  plant and equipment and  if certain conditions are satisfied  any unused permitted amounts from we estimate that we will spend approximately million on capital expenditures in  before considering proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment 
our primary sources for our capital expenditures are cash generated from operations  proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment  and financing capacity within our current debt arrangements 
these sources of funding are consistent with prior years funding of our capital expenditures 
net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations was million in  primarily resulting from million of cash consideration for the acquisitions of epg and nesbitt and capital expenditures of million  offset in part by million of proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment 
net cash provided by used in investing activities of discontinued operations 
represents the net cash provided by used in discontinued operations related to investing activities 
in  the cash provided by discontinued investing activities relates to net cash proceeds of approximately million from the sale of the discontinued operations 
net cash used in financing activities of continuing operations 
net cash used in financing activities of continuing operations was million in  primarily due to refinancing activities  including the issuance of million and million aggregate principal amounts of additional term loans in december and june  respectively  which we refer to as the term loan add on  the repayment of million of term loans primarily as a result of a required excess cash flow sweep and the open market repurchases and retirements of our notes  notes and notes  of approximately million  million and million  respectively  for million  million and million  respectively  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
these refinancing activities also included i the repayment of million of our notes  million of our notes  and million of our notes  ii the payment of million of tender and consent fees and related transaction costs  iii the issuance of our million senior notes due  which we refer to as the notes  with an original issuance discount of million  iv the issuance of our million senior exchangeable notes due  which we refer to as the notes  and v repayment of other long term debt 
these decreases were offset by i proceeds from the issuance of our notes  ii proceeds from the issuance of our notes  and iii borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  primarily due to i the repayment of million of our term loan b due  ii open market purchases of our notes and notes of million and million  respectively  iii repayment of other long term debt of million  and iv fees paid to consenting lenders of million related to the refinancing activities 
net cash used in financing activities of discontinued operations 
represents the net cash used in discontinued operations related to financing activities 
in  the cash used in discontinued financing activities relates to fees paid by us to amend our credit facilities of million 
contractual obligations and other commitments 
the following table details our significant contractual obligations and other commitments as of the year ended in thousands payments due long term debt operating leases other total thereafter total includes million of estimated interest expense over the term of our long term debt  with variable rate debt having an average interest rate of approximately 
includes pension and other postretirement contributions of million  anticipated worker s compensation paid losses of million  restructuring related liabilities of million  including interest expense on lease terminations and multi employer pension withdrawal liabilities  and purchase commitments for equipment of million 
excluded from the table are million income tax contingencies as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount payable or timing of settlement 
long term debt 
our total outstanding long term debt  including current maturities  was approximately billion as of the year ended  a decrease of million from this decrease was primarily due to cash flow from operations and proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations  partially offset by fees paid for refinancing activities in as of the year ended  approximately of our debt outstanding was subject to fixed interest rates 
as of february   we had approximately million borrowing availability under our million revolving credit facility due  which we refer to as our revolving credit facility 
from time to time we may refinance our debt obligations as business needs and market conditions warrant 
on december   we announced that we had initiated a mandatory and irrevocable redemption of all of the outstanding notes 
pursuant to the terms of the indenture  governing the notes  the notes were redeemed on january   which we refer to as the redemption date  at a redemption price of of the unpaid principal amount of the notes  together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon up to the redemption date 
on december   we issued million aggregate principal amount of additional term loans  which we refer to as the million term loan add on  under our senior secured credit agreement  which includes the revolving credit facility and a million term loan due  which we refer to as the term loan b collectively with the term loan add on and revolving credit facility  we refer to the credit facilities 
the million term loan add on was issued at par 
concurrently with the million term loan add on  we amended the credit facilities  which we refer to as the december amendment  to allow us to incur up to million of indebtedness under a new unsecured term loan to be prepaid on substantially similar terms as our notes  subject to maintaining certain liquidity thresholds and other customary conditions 
we capitalized debt issuance costs of million  which will be amortized over the remaining life of the credit facilities 
consenting lenders received million  which was capitalized and will be amortized over the remaining life of the credit facilities 
on june   we issued an additional term loan in the principal amount of million  which we refer to as the million term loan add on  under our credit facilities 
the million term loan add on was issued at a discount of approximately million 
concurrently with the million term loan add on  we amended the credit facilities  which we refer to as the add on amendment  to allow for the repurchase of up to million of our notes  subject to maintaining certain liquidity thresholds and other customary conditions 
we capitalized debt issuance costs of million  which will be amortized over the remaining life of the credit facilities 
consenting lenders received million for the add on amendment  of which million was capitalized and will be amortized over the remaining life of our credit facilities 
on march   we issued million aggregate principal amount of our notes that were sold with registration rights to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with rule a under the securities act of  and to certain non us persons in accordance with regulation s under the securities act of the notes were issued at a discount of approximately million  of which million remains unamortized as of the year ended the notes were issued pursuant to an indenture  which we refer to as the indenture  among us  certain subsidiary guarantors and us bank national association  as trustee 
we will pay interest on the notes semi annually  in cash in arrears  on may and november of each year  commencing may  the notes have no required principal payments prior to their maturity on may  the notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by us and substantially all of our existing and future north american subsidiaries 
as such  the notes rank pari passu with all of our existing and future senior debt and senior to any of our subordinated debt 
we may redeem the notes  in whole or in part  on or after may   at redemption prices ranging from to  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
in addition  at any time prior to may   we may redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of the notes originally issued with the net cash proceeds of certain public equity offerings  at a redemption price of plus accrued and unpaid interest 
we may also redeem some or all of the notes before may  at a redemption price of of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the redemption date  plus a make whole premium 
each holder of the notes has the right to require us to repurchase such holder notes at a purchase price of of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon  upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the indenture that constitute a change of control 
the indenture contains a number of covenants that  among other things  restrict  subject to certain exceptions  our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries  to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness  make restricted payments including paying dividends on  redeeming or repurchasing our capital stock  permit restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions or payments  dispose of assets  make investments  grant liens on assets  merge or consolidate or transfer certain assets  and enter into transactions with affiliates 
the indenture also contains certain customary affirmative covenants 
in order to fulfill our registration rights obligations  on may   we launched a registered exchange offer  which we refer to as the exchange offer  to exchange any and all of our unregistered notes for publicly tradable notes having substantially identical terms  except for the elimination of some transfer restrictions  registration rights and additional interest payments relating to the outstanding notes 
the exchange offer expired on june  concurrently with the issuance of the notes  we issued million aggregate principal amount of our notes that were sold to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with rule a under the securities act of the notes were issued pursuant to an indenture  which we refer to as the indenture  among us  certain subsidiary guarantors and us bank national association  as trustee 
we will pay interest on the notes semi annually  in cash in arrears  on may and november of each year  commencing november  the notes have no required principal payments prior to their maturity on may  the notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by us and substantially all of our existing and future north american subsidiaries 
as such  the notes rank pari passu with all of our existing and future senior debt and senior to any of our subordinated debt 
we may not redeem the notes at our option 
upon a fundamental change  as defined in the indenture  each holder of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of such holder notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased  plus any accrued and unpaid interest to  but excluding  the fundamental change repurchase date  as defined in the indenture 
the indenture does not contain any financial covenants or any restrictions  among other things  on the payment of dividends  the incurrence of other indebtedness  or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us 
the indenture does not contain any covenants or other provisions to protect holders of the notes in the event of a highly leveraged transaction or a change of control  except to the extent described in the indenture 
the notes are exchangeable at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date for shares of our common stock at an exchange rate of shares per  principal amount of notes  which is equal to an exchange price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment under certain specified circumstances 
this represents a premium of above the last reported sale price of our common stock on the new york stock exchange on thursday  march   which was per share 
if a holder elects to exchange notes in connection with a make whole fundamental change  as described in the indenture  such holder may also be entitled to receive a make whole premium upon exchange in certain circumstances 
net proceeds of the notes and notes together with borrowings under our revolving credit facility were used to fund the cash tender offers for any and all of our notes and notes  plus million aggregate principal amount of our notes and to repurchase an additional million of notes through open market  negotiated purchases to refinance such indebtedness  and to pay related fees and expenses 
in connection with the issuance of the notes and the notes  we capitalized debt issuance costs of million and million  respectively  all of which will be amortized over the life of the notes and the notes 
effective march   we increased our borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility to million from million as a result of receiving an additional commitment  as permitted under the credit facilities 
in connection with this increase  we capitalized debt issuance costs of million  which will be amortized over the life of the revolving credit facility 
on march   we repaid million of term loan b as part of our required excess cash flow pre payment 
on february   we amended our credit facilities  which we refer to as the amendment  to increase our restricted dispositions basket in connection with the sale of the documents group 
the amendment required that of the net proceeds of such sale be used to repay the term loan b and required that the remaining amount be used to reinvest in our business or refinance certain existing debt 
on february   we repaid million of the term loan b in connection with this provision 
the amendment required us to prepay unsecured debt  second lien debt and or the loans under the credit facilities within days after the effective date of the amendment  in an amount equal to of the net proceeds 
in connection with the amendment we paid million to consenting lenders and related fees 
note repurchases in  we purchased in the open market approximately million of our notes and retired them for million plus accrued and unpaid interest 
in connection with the retirement  we recorded a gain on early extinguishment of debt of million  which includes the write off of million of unamortized debt issuance costs 
in  we purchased in the open market approximately million and million of our notes and notes  respectively  and retired them for million and million  respectively  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
credit facilities and debt compliance the credit facilities contain certain restrictions that  among other things and with certain exceptions  limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  prepay other debt  transfer assets outside of cenveo  pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock 
the credit facilities also contain customary financial covenants  including a maximum consolidated leverage covenant  a maximum consolidated first lien leverage covenant and a minimum consolidated interest coverage covenant 
additionally  pursuant to the december amendment  the interest rate margin for all loans under the credit facilities increased to i from per annum for london interbank offered rate libor based loans and ii from per annum for prime rate loans 
a libor floor of for the revolving credit facility was also established 
the december amendment also modified the financial covenants  including i increasing the maximum consolidated first lien leverage ratio covenant to x with a step down to x in the first quarter of and to x in the first quarter of  ii delaying a step down in the maximum consolidated leverage ratio from x to x until the fourth quarter of and from x to x until the third quarter of  and iii delaying a step up in the minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio from x to x until the first quarter of the obligations under the credit facilities are guaranteed by us and each existing and future direct and indirect domestic subsidiary of cenveo 
the credit facilities are secured by a first priority perfected security interest in substantially all assets of cenveo and our domestic subsidiaries 
as the credit facilities have senior secured and first priority lien position in our capital structure and the most restrictive covenants  then provided we are in compliance with the credit facilities  we would also be in compliance  in most circumstances  with our debt incurrence tests within all of our debt indentures 
any default under the credit facilities would prevent us from borrowing additional amounts and could cause the indebtedness outstanding under the credit facilities and  by reason of cross acceleration or cross default provisions  all of the aforementioned notes and any other indebtedness we may then have  to become immediately due and payable 
as of the year ended  we were in compliance with all debt agreement covenants 
we anticipate being in compliance with all debt agreement covenants through our fiscal year ending subsequent events on january   we entered into an unsecured credit agreement  which we refer to as the unsecured credit agreement  with macquarie us trading llc  as administrative agent  whom we refer to as the administrative agent  and the lenders named therein  which provides for an unsecured million aggregate principal amount term loan due march   which we refer to as the unsecured term loan 
in connection with the unsecured credit agreement we capitalized debt issuance costs of million in in connection with the unsecured credit agreement  all of our domestic subsidiaries other than cenveo corporation as guarantors  entered into a guaranty agreement  dated as of january   which we refer to as the guaranty  in favor of the administrative agent 
proceeds from the unsecured term loan together with borrowings on our revolving credit facility were used to redeem  satisfy and discharge in full the notes  and to pay certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the unsecured credit agreement and the redemption  satisfaction and discharge of the notes 
on january   us bank national association  the trustee for the notes officially canceled the notes 
the unsecured term loan bears interest at a rate of per annum  payable quarterly in arrears on the th day of each february  may  august and november prior to the maturity of the unsecured term loan and on the maturity date of the unsecured term loan 
if we do not pay in full a quarterly excess cash flow mandatory prepayment pursuant to the terms of the unsecured credit agreement  interest on the outstanding principal amount of the unsecured term loan will instead accrue at per annum until the first prepayment date thereafter when the full excess cash flow mandatory prepayment is made 
in addition  for so long as the increased interest rate pursuant to the previous sentence is not applicable  if on any interest payment date the outstanding principal amount of the unsecured term loan exceeds a specified threshold amount  which threshold amount equals million on may  and decreases by million on each interest payment date thereafter  then on and after each such interest payment date an additional per annum will accrue on such excess 
the unsecured credit agreement is guaranteed by us and each existing and future direct and indirect domestic subsidiary of cenveo on an unsecured basis pursuant to the guaranty 
the unsecured credit agreement contains customary covenants that  among other things  place limits on our ability to incur debt  create liens  make investments and acquisitions  sell assets  pay dividends  prepay debt  merge with other entities or sell all or substantially all of our assets  engage in transactions with affiliates  and make capital expenditures 
the unsecured credit agreement also contains customary representations and warranties and events of default 
letters of credit as of the year ended  we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately million related to performance and payment guarantees 
based on our experience with these arrangements  we do not believe that any obligations that may arise will be significant 
credit ratings our current credit ratings are as follows rating agency corporate rating credit facilities notes notes outlook last update moody s b ba b caa negative december standard poor s b bb b ccc negative december in december  moody investors services  which we refer to as moody  reaffirmed our corporate rating and the ratings on our credit facilities  notes and notes 
the detail of our current ratings have been provided in the table above 
in december  standard poor ratings services  which we refer to as standard poor  reaffirmed our corporate rating and the ratings on our credit facilities  notes and notes 
the detail of our current ratings have been provided in the table above 
the terms of our existing debt do not have any rating triggers that impact our funding availability or influence our daily operations  including planned capital expenditures 
we do not believe that our current ratings will unduly influence our ability to raise additional capital if and or when needed 
some of our constituents closely track rating agency actions and would note any raising or lowering of our credit ratings  however  we believe that along with reviewing our credit ratings  additional quantitative and qualitative analysis must be performed to accurately judge our financial condition 
we expect that our internally generated cash flows and financing available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs for the next twelve months  however  this cannot be assured 
off balance sheet arrangements 
it is not our business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements 
accordingly  as of the years ended and  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting matters the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on historical experience and on various other factors which we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from estimates 
we believe that the following represent our more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for losses on accounts receivable 
we maintain a valuation allowance based on the expected collectability of our accounts receivable  which requires a considerable amount of judgment in assessing the current creditworthiness of customers and related aging of past due balances 
as of the years ended and  the allowance provided for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable was million and million  respectively 
charges for bad debts recorded to the statement of operations for the years ended  and were million  million and million  respectively 
we cannot guarantee that our current credit losses will be consistent with those in the past 
these estimates may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have overstated or understated the allowance for losses required for uncollectible accounts receivable 
inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on a first in  first out or average cost basis 
cost includes materials  labor and overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories 
when there is a significant decrease in demand for our products and market price is below cost  we are required to reduce our inventory balances accordingly 
provision for impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of specific assets or group of assets may not be recoverable 
when an evaluation is required  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows associated with the specific asset or group of assets 
if the cost of the asset or group of assets cannot be recovered by these undiscounted cash flows  we would assess the fair value of the asset or asset group and if necessary  an impairment charge would be recorded 
our estimates of future cash flows are based on our experience and internal business plans 
our internal business plans require judgments regarding future economic conditions  product demand and pricing 
during  and  in connection with our restructuring and integration programs  we recorded non cash impairment charges  net on long lived assets of million  million and million  respectively 
our non cash impairment charges include a million non cash impairment charge related to customer relationships within our print and envelope segment 
although we believe our estimates are appropriate  significant differences in the actual performance of an asset or group of assets may materially affect our evaluation of the recoverability of the asset values currently recorded 
additional impairment charges may be necessary in future years 
provision for impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually at the beginning of december and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred 
accounting standards codification asc  goodwill and other intangible assets  provides us with the option of performing a qualitative assessment  if elected  prior to calculating the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset or the fair value of a reporting unit for goodwill under a quantitative approach 
if we determine  based on qualitative factors  the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset or the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not to be less than the respective carrying value  a quantitative impairment test would be required to be performed 
otherwise  further impairment testing would not be needed 
asc prescribes a two step quantitative method for determining goodwill impairment 
in the first step  we compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value  step two is completed to determine the amount of the impairment loss 
step two requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets  including any unrecognized intangible assets  and liabilities in a hypothetical purchase price allocation 
any remaining unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to the corresponding carrying value of goodwill to compute the goodwill impairment amount 
as part of our quantitative impairment analysis for each reporting unit  we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit  primarily using the income approach 
the income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit  including projected future operating results  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  discount rates  and the allocation of shared service or corporate items 
the market approach was used as a test of reasonableness of the conclusions reached in the income approach 
the market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping 
the determination of the fair value of the reporting units and the allocation of that value to individual assets and liabilities within those reporting units requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to the selection of appropriate peer group companies  control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete  the discount rate  terminal growth rates  and forecasts of net sales  operating income  depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures 
the allocation requires several analyses to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities including  among others  trade names  customer relationships  and property  plant and equipment 
although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable  actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates 
changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units  the amount of the goodwill impairment charge  or both 
we also compared the sum of the estimated fair values of the reporting units to our total enterprise value as implied by the market value of our equity securities 
this comparison indicated that  in total  our assumptions and estimates were reasonable 
however  future declines in the overall market value of our equity securities may indicate that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below their carrying value 
in  we elected to bypass the qualitative only assessment and perform quantitative assessments on both goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
we did not record any goodwill or indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charges 
in  we allocated approximately million of goodwill to the discontinued operations based on a relative fair value allocation 
as a result of our relative fair value calculation for these businesses  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million in discontinued operations  net of taxes on the consolidated statement of operations 
in  we recorded non cash goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charges of million  of which million related to goodwill and million related to an indefinite lived trade name within our print and envelope segment 
one measure of the sensitivity of the amount of goodwill impairment charges to key assumptions is the amount by which each reporting unit had fair value in excess of its carrying amount or had carrying amount in excess of fair value for the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
in  our four reporting units had fair value in excess of carrying value with fair value exceeding carrying value by at least 
generally  changes in estimates of expected future cash flows would have a similar effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
that is  a change in estimated future cash flows would decrease the estimated fair value of the reporting unit by approximately 
of the other key assumptions that impact the estimated fair values  most reporting units have the greatest sensitivity to changes in the estimated discount rate 
in  the discount rate for each reporting unit was estimated to be 
a basis point increase in our estimated discount rates would not have resulted in any additional reporting units failing step one 
determining whether an impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets has occurred requires an analysis of the fair value of each of the related trade names 
however  if our estimates of the valuations of our trade names prove to be inaccurate  an impairment charge could be necessary in future periods 
our quantitative impairment analysis for trade names utilizes a relief from royalty method in which the hypothetical benefits of owning each respective trade name are valued by discounting hypothetical royalty revenue over projected revenues covered by the trade names 
we utilized royalty rates of to for the use of the subject trade names based on comparable market rates  the profitability of the product employing the trade name  and qualitative factors  such as the strength of the name and years in usage 
we utilized a discount rate of  which was based on the weighted average cost of capital for the respective business plus a premium to account for the relative risks of the subject trade name 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations for all of our indefinite lived trade names  we applied hypothetical and decreases to the estimated fair value of our trade names 
such hypothetical decreases in fair value could be due to changes in discount rates and or assumed royalty rates 
these hypothetical and decreases in estimated fair value would not have resulted in an impairment of any of our identifiable indefinite lived trade names 
self insurance reserves 
we are self insured for the majority of our workers compensation and health insurance costs  subject to specific retention levels 
we rely on claims experience and the advice of consulting actuaries and administrators in determining an adequate liability for self insurance claims 
while we believe that the estimates of our self insurance liabilities are reasonable  significant differences in our experience or a significant change in any of our assumptions could materially affect the amount of workers compensation and healthcare expenses we record on an annual basis 
our self insurance workers compensation liability is estimated based on reserves for claims that are established by a third party administrator 
the estimate of these reserves is adjusted from time to time to reflect the estimated future development of the claims 
our liability for workers compensation claims is the estimated total cost of the claims on a fully developed and discounted basis that considers anticipated payment patterns 
as of the years ended and  the undiscounted liability was million and million  respectively  and the discounted liability was million and million  respectively  using discount rates of and  respectively 
our self insured healthcare liability represents our estimate of claims that have been incurred  but not reported as of the years ended and we rely on claims experience and the advice of consulting actuaries to determine an adequate liability for self insured plans 
this liability was million and million as of the years ended and  respectively  and was estimated based on an analysis of actuarial completion factors that estimated incurred but unreported liabilities derived from the historical claims experience 
the estimate of our liability for employee healthcare represents between and days of unreported claims 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery has occurred  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
since a significant portion of our products are customer specific  it is common for our customers to inspect the quality of the product at our facilities prior to shipment 
products shipped are not subject to contractual right of return provisions 
we record sales net of applicable sales tax and freight costs that are included in the price of the product and are included in net sales while the costs of delivering finished goods to customers are recorded as freight costs and included in cost of sales 
accounting for income taxes 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate  which primarily includes the united states  canada and india 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
the tax effects of these temporary differences are recorded as deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded an expense in our consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax items that have been deducted for tax purposes  but have not yet been recorded as an expense in our consolidated financial statements 
as of the years ended and  we had net deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively  from our united states operations 
the change in united states net deferred taxes is primarily due to the recording of a valuation allowance of million in as of the years ended and  we had foreign net deferred tax liabilities of million and million  respectively 
we review the likelihood that we will realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets and therefore the need for valuation allowances on a quarterly basis  or more frequently if events indicate that a review is required 
in determining the requirement for a valuation allowance  the historical and projected financial results of the legal entity or consolidated group recording the net deferred tax asset is considered  along with all other available positive and negative evidence 
the factors considered in our determination of the probability of the realization of the deferred tax assets include  but are not limited to recent historical financial results  historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences  the duration of statutory carryforward periods and tax planning strategies 
if  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance is recorded 
concluding that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is significant negative evidence which is objective and verifiable  such as cumulative losses in recent years 
we utilize a rolling twelve quarters of pre tax income or loss adjusted for significant permanent book to tax differences as a measure of our cumulative results in recent years 
in the united states  our analysis indicates that we have cumulative three year historical losses on this basis 
while there are significant impairment  restructuring and refinancing charges driving our cumulative three year loss  this is considered significant negative evidence which is objective and verifiable and therefore  difficult to overcome 
however  the three year loss position is not solely determinative and accordingly  we consider all other available positive and negative evidence in our analysis 
based upon our analysis  which incorporated the excess capacity and pricing pressure we have experienced in our product lines  along with the recent decline in net sales from our print and envelope segment during  we believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets in the united states may not be fully realized in the future 
accordingly  we estimated and recorded a valuation allowance related to those net deferred tax assets of million in deferred tax assets related to certain state net operating losses and foreign tax credit carryforwards also did not reach the more likely than not realizability criteria and accordingly  were subject to a valuation allowance 
during  our valuation allowance related to these state net operating losses and foreign tax credit carryforwards was reduced by million to million  primarily as a result of the expiration of foreign tax credit carryforwards 
we believe that we ultimately will recover the remaining net deferred tax assets based upon completed cost restructuring activities and modifications we have made to our capital structure that will result in future taxable income 
there is no corresponding income tax benefit recognized with respect to losses incurred and no corresponding income tax expense recognized with respect to earnings generated in jurisdictions with a valuation allowance 
this causes variability in our effective tax rate 
we intend to maintain the valuation allowances until it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized 
if operating results improve or deteriorate on a sustained basis  or if certain tax planning strategies are implemented  our conclusions regarding the need for valuation allowances could change  resulting in either the reversal or increase of the valuation allowances in the future  which could have a significant impact on income tax expense in the period recognized and subsequent periods 
we recognize a tax position in our consolidated financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
this recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  the final outcome of uncertain tax positions may be materially different from that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
we adjust such reserves upon changes in circumstances that would cause a change to the estimate of the ultimate liability  upon effective settlement or upon the expiration of the statute of limitations  in the period in which such event occurs 
during and  we did not reduce our liabilities for uncertain tax positions 
pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
we record annual amounts relating to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on calculations which include various actuarial assumptions including discount rates  anticipated rates of return  compensation increases and current expected mortality rates 
we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is appropriate to do so 
the effects of modifications are recognized immediately on our consolidated balance sheet  but are generally amortized into our consolidated statement of operations over future periods  with the deferred amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under our plans are reasonable based on our experience  market conditions and input from our actuaries and investment advisers 
we determine our assumption for the discount rate to be used for purposes of computing annual service and interest costs based on the citigroup pension liability index as of our respective year end dates 
the weighted average discount rate for pension and other postretirement benefits rounded to the nearest quarter of one percent was and for the years ended and  respectively 
a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate at year end would increase the pension and other postretirement plans projected benefit obligation by approximately million 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rate at the year ended would decrease the pension and other postretirement plans projected benefit obligation by approximately million 
our investment objective is to maximize the long term return on the pension plan assets within prudent levels of risk 
investments are primarily diversified with a blend of equity securities  fixed income securities and alternative investments 
equity investments are diversified by including united states and non united states stocks  growth stocks  value stocks and stocks of large and small companies 
fixed income securities are primarily united states governmental and corporate bonds  including mutual funds 
alternative investments are primarily private equity hedge funds and hedge fund of funds 
we consult with our financial advisers on a regular basis regarding our investment objectives and asset performance 
new accounting pronouncements we are required to adopt certain new accounting pronouncements 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
commitments and contingencies our business and operations are subject to a number of significant risks  the most of which are summarized in item a risk factors and in note to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks such as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
as of december   we had variable rate debt outstanding of million 
our term loan b is subject to a libor floor of 
as such  a change of to current libor rates would have a minimal impact to our interest expense 
our changes in foreign currency exchange rates are managed through normal operating and financing activities 
we have foreign operations  primarily in canada and india  and thus are exposed to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
for the year ended  a uniform strengthening of the united states dollar relative to the local currency of our foreign operations would have resulted in a decrease in sales and operating income of approximately million  and million  respectively
