freeweigh 
net and formweigh 
net provide full network capability and enable customers to collect and archive data in compliance with cfr part product inspection increasing safety and consumer protection requirements are driving the need for more sophisticated end of line product inspection systems eg  for use in food processing and packaging  pharmaceutical and other industries 
we are a leading global provider of metal detectors  x ray and camera based visioning equipment and checkweighers that are used in these industries 
metal detectors are most commonly used to detect fine particles of metal that may be contained in raw materials or may be generated by the manufacturing process itself 
x ray based vision inspection helps detect non metallic contamination  such as glass  stones and pits  which enter the manufacturing process for similar reasons 
our x ray systems can also detect metal in metallized containers and can be used for mass control 
we 
table of contents also provide camera based vision inspection solutions that provide in line inspection of package quality and content and enable our customers to implement traceability and serialization tracking  which are needs for food and beverage  consumer goods and pharmaceutical companies 
checkweighers are used to control the filling content of packaged goods such as food  pharmaceuticals and cosmetics 
both x ray and metal detection systems may be used together with checkweighers as components of integrated packaging lines 
freeweigh

we offer stand alone scales for basic counter weighing and pricing  price finding and printing 
in addition  we offer networked scales and software  which can integrate backroom  counter  self service and checkout functions and can incorporate fresh goods item data into a supermarket s overall food item and inventory management system 
customer benefits are in the areas of pricing  merchandising  inventory management and regulatory compliance 
our instruments have been expanded to allow in store marketing which permits customers to make more decisions at the point of sale 
the retail business accounted for approximately of our net sales in  in and in customers and distribution our principal customers include companies in the following key end markets the life science industry pharmaceutical and biotech companies  as well as independent research organizations  food and beverage producers  food retailers  chemical  specialty chemicals and cosmetics companies  the transportation and logistics industry  the metals industry  the electronics industry  and the academic community 
our products are sold through a variety of distribution channels 
generally  more technically sophisticated products are sold through our direct sales force  while less complicated products are sold through indirect channels 
our sales through direct channels exceed our sales through indirect channels 
a significant portion of our sales in the americas is generated through indirect channels  including sales of our ohaus branded products 
ohaus branded products target markets  such as the educational market  in which customers are interested in lower cost  a more limited set of features and less comprehensive support and service 
we have a diversified customer base  with no single customer accounting for more than of net sales 
sales and service market organizations we maintain geographically focused market organizations around the world that are responsible for all aspects of our sales and service 
the market organizations are customer focused  with an emphasis on building and maintaining value added relationships with customers in our target market segments 
each market organization has the ability to leverage best practices from other units while maintaining the flexibility to adapt its marketing and service efforts to account for different cultural and economic conditions 
market organizations also work closely with our producing organizations described below by providing feedback on manufacturing and product development initiatives  new product and application ideas and information about key market segments 

table of contents we have one of the largest and broadest global sales and service organizations among precision instrument manufacturers 
at december   our sales and service group consisted of approximately  employees in sales  marketing and customer service including related administration and post sales technical service  located in countries 
this field organization has the capability to provide service and support to our customers and distributors in major markets across the globe 
this is important because our customers increasingly seek to do business with a consistent global approach 
service our service business remains successful with a focus on repair and preventative maintenance services as well as further expansion of our offerings to include value added services for a range of market needs  including regulatory compliance qualification  calibration and certification 
we have a unique offering to our pharmaceutical customers in promoting use of our instruments in compliance with fda regulations  and we can provide these services regardless of the customer s location around the world 
this global service network is also an important factor in our ability to expand in emerging markets 
we estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world 
service representing service contracts  repairs and replacement parts accounted for approximately of our net sales in and  and in a significant portion of this amount is derived from the sale of replacement parts 
beyond revenue opportunities  we believe service is a key part of our solution offering and helps significantly in customer retention 
the close relationships and frequent contact with our large customer base provide us with sales opportunities and innovative product and application ideas 
research and development and manufacturing producing organizations our research  product development and manufacturing efforts are organized into a number of producing organizations 
our focused producing organizations help reduce product development time and costs  improve customer focus and maintain technological leadership 
the producing organizations work together to share ideas and best practices  and there is a close interface and coordinated customer interaction among marketing organizations and producing organizations 
research and development we continue to invest in product innovation to provide technologically advanced products to our customers for existing and new applications 
over the last three years  we have invested million in research and development million in  million in and million in 
in  we spent approximately of net sales on research and development 
our research and development efforts fall into two categories technology advancements  which generate new products and increase the value of our products 
these advancements may be in the form of enhanced or new functionality  new applications for our technologies  more accurate or reliable measurement  additional software capability or automation through robotics or other means  which allow us to design products more specific to the needs of the industries we serve  and cost reductions  which reduce the manufacturing cost of our products through better overall design 
we devote a substantial proportion of our research and development budget to software development 
this includes software to process the signals captured by the sensors of our instruments  application specific software and software that connects our solutions into customers existing it systems 
we closely 
table of contents integrate research and development with marketing  manufacturing and product engineering 
we have approximately  employees in research and development and product engineering in countries around the globe 
manufacturing we are a worldwide manufacturer  with facilities principally located in china  germany  switzerland  the united kingdom and the united states 
laboratory instruments are produced mainly in switzerland and to a lesser extent in the united states and china  while our remaining products are manufactured worldwide 
we emphasize product quality in our manufacturing operations  and most of our products require very strict tolerances and exact specifications 
we use an extensive quality control system that is integrated into each step of the manufacturing process 
all major manufacturing facilities have achieved iso certification 
we believe that our manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our present and currently anticipated demand 
we generally manufacture only critical components  which are components that contain proprietary technology 
when outside manufacturing is more efficient  we contract with other manufacturers for certain nonproprietary components 
we use a wide range of suppliers 
we believe our supply arrangements are adequate and that there are no material constraints on the sources and availability of materials 
from time to time we may rely on a single supplier for all of our requirements of a particular component 
supply arrangements for electronic components are generally made globally 
backlog  seasonality our manufacturing turnaround time is generally short  which permits us to manufacture orders to fill for most of our products 
backlog is generally a function of requested customer delivery dates and is typically no longer than one to two months 
our business has historically experienced a slight amount of seasonal variation  particularly the high end laboratory instruments business 
traditionally  sales in the first quarter are slightly lower than  and sales in the fourth quarter are slightly higher than  sales in the second and third quarters 
fourth quarter sales have historically generated approximately to of our net sales 
this trend has a somewhat greater effect on income from operations than on net sales because fixed costs are spread evenly across all quarters 
employees our total workforce including employees and temporary personnel as of december  was approximately  throughout the world  including approximately  in europe   in north and south america and  in asia and other countries 
we believe our employee relations are good  and we have not suffered any material employee work stoppage or strike during the last five years 
labor unions do not represent a meaningful number of our employees 
sustainability we believe a sustainable business is one positioned for long term growth and for us it defines our approach to decision making  from how we manage our impact on the environment to our relationships with employees  customers and shareholders 
we produced our first sustainability report in which outlined our greenmt program which was launched in to improve our understanding of how our business affects the environment 
we have gathered data to understand the magnitude of the global greenhouse gas or co footprint generated not only by our fuel and electricity use  but also the products we sell and our use of supply chains 
we are now working to establish goals and will start to make reductions in these emissions 
this includes new ways of managing our vehicle fleets  incorporating new 
table of contents design features into our products  improving the energy efficiency of our buildings and processes and looking at how we source the electricity we use in our facilities 
we think these efforts will produce a favorable impact on the environment as well as potential savings in future periods 
blue ocean program blue ocean refers to our program to establish a new global operating model with standardized  automated and integrated processes  and high levels of global data transparency 
it will encompass a new enterprise architecture  with a global  single instance erp system 
within our it systems we are moving toward integrated  homogeneous applications and common data structures 
we will also largely standardize our key business processes 
the implementation of the systems and processes have been proceeding on a staggered basis over a multi year period with the initial go live rollout having occurred in we have implemented the blue ocean program in our swiss and chinese operations and now have approximately one third of the program completed as measured in users 
we expect to implement the program in the united states and germany over the next two years and will then have more than half of the company users on the system 
incremental capital expenditures for the blue ocean program are more than million annually 
this amount may change based upon fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
we expect the return on this investment when complete to include improved realized pricing  reduced operating costs and working capital requirements 
intellectual property we hold over  patents and trademarks including pending applications  primarily in the united states  switzerland  germany  the united kingdom  italy  france  japan  china  south korea  brazil and india 
our products generally incorporate a wide variety of technological innovations  some of which are protected by patents of various durations 
products are generally not protected as a whole by individual patents  and as a result  no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business 
we have numerous trademarks  including the mettler toledo name and logo  which are material to our business 
we regularly protect against infringement of our intellectual property 
regulation our products are subject to various regulatory standards and approvals by weights and measures regulatory authorities 
all of our electrical components are subject to electrical safety standards 
we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations 
approvals are required to ensure our instruments do not impermissibly influence other instruments and are themselves not affected by other instruments 
in addition  some of our products are used in legal for trade applications  in which prices based on weight are calculated and for which specific weights and measures approvals are required 
although there are a large number of regulatory agencies across our markets  there is an increasing trend toward harmonization of standards  and weights and measures regulation is harmonized across the european union 
our products may also be subject to special requirements depending on the end user and market 
for example  laboratory customers are typically subject to good laboratory practices glp  industrial customers to good manufacturing practices gmp  pharmaceutical customers to us food and drug administration fda regulations  and customers in food processing industries may be subject to hazard analysis and critical control point haccp regulations 
products used in hazardous environments may also be subject to special requirements 
environmental matters we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world 
like many of our 
table of contents competitors  we have incurred  and will continue to incur  capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 
we are currently involved in  or have potential liability with respect to  the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities 
a former subsidiary of mettler toledo  llc mt known as hi speed checkweigher co  inc hi speed was one of two private parties ordered by the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep  in an administrative consent order aco signed on june   to investigate and remediate certain ground water contamination at a certain property in landing  new jersey 
after the other party ordered under this aco failed to fulfill its obligations  hi speed became solely responsible for compliance with the aco 
residual ground water contamination at this site is now within a classification exception area cea which njdep has approved and within which mt oversees monitoring of the decay of contaminants of concern 
a concurrent well restriction area also exists for the site 
the njdep does not view these vehicles as remedial measures  but rather as institutional controls that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated 
in  testing of indoor air at certain buildings within the site led to the installation of a vapor intrusion mitigation system at one building 
we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with the site over the next several years will approximate million 
in addition  certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and  over such time  some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous 
it is possible that these sites  as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes  may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation 
although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and  to date  we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters  it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
competition our markets are highly competitive 
many of the markets in which we compete are fragmented both geographically and by application  particularly the industrial and food retailing markets 
as a result  we face numerous regional or specialized competitors  many of which are well established in their markets 
for example  some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own 
in addition  some of our competitors are domiciled in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours 
we are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets who  although relatively small in size today  could become larger companies in their home markets 
given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets  and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets  emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors 
taken together  the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets 
we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices 
although we believe that we have technological and other competitive advantages over many of our competitors  we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages 
these advantages include our worldwide market leadership positions  our global brand and reputation  our track record of technological innovation  our comprehensive  high quality solution offering  our global sales and service offering  our large installed base of weighing instruments  and the diversification of our revenue base by geographic region  product range and customer 
to remain competitive  we must continue to invest in research and development  sales and marketing and customer service and support 
we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these 
table of contents investments or that we will be successful in identifying  developing and maintaining any competitive advantages 
we believe the principal competitive factors in developed markets for purchasing decisions are the product itself  application support  service support and price 
in emerging markets  where there is greater demand for less sophisticated products  price is a more important factor than in developed markets 
competition in the us laboratory market is also influenced by the presence of large distributors that sell not only our products but those of our competitors as well

table of contents item a 
risk factors factors affecting our future operating results the majority of our business is derived from companies in developed countries 
continued economic uncertainty in these countries may adversely affect our operating results 
although the percentage of our sales coming from emerging markets is growing  the majority of our business is still derived from companies in developed countries 
economic instability in many parts of the world  including the potential for a sovereign debt crisis in the european union and the united states  continues to be a situation that we are monitoring closely 
concerns regarding this potential financial crisis on financial institutions globally would likely have an adverse effect on the global capital markets 
more specifically  an escalation of the european or us debt crises could have the following adverse effects a substantial drop in demand for our products because of the basic inability of companies to complete commercial transactions severe limits on the ability of our company  our customers  suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses unavailability of liquidity at acceptable financing costs  if at all the inability to obtain materials and supplies potential devaluation and or impairment of assets increased accounts receivable write offs difficulty in collecting accounts receivables potential disputes about the currency of payment under various contractual arrangements for the purchases and sales of goods and services increased foreign exchange rate volatility that could result in unexpected changes in profitability and cash flow because our customers often decrease or delay capital expenditures in uncertain or difficult economic times  economic downturns or recessions in developed countries adversely affect our operating results 
customers may also purchase lower cost products made by competitors and not resume purchasing our products even after economic conditions improve 
these conditions would reduce our revenues and profitability 
concerns regarding the european debt crisis and market perception concerning the instability of the euro could affect our operating profits 
we conduct business in many countries that use the euro as their currency the eurozone 
concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations  the overall stability of the euro  and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual eurozone countries 
these concerns could lead to the re introduction of individual currencies in one or more eurozone countries  or in more extreme circumstances  the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely 
should the euro dissolve entirely  the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time 
these potential developments  or market perceptions concerning these and related issues  could adversely affect the value of our euro denominated assets and obligations 
in addition  concerns over the effect of this financial crisis on financial institutions 
table of contents in europe and globally could have an adverse effect on the global capital markets  and more specifically on the ability of our company  our customers  suppliers and lenders to finance their respective businesses  to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs  if at all  on the availability of supplies and materials and on the demand for our products 
we are subject to certain risks associated with our international operations and fluctuating conditions in emerging markets  and have a significant concentration of business in china 
we conduct business in many countries  including emerging markets in asia  latin america and eastern europe  and these operations represent a significant portion of our sales and earnings 
for example  our chinese operations account for million of sales to external customers  approximately of our global production  and million of segment profit during in addition to the currency risks discussed below  international operations pose other substantial risks and problems for us 
for instance  various local jurisdictions in which we operate may revise or alter their respective legal and regulatory requirements 
in addition  we may encounter one or more of the following obstacles or risks tariffs and trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing local operations and or mandatory salary increases for local employees  credit risks arising from financial difficulties facing local customers and distributors  difficulties in protecting intellectual property  nationalization of private enterprises which may result in the confiscation of assets as we hold significant assets around the world in the form of property  plant and equipment  inventory and accounts receivable  as well as million of cash at december  in our chinese subsidiaries  restrictions on investments and or limitations regarding foreign ownership  adverse tax consequences  including tax disputes  imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries  and other uncertain local economic  political and social conditions  including hyper inflationary conditions or periods of low or no productivity growth 
we must also comply with a variety of regulations regarding the conversion and repatriation of funds earned in local currencies 
for example  converting earnings from our operations in china into other currencies and repatriating these funds require governmental approvals 
if we cannot comply with these or other applicable regulations  we may face increased difficulties in utilizing cash flow generated by these operations outside of china 
while we continued to experience sales growth in emerging markets during  growth in china was lower than recent years 
fluctuating economic conditions and the current change in china political leadership may continue to affect our results of operations in these markets in the future 
certain emerging markets have also experienced currency devaluations and inflationary prices 
economic problems in individual markets can also spread to other economies  adding to the adverse conditions we may face in emerging markets 
we remain committed to emerging markets  particularly those in asia  latin america and eastern europe 
however  fluctuating economic conditions may adversely affect our results of operations in these markets 

table of contents we operate in highly competitive markets  and it may be difficult to preserve operating margins  gain market share and maintain a technological advantage 
our markets are highly competitive 
many of the markets in which we compete are fragmented both geographically and by application  particularly the industrial and food retailing markets 
as a result  we face numerous regional or specialized competitors  many of which are well established in their markets 
in addition  some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own 
some of our competitors are domiciled or operate in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours 
we are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets who  although relatively small in size today  could become larger companies in their home markets 
given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets  and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets  emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors 
taken together  the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets 
we expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices 
although we believe that we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors  we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages 
we are vulnerable to system failures  including those that may be related to cyber security attacks  which could harm our business 
we rely on our technology infrastructure  among other functions  to interact with suppliers  sell our products and services  support our customers  fulfill orders and bill  collect and make payments 
our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters  power loss  telecommunication failures  terrorist attacks  computer viruses  computer denial of service attacks and other events 
when we upgrade or change systems  we may suffer interruptions in service  loss of data or reduced functionality 
a significant number of our systems are not redundant  and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality 
despite any precautions we may take  such problems could result in  among other consequences  interruptions in our services or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information  which could harm our reputation and financial condition 
we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our services as a result of system failures 
we also are in the process of implementing our blue ocean program  a program to globalize our business processes and information technology systems that includes the implementation of a company wide enterprise resource planning system 
the implementation of this program has been proceeding on a staggered basis over a multi year period with the initial go live rollout having occurred in we have implemented the blue ocean program in our swiss and chinese operations and now have approximately one third of the program completed as measured in users 
we expect to implement the program in the united states and germany over the next two years and will then have more than half of the company users on the system 
if the implementation of any unit is flawed  we could suffer interruptions in operations and customer facing activities which could harm our reputation and financial condition  or cause us to lose data  experience reduced functionality or have delays in reporting financial information 
it may take us longer to implement the blue ocean program than we have planned  and the project may cost us more than we have estimated  either of which would negatively impact our ability to generate cost savings or other efficiencies 
in addition  the implementation of blue ocean will increase our reliance on a single information technology system which would have greater consequences should we experience a system disruption 

table of contents our ability to deliver products and services may be disrupted 
an interruption in our business due to events such as disruptions with our supply chain  natural disasters  pandemics or other health crises  fires or explosions may cause us to temporarily be unable to deliver products or services to our customers 
it may be expensive to resolve these issues  even though some of these risks are covered by insurance policies 
more importantly  customers may switch to competitors and may not return to us even if we resolve the interruption 
our product development efforts may not produce commercially viable products in a timely manner 
we must introduce new products and enhancements in a timely manner  or our products could become technologically obsolete over time  which would harm our operating results 
to remain competitive  we must continue to make significant investments in research and development  sales and marketing and customer service and support 
we cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments 
in developing new products  we may be required to make substantial investments before we can determine their commercial viability 
as a result  we may not be successful in developing new products and we may never realize the benefits of our research and development activities 
a widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue could negatively affect our business  making it more difficult and expensive to meet our obligations to our customers  and could result in reduced demand from our customers 
in recent years  a number of countries have experienced outbreaks of the hn influenza swine flu or  in the asia pacific region  outbreaks of sars and or avian influenza bird flu 
despite the implementation of certain precautions  we are susceptible to such outbreaks 
as a result of such outbreaks  businesses can be shut down and individuals can become ill or quarantined 
outbreaks of infectious diseases such as these  particularly in north america  europe  china or other locations significant to our operations  could adversely affect general commercial activity  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  business or prospects 
if our operations are curtailed because of health issues  we may need to seek alternate sources of supply for services and staff and these alternate sources may be more expensive 
alternate sources may not be available or may result in delays in shipments to our customers  each of which would affect our results of operations 
in addition  a curtailment of our product design operations could result in delays in the development of new products 
further  if our customers businesses are affected by health issues  they might delay or reduce purchases from us  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
a prolonged downturn or additional consolidation in the pharmaceutical  food  food retailing and chemical industries could adversely affect our operating results 
our products are used extensively in the pharmaceutical  food and beverage and chemical industries 
consolidation in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries hurt our sales in prior years 
a prolonged economic downturn or additional consolidation in any of these industries could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  the capital spending policies of our customers in these industries are based on a variety of factors we cannot control  including the resources available for purchasing equipment  the spending priorities among various types of equipment and policies regarding capital expenditures 
any decrease or delay in capital spending by our customers would cause our revenues to decline and could harm our profitability 

table of contents we may face risks associated with future acquisitions 
we may pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines  technologies or businesses 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired operations  technologies and products  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  and potential departures of key employees of the acquired company 
if we successfully identify acquisitions in the future  completing such acquisitions may result in new issuances of our stock that may be dilutive to current owners  increases in our debt and contingent liabilities and additional amortization expense related to intangible assets 
any of these acquisition related risks could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
larger companies have identified life sciences and instruments as businesses they will consider entering  which could change the competitive dynamics of these markets 
in addition  we may not be able to identify  successfully complete or integrate potential acquisitions in the future 
however  even if we can do so  we cannot be sure that these acquisitions will have a positive impact on our business or operating results 
if we cannot protect our intellectual property rights  or if we infringe or misappropriate the proprietary rights of others  our operating results could be harmed 
our success depends on our ability to obtain and enforce patents on our technology  maintain our trademarks and protect our trade secrets 
our patents may not provide complete protection  and competitors may develop similar products that are not covered by our patents 
our patents may also be challenged by third parties and invalidated or narrowed 
competitors sometimes seek to take advantage of our trademarks or brands in ways that may create customer confusion or weaken our brand 
although we take measures to protect confidential information  improper use or disclosure of our trade secrets may still occur 
we may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others 
the cost of any litigation could affect our profitability regardless of the outcome  and management attention could be diverted 
if we are unsuccessful in such litigation  we may have to pay damages  stop the infringing activity and or obtain a license 
if we fail to obtain a required license  we may be unable to sell some of our products  which could result in a decline in our revenues 
departures of key employees could impair our operations 
we generally have employment contracts with each of our key employees 
our executive officers own shares of our common stock and or have options to purchase additional shares 
nevertheless  such individuals could leave the company 
if any key employees stopped working for us  our operations could be harmed 
important r d personnel may leave and join competitors  which could substantially delay or hinder ongoing development projects 
we have no key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our senior executives 
we may be adversely affected by environmental laws and regulations 
we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations  including those relating to air emissions  wastewater discharges  the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances 
we incur expenditures in complying with environmental laws and regulations 
we are currently involved in  or have potential liability with respect to  the remediation of past contamination in various facilities 
in addition  some of our facilities are or have been in operation for many decades and may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are hazardous or may be considered hazardous 
table of contents in the future 
these sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent waste may in the future be identified as contaminated and require remediation 
accordingly  it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that may harm our results of operations or financial condition 
we may be adversely affected by new regulations relating to conflict minerals 
in august  the sec adopted new disclosures and reporting requirements for companies whose products contain certain minerals and their derivatives  namely tin  tantalum  tungsten or gold  known as conflict minerals 
companies must report annually whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo drc and adjoining countries and in some cases to perform extensive due diligence on their supply chains for such minerals 
the implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing  availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacturing of our products 
in addition  we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements  including cost related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products 
since our supply chain is complex  the due diligence procedures that we implement may not enable us to ascertain with sufficient certainty the origins for these minerals or determine that these minerals are drc conflict free  which may harm our reputation 
we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that our products be certified as drc conflict free  which could harm our relationships with these customers and or lead to a loss of revenue 
these new requirements also could have the effect of limiting the pool of suppliers from which we source these minerals  and we may be unable to obtain conflict free minerals at prices similar to the past  which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability 
we may be adversely affected by failure to comply with regulations of governmental agencies or by the adoption of new regulations 
our products are subject to regulation by governmental agencies 
these regulations govern a wide variety of activities relating to our products  from design and development  to product safety  labeling  manufacturing  promotion  sales and distribution 
if we fail to comply with these regulations  or if new regulations are adopted that substantially change existing practice or impose new burdens  we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution 
in addition  we could be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 
we may experience impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets 
as of december   our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of million and other intangible assets of million 
our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with us gaap  our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired 
the evaluation is based on valuation models that estimate fair value based on expected future cash flows and profitability projections 
in preparing the valuation models we consider a number of factors  including operating results  business plans  economic conditions  future cash flows  and transactions and market data 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses 
the significant estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include sales growth  controllable cost growth  perpetual 
table of contents growth  effective tax rates and discount rates 
our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 
should any of these estimates or assumptions change  or should we incur lower than expected operating performance or cash flows  including from a prolonged economic slowdown  we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units  possibly prior to the required annual assessment 
these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 
our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 
unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could impact our profitability 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various other foreign jurisdictions  and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to allocation of expenses among different jurisdictions 
our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings by jurisdiction  changes in tax laws or tax rates  changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and material adjustments from tax audits 
in particular  the carrying value of deferred tax assets  which are predominantly in the us  is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in the us in addition  the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions  and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability 
our tax expense could increase as a result of a changing application of tax law 
as a result of the current uncertain financial and economic environment  governments in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate are facing greater pressure on public finances  which could lead to an increased tendency for a more aggressive application of existing tax laws and regulations 
governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate from time to time also implement changes to tax laws and regulations 
any changes in corporate income tax rates or regulations  on repatriation of dividends or capital  on transfer pricing as well as changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our cash flow and lead to increases in our overall tax burden  which would negatively affect our profitability 
currency fluctuations affect our operating profits 
because we conduct operations in many countries  our operating income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
swiss franc denominated expenses represent a much greater percentage of our total operating expenses than swiss franc denominated sales represent of our total net sales 
in part  this is because most of our manufacturing and product development costs in switzerland relate to products that are sold outside switzerland 
in addition  we have a number of corporate functions located in switzerland 
therefore  if the swiss franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading currencies eg  the eg dollar  the euro  other major european currencies  the chinese yuan and the japanese yen  our operating profit is reduced 
we also have significantly more sales in euro than we have expenses 
therefore  when the euro weakens against the us dollar and the swiss franc  it also decreases our operating profits 
accordingly  the swiss franc exchange rate to the euro is an important cross rate that we monitor 
during the third quarter of  the swiss national bank established a floor of relating to the swiss franc exchange rate to the euro 
the duration for which the swiss national bank will 
table of contents maintain this exchange rate floor of is currently unknown 
beginning in the third quarter of  we entered into foreign currency forward contracts  as described in note of our consolidated financial statements  which reduce our exposure to a strengthening of the swiss franc versus the euro 
these forward contracts currently continue until january we estimate  absent these forward contracts  that a strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of approximately million to million on an annual basis 
the previously described foreign currency forward contracts reduce this exposure by approximately 
we also estimate a strengthening of the swiss franc against the us dollar would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of million to million on an annual basis 
in addition to the swiss franc and major european currencies  we also conduct business in many geographies throughout the world  including asia pacific  the united kingdom  eastern europe  latin america and canada 
fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the us dollar can also affect our operating results 
in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits  our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates  particularly between the us dollar and the swiss franc 
based on our outstanding debt at december   we estimate that a weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately million in the reported us dollar value of the debt 
we have debt and we may incur substantially more debt  which could affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and may otherwise restrict our activities 
we have debt and we may incur substantial additional debt in the future 
as of december   we had total indebtedness of approximately million  net of cash of million 
we are also permitted by the terms of our debt instruments to incur substantial additional indebtedness  subject to the restrictions therein 
the existence and magnitude of our debt could have important consequences 
for example  it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our debt instruments  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness  which would reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital  capital expenditures  product development and other corporate requirements  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  including changes in raw material costs  limit our ability to respond to business opportunities  limit our ability to borrow additional funds  which may be necessary  and subject us to financial and other restrictive covenants  which  if we fail to comply with these covenants and our failure is not waived or cured  could result in an event of default under our debt instruments 
the agreements governing our debt impose restrictions on our business 
the note purchase agreements governing our senior notes and the agreements governing our credit facility contain covenants imposing various restrictions on our business 
these restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise 
the restrictions these covenants place on us include limitations on our ability to incur liens and consolidate  merge  sell or lease all or substantially all of our assets 
our credit facility and the note purchase agreements governing our senior notes also require us to meet certain financial ratios 
our ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by events beyond our control  including prevailing economic  financial and industry conditions  and is subject to the risks in this section 
the breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the note purchase agreements governing the senior notes and or under our credit facility 
an event of default under the agreements governing our debt would permit holders of our debt to declare all amounts owed to them 
table of contents under such agreements to be immediately due and payable 
acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on the senior notes and repay the principal amount of the senior notes 
the lenders under our credit agreement may be unable to meet their funding commitments  reducing the amount of our borrowing capacity 
we have a revolving credit facility outstanding under which the company and certain of its subsidiaries may borrow up to million 
our credit facility is provided by a group of financial institutions  who individually have between and of the total funding commitment 
at december   we had borrowings of million outstanding under our credit facility 
our ability to borrow further funds under our credit facility is subject to the various lenders financial condition and ability to make funds available 
even though the financial institutions are contractually obligated to lend funds  if one or more of the lenders encounters financial difficulties or goes bankrupt  such lenders may be unable to meet their obligations 
this could result in us being unable to borrow the full million 
we make from time to time forward looking statements  and actual events or results may differ materially from these statements because assumptions we have made prove incorrect due to market conditions in our industries or other factors 
we from time to time provide forward looking statements both in our filings with the sec and orally in connection with our quarterly earnings calls  including guidance on anticipated earnings per share 
these statements are only predictions 
actual events or results may differ materially from these statements because assumptions we have made prove incorrect due to market conditions in our industries or other factors 
we refer you to the factors discussed under the captions factors affecting our future operating results in the business section and the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section of this annual report on form k  which describe risks and factors that could cause results to differ materially from those projected in those forward looking statements 
we operate in a continually changing business environment  and new risk factors emerge from time to time 
management cannot predict these new risk factors  nor can it assess the impact  if any  of these new risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements 
accordingly  forward looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results 
in providing guidance on our future earnings  our management evaluates our budgets  our strategic plan and certain factors relating to our business 
this evaluation requires management to make several key assumptions relating to both external and internal factors 
some of the key external assumptions include the outlook for our end markets and the global economy  impact of external factors on our competition  financial position of our customers  the estimated costs of purchasing materials  developments in personnel costs  and rates for currency exchange  particularly between the swiss franc and the euro 
some of these assumptions may prove to be incorrect over time 
for example  although no one customer accounts for more than of our revenues  if a number of our customers experienced significant deteriorations in their financial positions concurrently  it could have an impact on our results of operations 

table of contents some of our key internal assumptions include the following our ability to implement our business strategy  the effectiveness of our marketing programs such as our spinnaker initiatives  our ability to develop and deliver innovative products and services  the continued growth of our sales in emerging markets  our ability to implement price increases as forecasted  and the effectiveness of our cost saving initiatives 
these internal assumptions may also prove to be incorrect over time 
for example  with respect to our ability to realize our planned price increases without disturbing our customer base in core markets  in certain markets  such as emerging markets  price tends to be a more significant factor in customers decisions to purchase our products 
furthermore  we can have no assurance that our cost reduction programs will generate adequate cost savings 
additionally  it may become necessary to take additional restructuring actions resulting in additional restructuring costs 
we believe our current assumptions are reasonable and prudent for planning purposes 
however  should any of these assumptions prove to be incorrect  or should we incur lower than expected operating performance or cash flows  we may experience results different than our projections 
our ability to generate cash depends in part on factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to an extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors  including those described in this section  that are beyond our control 
we cannot ensure that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity 
we cannot ensure that we will be able to refinance any of our debt  including our credit facility and the senior notes  on commercially reasonable terms or at all

local currency changes exclude the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations 
local currency amounts are determined by translating current and previous year consolidated financial information at an index utilizing historical currency exchange rates 
we believe local currency information provides a helpful assessment of business performance and a useful measure of results between periods 
we do not  nor do we suggest that investors should  consider such non gaap financial measures in isolation from  or as a substitute for  financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 
we present non gaap financial measures in reporting our financial results to provide investors with an additional analytical tool to evaluate our operating results 
overview we operate a global business  with sales that are diversified by geographic region  product range and customer 
we hold leading positions worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this leadership to several factors  including the strength of our brand name and reputation  our comprehensive offering of innovative instruments and solutions  and the breadth and quality of our global sales and service network 
during the global environment has deteriorated  especially in europe 
net sales in us dollars increased by in and increased by in excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations  or in local currencies  net sales increased in and in we expect our local currency organic sales growth in will continue to be less than growth rates experienced in  and net sales may decline in future quarters depending on economic conditions 
given economic uncertainty  it is difficult to predict the extent to which our results may be adversely affected 
however  we expect to continue to benefit from our strong global leadership positions  diversified customer base  robust product offering  investment in emerging markets and the impact of our global sales and marketing programs 
examples include identifying and investing in growth opportunities  improving our lead generation and lead nurturing processes  further penetrating our market segments and more effectively pricing our products and services 
with respect to our end user markets  we experienced increased results during versus the prior year in our laboratory related end user markets  such as pharmaceutical and biotech customers as well as the laboratories of chemical companies and food and beverage companies 
demand from these markets increased during  particularly in emerging markets 
however  demand from these markets was 
table of contents partially offset by reduced demand from universities and government funded research institutions in developed markets  as well as difficult economic conditions in europe 
we expect net sales growth of our laboratory related products particularly in europe to continue to be less than growth rates experienced in  and net sales may decline in future quarters depending on economic conditions 
it is currently difficult to predict the extent to which our results may be adversely affected 
our industrial markets  especially core industrial products  were adversely impacted in by deterioration in global economic conditions  especially in europe 
our industrial markets were also impacted by lower sales growth in china as compared to recent years 
emerging market economies have historically been an important source of growth based upon the expansion of their domestic economies  as well as increased exports as companies have moved production to low cost countries 
we expect net sales growth of our industrial related products particularly in europe and china to continue to be less than growth rates experienced in  and net sales may decline in future quarters depending on economic conditions 
it is currently difficult to predict the extent to which our results may be adversely affected 
our industrial products are especially sensitive to changes in economic growth 
our food retailing markets experienced a decline during  related to decreases in europe and asia rest of world 
the net sales declines were primarily related to reduced project activity as well as unfavorable economic conditions 
traditionally the spending levels in this sector have experienced more volatility than our other customer sectors due to the timing of customer project activity or new regulation 
similar to our industrial business  emerging markets have also historically provided growth as the expansion of local emerging market economies creates a significant number of new retail stores each year 
in  we expect to continue to pursue the overall business growth strategies which we have followed in recent years gaining market share 
our global sales and marketing initiative  spinnaker  continues to be an important growth strategy 
we aim to gain market share by implementing sophisticated sales and marketing programs and leveraging our extensive customer databases 
while this initiative is broad based  efforts to improve these processes include increased segment marketing and leads generation and nurturing activities  the implementation of more effective pricing and value based selling strategies and processes  improved sales force training and effectiveness  cross selling  and other sales and marketing topics 
our comprehensive service offerings also help us further penetrate developed markets 
we estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world 
in addition to traditional repair and maintenance  our service offerings continue to expand into value added services for a range of market needs  including regulatory compliance 
expanding emerging markets 
emerging markets  comprising asia excluding japan  eastern europe  latin america  the middle east and africa  account for approximately of our total net sales 
we have a two pronged strategy in emerging markets first  to capitalize on growth opportunities in these markets and second  to leverage our low cost manufacturing operations in china 
we have over a year track record in china  and our sales in asia have grown more than on a compound annual growth basis in local currency since we have broadened our product offering to the asian markets and are benefiting as multinational customers shift production to china 
we are pleased with our accomplishments in china and in recent years have expanded our territory coverage into second tier cities with new branch offices  additional dealers and more service professionals 
india has also been a source of emerging market sales growth in past years due to increased life science research activities 
local currency sales increased in emerging markets by during versus the prior year 
sales increases were experienced throughout most markets  however growth in china was less than recent years 
we anticipate sales in will continue to increase as compared to  absent a further deterioration in global economic conditions 
however  we expect local currency sales growth will be less than growth rates experienced in 
table of contents to reduce costs  we also continue to shift more of our manufacturing to china where our four facilities manufacture for the local markets as well as for export 
extending our technology lead 
we continue to focus on product innovation 
in the last three years  we spent approximately of net sales on research and development 
we seek to drive shorter product life cycles  as well as improve our product offerings and their capabilities with additional integrated technologies and software 
in addition  we aim to create value for our customers by having an intimate knowledge of their processes via our significant installed product base 
maintaining cost leadership 
we continue to strive to improve our margins by optimizing our cost structure 
for example  we significantly reduced our global cost structure during in response to the global economic slowdown and took further actions during in response to the recent deterioration in the global economy 
we have also focused on reallocating resources and better aligning our cost structure to support higher growth areas and opportunities for margin improvement 
as previously mentioned  shifting production to china has also been an important component of our cost savings initiatives 
we have also implemented global procurement and supply chain management programs over the last several years aimed at lowering supply costs 
our cost leadership initiatives are also focused on continuously improving our invested capital efficiency  such as reducing our working capital levels and ensuring appropriate returns on our expenditures 
pursuing strategic acquisitions 
we seek to pursue acquisitions that may leverage our global sales and service network  respected brand  extensive distribution channels and technological leadership 
we have identified life sciences  product inspection and process analytics as three key areas for acquisitions 
we also continue to pursue bolt on acquisitions 
for example  during we acquired an x ray inspection solutions business in the united states and a vision inspection solutions business in germany  both of which have been integrated into our end of line product inspection systems offering 
during we acquired our pipette distributor in the united kingdom 
results of operations consolidated net sales net sales were  million for the year ended december   compared to  million in and  million in this represents increases in and of and in us dollars and and in local currencies  respectively 
in  our net sales by geographic destination increased in us dollars by in the americas and in asia rest of world and decreased by in europe 
in local currencies  our net sales by geographic destination increased in by in the americas and in asia rest of world  while net sales in europe decreased 
a discussion of sales by operating segment is included below 
acquisitions divestitures  net contributed approximately in america and in europe to net sales growth during net sales in local currencies during december   increased in the americas  in europe and in asia rest of world 
as previously mentioned  the global environment has deteriorated  especially in europe 
we expect our local currency organic sales growth in will continue to be less than growth rates experienced in  and net sales may decline in future quarters depending on economic conditions 
given economic uncertainty  it is difficult to predict the extent to which our results may be adversely affected 
as described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements  our net sales comprise product sales of precision instruments and related services 
service revenues are primarily derived from repair and other services  including regulatory compliance qualification  calibration  certification  preventative maintenance and spare parts 

table of contents net sales of products increased by and in and  respectively in us dollars and by and  respectively in local currencies 
service revenue including spare parts increased in and by and  respectively in u 
s 
dollars  respectively  and in both periods in local currencies 
net sales of our laboratory related products  which represented approximately of our total net sales in  increased by in us dollars and in local currencies during this compares to strong local currency net sales growth of in we experienced modest sales growth in most laboratory related products with solid growth in process analytics and analytical instruments 
sales growth in benefited from favorable price realization as well as volume increases  particularly in asia rest of world 
we expect net sales growth of our laboratory related products particularly in europe to continue to be less than growth rates experienced in  and net sales may decline in future quarters depending on economic conditions 
it is currently difficult to predict the extent to which our results may be adversely affected 
net sales of our industrial related products  which represented approximately of our total net sales in  increased by in us dollars and in local currencies during this compares to strong local currency net sales growth of in acquisitions contributed approximately to our industrial related net sales growth during our industrial related products experienced strong organic sales growth in product inspection products related to increased volume and favorable price realization  offset in part by a decline in our european core industrial business related to decreased sales volume which is related to difficult prior period comparisons and unfavorable economic conditions in europe 
we also experienced reduced industrial related sales growth in asia rest of world in  which is primarily related to reduced growth in china 
we expect net sales of our industrial related products particularly in europe and china to continue to be less than growth rates experienced in  and net sales may decline in future quarters depending on economic conditions 
it is currently difficult to predict the extent to which our results may be adversely affected 
net sales in our food retailing products  which represented approximately of our total net sales in  decreased by in us dollars and in local currencies during we experienced local currency net sales declines in europe and asia rest of world during the net sales declines were primarily related to reduced project activity as well as unfavorable economic conditions 
local currency net sales growth was strong in the americas related to incremental project activity and an easier prior period comparison 
we expect net sales in our food retailing products may continue to decline in future quarters 
it is currently difficult to predict the extent to which our results may be adversely affected 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for  compared to for and for gross profit as a percentage of net sales for products was for  compared to for and for gross profit as a percentage of net sales for services including spare parts was for  compared to for and for the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for was primarily due to improved price realization  reduced material costs  and favorable currency translation fluctuations 
these results were partly offset by unfavorable geographic mix and increased investments in our field service organization 

table of contents research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were for  for and for research and development expenses in us dollars decreased by in and increased in  and in local currencies were flat in and increased in our research and development spending levels reflect changes in part due to the timing of project launch activity 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to for  compared to for and for selling  general and administrative expenses in us dollars decreased by in and increased in  and in local currencies were flat in and increased by in the amount in reflects increased sales and marketing investments especially in emerging markets  offset by lower cash incentives and savings from our cost reduction programs 
restructuring charges during  we initiated additional cost reduction measures in response to global economic conditions 
for the year ending december   we have incurred million of restructuring expenses which primarily comprise severance costs 
see note to our audited consolidated financial statements for a summary of restructuring activity during other charges income  net other charges income  net consisted of net charges of million in  compared to net charges of million and million in and  respectively 
other charges income  net consists primarily of interest income  gains losses from foreign currency transactions and other items 
other charges income  net in also includes a million million after tax charge associated with the sale of our retail software business for in store item and inventory management solutions 
this amount was partially offset by a benefit from unrealized contingent consideration from a previous acquisition totaling million million after tax 
interest expense and taxes interest expense was million for  compared to million for and million for the decrease in interest expense for is primarily resulting from a decrease in average borrowings partially offset by an increase in rates for the period 
the amount reflects additional borrowings in the fourth quarter  in order to facilitate foreign earnings repatriation 
during and we recorded discrete tax items resulting in net tax benefits of million  and million primarily related to the favorable resolution of certain prior year tax matters 
our annual effective tax rate was  and for  and  respectively 
the previously described discrete tax items had the effect of lowering our annual effective tax rate by in both and our consolidated income tax rate is lower than the us statutory rate primarily because of benefits from lower taxed non us operations 
the most significant of these lower taxed operations are in switzerland and china 
results of operations by operating segment the following is a discussion of the financial results of our operating segments 
we currently have five reportable segments us operations  swiss operations  western european operations  chinese operations and other

geographically  we also experienced particularly strong growth in other asia pacific 
segment profit decreased by million in our other segment during  compared to a increase of million during the decrease in segment profit during relates primarily to increased costs from other segments and investments in sales and marketing  partially offset by an increase in sales volume 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments 
in addition  liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing 
currently  our financing requirements are primarily driven by working capital requirements  capital expenditures  share repurchases and acquisitions 
as previously mentioned  global economic conditions deteriorated during our ability to generate cash flows may be reduced by a prolonged global economic slowdown 
cash provided by operating activities totaled million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in resulted principally from increased net earnings and working capital benefits related to decreased inventory levels and the timing of accounts receivable  partially offset by the timing of payables 
the increase in resulted principally from increased net earnings  partially offset by increased incentive payments of approximately million related to previous year performance related compensation incentives  as well as increased working capital associated with the increased sales volume and higher tax payments 
we also made million and million of voluntary incremental pension contributions in and  respectively 
capital expenditures are made primarily for investments in information systems and technology  machinery  equipment and the purchase and expansion of facilities 
our capital expenditures totaled million in  million in and million in our capital expenditures in included approximately million of investments directly related to our blue ocean multi year program of information technology investment compared with million in and million in cash flows used in financing activities during included proceeds of million from the issuance of our senior notes and payments of million of debt issuance costs 
as further described below  in accordance with our share repurchase plan  we repurchased  shares and  shares in the amount of million and million during and  respectively 
cash flows used in financing activities during also included the repayment of our million senior notes which matured on november  the repayment was funded from additional borrowings under our credit facility 
we continue to explore potential acquisitions 
in connection with any acquisition  we may incur additional indebtedness 
in august  we acquired a leader in vision inspection technology for end of line product systems located in germany that has been integrated into our end of line product inspection product offering for an aggregate purchase price of million 
we paid an additional cash consideration of million during related to an earn out period 
we also paid additional contingent cash consideration of million in related to an earn out associated with an acquisition in these additional cash consideration payments are included in cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
during the first quarter  we completed acquisitions totaling million  of which million related to an x ray inspection solutions business that has been integrated into our product inspection product offering 

table of contents we plan to repatriate earnings from china  switzerland  the united kingdom and certain other countries in future years and expect the only additional cost associated with the repatriation of such foreign earnings will be withholding taxes 
all other undistributed earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested 
as of december   we had an immaterial amount of cash and cash equivalents in foreign subsidiaries where undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested 
accordingly  we believe the tax impact associated with repatriating our undistributed foreign earnings will not have a material effect on our liquidity 
senior notes in june  we entered into an agreement to issue and sell in a private placement  six year senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of million and a fixed interest obligation of senior notes under a note purchase agreement among the company and accredited institutional investors the agreement 
the senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company 
the senior notes mature on june  interest is payable semi annually in june and december

we were in compliance with these covenants at december  issuance costs approximating million will be amortized to interest expense over the six year term of the senior notes 
senior notes in october  we entered into an agreement to issue and sell in a private placement  ten year senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of million and a fixed interest obligation of senior notes under a note purchase agreement among the company and accredited institutional investors the agreement

the agreement also requires us to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than to and a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than to the agreement contains customary events of default with customary grace periods  as applicable 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  issuance costs approximating million will be amortized to interest expense over the ten year term of the senior notes 
tender offer repayment of senior notes in november  we issued million of unsecured senior notes due november  senior notes 
on may   we commenced a cash tender offer to purchase any and all of our outstanding senior notes due november  the tender offer  which expired may   resulted in the repurchase of million of the principal balance of the senior notes 
at maturity  on november   we repaid the remaining million outstanding principal balance of our senior notes 
the repayment was funded from additional borrowings under our credit facility 
credit agreement on december   we entered into an million credit agreement the credit agreement  which replaced our million amended and restated credit agreement the prior credit agreement 
the credit agreement is provided by a group of financial institutions and has a maturity date of december  it is a revolving credit facility and is not subject to any scheduled principal payments prior to maturity 
the obligations under the credit agreement are unsecured 
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at current market rates plus a margin based on our senior consolidated leverage ratio  which was  as of december   set at libor plus 
basis points 
we must also pay facility fees that are tied to our leverage ratio 
the credit agreement contains covenants  with which we were in compliance as of december   including maintaining a consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than to and a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than to the credit agreement also places certain limitations on us  including limiting our ability to incur liens or indebtedness at a subsidiary level 
in addition  the credit agreement has several events of default 
we incurred approximately million of debt extinguishment costs during related to the prior credit agreement 
we capitalized million in financing fees during associated with the credit agreement which will be amortized to interest expense through as of december   approximately million was available under the facility 
our short term borrowings and long term debt consisted of the following at december  us dollar other principal trading currencies total million senior notes million senior notes million credit agreement other local arrangements total debt less current portion total long term debt 
table of contents changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we generate cash flow and the currencies in which our borrowings are denominated affect our liquidity 
in addition  because we borrow in a variety of currencies  our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants set forth in our senior notes  senior notes  and credit agreement 
in addition  we do not have any downgrade triggers relating to ratings from rating agencies that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt 
we currently believe that cash flows from operating activities  together with liquidity available under our credit agreement and local working capital facilities  will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs and capital spending requirements for at least the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
we do not have significant outstanding letters of credit or other financial commitments 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years short and long term debt interest on debt non cancelable operating leases pension and post retirement funding purchase obligations total in addition to the above table  we also have liabilities for pension and post retirement funding and income taxes 
however  we cannot determine the timing or the amounts for periods beyond for income taxes and beyond for pension and post retirement funding 
we have purchase commitments for materials  supplies  services and fixed assets in the normal course of business 
due to the proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes  certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions 
we do not expect potential payments under these provisions to materially affect results of operations or financial condition 
this conclusion is based upon reasonably likely outcomes derived by reference to historical experience and current business plans 
share repurchase program we have a billion share repurchase program 
we expect that the new authorization will be utilized over the next several years 
as of december   there were million of remaining common shares authorized to be repurchased under the program 
the share repurchases are expected to be funded from existing cash balances  borrowings and cash generated from operating activities 
repurchases will be made through open market transactions and the amount and timing of purchases will depend on business and market conditions  the stock price  trading restrictions  the level of acquisition activity and other factors 
we have purchased million shares since the inception of the program through december  during the years ended december  and  we spent million and million on the repurchase of  shares and  shares at an average price per share of and  respectively 
we reissued  and  shares held in treasury for the exercise of stock options and restricted stock units during and  respectively 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements currently  we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material 
effect of currency on results of operations currency fluctuations affect our operating profits 
because we conduct operations in many countries  our operating income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
swiss franc denominated expenses represent a much greater percentage of our total operating expenses than swiss franc denominated sales represent of our total net sales 
in part  this is because most of our manufacturing and product development costs in switzerland relate to products that are sold outside switzerland 
in addition  we have a number of corporate functions located in switzerland 
therefore  if the swiss franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading currencies eg  the eg dollar  the euro  other major european currencies  the chinese yuan and the japanese yen  our operating profit is reduced 
we also have significantly more sales in euro than we have expenses 
therefore  when the euro weakens against the us dollar and the swiss franc  it also decreases our operating profits 
accordingly  the swiss franc exchange rate to the euro is an important cross rate that we monitor 
during the third quarter of  the swiss national bank established a floor of relating to the swiss franc exchange rate to the euro 
the duration for which the swiss national bank will maintain this exchange rate floor of is currently unknown 
beginning in the third quarter of  we entered into foreign currency forward contracts  as described in note of our consolidated financial statements  which reduce our exposure to a strengthening of the swiss franc versus the euro 
these forward contracts currently continue until january we estimate  absent these forward contracts  that a strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of approximately million to million on an annual basis 
the previously described foreign currency forward contracts reduce this exposure by approximately 
we also estimate a strengthening of the swiss franc against the us dollar would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of million to million on an annual basis 
in addition to the swiss franc and major european currencies  we also conduct business in many geographies throughout the world  including asia pacific  the united kingdom  eastern europe  latin america and canada 
fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the us dollar can also affect our operating results 
in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits  our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates  particularly between the us dollar and the swiss franc 
based on our outstanding debt at december   we estimate that a weakening of the us dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of approximately million in the reported us dollar value of the debt 
taxes we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the world 
our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors  such as the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions  the tax rates in such jurisdictions  tax treaties between jurisdictions  the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions  earnings repatriations between jurisdictions and changes in law 
generally  the tax liability for each taxpayer within the group is determined either i on a non consolidated non combined basis or ii on a consolidated combined basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction  in either case without regard to the taxable losses of non consolidated non combined affiliated legal entities 

table of contents environmental matters we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world 
like many of our competitors  we have incurred  and will continue to incur  capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations 
we are currently involved in  or have potential liability with respect to  the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities 
a former subsidiary of mettler toledo  llc mt known as hi speed checkweigher co  inc hi speed was one of two private parties ordered by the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep  in an administrative consent order aco signed on june   to investigate and remediate certain ground water contamination at certain property in landing  new jersey 
after the other party ordered under this aco failed to fulfill its obligations  hi speed became solely responsible for compliance with the aco 
residual ground water contamination at this site is now within a classification exception area cea which njdep has approved and within which mt oversees monitoring of the decay of contaminants of concern 
a concurrent well restriction area also exists for the site 
the njdep does not view these vehicles as remedial measures  but rather as institutional controls that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated 
njdep has informally told mt to expect a claim for natural resource damages nrd regarding this site but has not yet made such a claim 
in  testing of indoor air at certain buildings within the site led to the installation of a vapor intrusion mitigation system at one building 
we estimate that the costs of compliance associated with the site over the next several years will approximate million 
in addition  certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and  over such time  some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous 
it is possible that these sites  as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes  may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation 
accordingly  although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and  to date  we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters  it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
inflation inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we use  including raw materials to manufacture our products 
the competitive environment in which we operate limits somewhat our ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices 
moreover  there may be differences in inflation rates between countries in which we incur the major portion of our costs and other countries in which we sell products  which may limit our ability to recover increased costs 
we remain committed to operations in china and eastern europe  which have experienced inflationary conditions 
to date  inflationary conditions have not had a material effect on our operating results 
however  as our presence in china and eastern europe increases  these inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes 
we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge short term intercompany balances with our international businesses on a monthly basis and to hedge certain 
table of contents forecasted intercompany sales 
such contracts limit our exposure to both favorable and unfavorable currency fluctuations 
the net fair value of these contracts was a million net gain at december  a sensitivity analysis to changes on these foreign currency denominated contracts indicates that if the primary currency primarily us dollar  swiss franc and the euro declined by  the fair value of these instruments would decrease by million at december  any resulting changes in fair value would be offset by changes in the underlying hedged balance sheet position 
the sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates 
the assumption that exchange rates change in parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 
we also have other currency risks as described under effect of currency on results of operations 
we have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements 
these contracts are more fully described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of these contracts was a loss of million at december  based on our agreements outstanding at december   a basis point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in the net aggregate market value of these instruments of million 
conversely  a basis point decrease in interest rates would result in a million decrease in the net aggregate market value of these instruments at december  any change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the debt they hedge were prematurely settled 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to pensions and other post retirement benefits  trade accounts receivable  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  revenue and warranty costs 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
employee benefit plans the net periodic pension cost for and projected benefit obligation as of december  was million and million  respectively  for our us pension plan and million and million  respectively  for our international pension plans 
the net periodic post retirement cost for and expected post retirement benefit obligation as of december  for our us post retirement medical benefit plan was million and million  respectively 
pension and post retirement benefit plan expense and obligations are developed from assumptions utilized in actuarial valuations 
the most significant of these assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets 
in accordance with us gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and deferred over future periods 
while management believes the 
table of contents assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our plan obligations and future expense 
the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the long term projected return of those assets  which represent a diversified mix of us and international corporate equities and government and corporate debt securities 
in  we froze our us defined benefit pension plan and discontinued our retiree medical program for certain current and all future employees 
consequently  no significant future service costs will be incurred on these plans 
for  the weighted average return on assets assumption was for the us plan and for the international plans 
a change in the rate of return of would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately million after tax 
the discount rates for defined benefit and post retirement plans are set by benchmarking against high quality corporate bonds 
for  the average discount rate assumption was for the us plan and for the international plans  representing a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist 
a decrease in the discount rate of would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately million after tax 
we made voluntary incremental funding payments of million and million in and  respectively  to increase the funded status of our pension plans 
in the future  we may make additional mandatory or discretionary contributions to our plan or we could be required to make additional cash funding payments 
equity based compensation we also have an equity incentive plan that provides for the grant of stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock units and other equity based awards which are accounted for and recognized in the consolidated statement of operations based on the grant date fair value of the award 
this methodology yields an estimate of fair value based in part on a number of management estimates  the most significant of which include future volatility and estimated option lives 
changes in these assumptions could significantly impact the estimated fair value of stock options 
trade accounts receivable as of december   trade accounts receivable were million  net of a million allowance for doubtful accounts 
trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of probable credit losses in our existing trade accounts receivable 
we determine the allowance based upon a review of both specific accounts for collection and the age of the accounts receivable portfolio 
inventories as of december   inventories were million 
we record our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
cost  which includes direct materials  labor and overhead  is generally determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
the estimated net realizable value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing 
adjustments to the cost basis of our inventory are made for excess and obsolete items based on usage  orders and technological obsolescence 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  reductions in the value of inventory may be required 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets as of december   our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of million and other intangible assets of million 
our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with us gaap  our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired 
the annual evaluation for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are generally based on an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount 
if we are unable to conclude that the goodwill asset is not impaired after considering the totality of events and circumstances during our qualitative assessment  we perform the first step of the two step impairment test by estimating the fair value of the goodwill asset and comparing the fair value to the carrying amount of the goodwill asset 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill asset exceeds its fair value  then we perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
if we are unable to conclude that the indefinite lived intangible asset is not impaired after considering the totality of events and circumstances  we perform an impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
both the qualitative and quantitative evaluations consider operating results  business plans  economic conditions and market data  among other factors 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses 
our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets 
should any of these estimates or assumptions change  or should we incur lower than expected operating performance or cash flows  including from a prolonged economic slowdown  we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units  possibly prior to the required annual assessment 
these types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value 
our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change 
income taxes income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income or equity in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

table of contents we plan to repatriate earnings from china  switzerland  germany  the united kingdom and certain other countries in future years and expect the only additional cost associated with the repatriation of such earnings outside the united states will be withholding taxes 
all other undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested 
the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate for each year in addition to our income mix from geographical regions 
if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change  or should our income mix from our geographical regions change  our effective tax rate could be materially affected 
based on earnings before taxes of million for the year ended december   each increase of million in tax expense would increase our effective tax rate by 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when title to a product has transferred and any significant customer obligations have been fulfilled 
standard shipping terms are generally fob shipping point in most countries and  accordingly  title and risk of loss transfers upon shipment 
in countries where title cannot legally transfer before delivery  the company defers revenue recognition until delivery has occurred 
the company generally maintains the right to accept or reject a product return in its terms and conditions and also maintains appropriate accruals for outstanding credits 
shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in total net sales and the associated expense is recorded in cost of sales for all periods presented 
other than a few small software applications  the company does not sell software products without the related hardware instrument as the software is embedded in the instrument 
the company s products typically require no significant production  modification or customization of the hardware or software that is essential to the functionality of the products 
to the extent the company s solutions have a post shipment obligation  such as customer acceptance  revenue is deferred until the obligation has been completed 
the company defers product revenue where installation is required  unless such installation is deemed perfunctory 
the company also sometimes enters into certain arrangements that require the separate delivery of multiple goods and or services 
these deliverables are accounted for separately if the deliverables have standalone value and the performance of undelivered items is probable and within the company control 
the allocation of revenue between the separate deliverables is typically based on the relative selling price at the time of the sale in accordance with a number of factors including service technician billing rates  time to install and geographic location 
further  certain products are also sold through indirect distribution channels whereby the distributor assumes any further obligations to the customer upon title transfer 
revenue is recognized on these products upon transfer of title and risk of loss to distributors 
distributor discounts are offset against revenue at the time such revenue is recognized 
service revenue not under contract is recognized upon the completion of the service performed 
spare parts sold on a stand alone basis are recognized upon title and risk of loss transfer which is generally at the time of shipment 
revenues from service contracts are recognized ratably over the contract period 
these contracts represent an obligation to perform repair and other services including regulatory compliance qualification  calibration  certification and preventative maintenance on a customer s pre defined equipment over the contract period 
service contracts are separately priced and payment is typically received from the customer at the beginning of the contract period 
warranty we generally offer one year warranties on most of our products 
product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service costs incurred in 
table of contents correcting a product failure 
if we experience claims or significant cost changes in material  freight and vendor charges  our cost of goods sold could be affected
