item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this annual report on form k 
overview dollar amounts in thousands hotel operations 
in  the us hotel industry generally showed improvement in average daily rate  or adr  occupancy and revpar over  but these measures are still below levels prior to the recent recession 
we believe the increases in adr  occupancy and revpar at certain of our hotels in have been below hotel industry averages primarily due to the disruption and displacement caused by renovation and rebranding activities 
during the twelve months ended december   we had of our hotels under renovation for all or part of the period and we rebranded hotels during we expect our high level of hotel renovation activity to continue through and into our hotel tenants and managers 
many of our hotel operating agreements contain security features  such as guarantees and security deposits  which are intended to protect minimum returns and rents due to us in accordance with our operating agreements regardless of hotel performance 
however  the effectiveness of various security features to provide uninterrupted receipt by us of minimum returns and rents is not assured  particularly if the us economy and the lodging industry take an extended period to recover from the severe declines experienced during the recent recession  if economic conditions decline  or if our hotel renovation activities described above do not result in improved operating results at these hotels 
further  certain of the guarantees that have been granted to us are limited in amount and duration and do not provide for payment of the entire amount of the applicable minimum return shortfalls 
if our tenants  managers or guarantors do not earn or pay the minimum returns and rents due to us  our cash flows will decline and we may be unable to pay distributions to our shareholders  repay our debt or fund our debt service obligations

when we reduce the amounts of the security deposits we hold under our operating agreements for payment deficiencies  we record income equal to the amounts by which these deposits are reduced up to the minimum return or minimum rent due to us 
however  reducing the security deposits does not result in additional cash flow to us of the deficiency amounts  but reducing amounts of security deposits may reduce the refunds due to the respective lessees or managers who have provided us with these deposits upon expiration of the respective lease or management agreement 
security deposits are non interest bearing and are not required to be held in escrow 
under all of our hotel contracts that include a security deposit  any amount of the security deposits which is applied to payment deficits may be replenished from future cash flows from the applicable hotel operations pursuant to the terms of the respective contracts 
when we receive payments under guarantees under our leases or operating agreements  we receive cash

all costs of operating and maintaining our properties are paid by our hotel managers as agents for us or by our tenants for their own account 
our hotel managers and tenants derive their funding for property operating expenses  and returns and rents due to us  generally from property operating revenues and  to the extent that these parties themselves fund our minimum returns and minimum rents  from their separate resources 
our hotel managers and tenants include marriott  intercontinental  hyatt  carlson  sonesta  wyndham and morgans 
our travel centers are leased to ta 
we define coverage for each of our hotel management agreements or leases as total property level revenues minus all property level expenses which are not subordinated to the minimum returns and minimum rents due to us divided by the minimum returns or minimum rent payments due to us 
more detail regarding coverage  guarantees and other features of our hotel operating agreements is presented on pages through during the year ended december   eight of our ten hotel operating agreements generated coverage of less than x x to x  our sonesta no 
and marriott no 
agreements generated coverage of x and x during the year ended december   respectively 
we define coverage for our travel center leases as property level revenues minus all property level expenses divided by the minimum rent payments due to us 
during the twelve months ended september   the operating results from our properties in our two travel center leases each generated coverage of x 
because a large percentage of ta business is conducted at properties leased from us  property level rent coverage may not be an appropriate way to evaluate ta ability to pay rents due to us 
we believe property level rent coverage is nonetheless one useful indicator of the performance and value of our properties as we believe it is what an operator interested in acquiring these properties or leaseholds might use to evaluate the contribution of those properties to their earnings before corporate level expenses 
three hundred and eight of our properties  representing of our total historical investments at cost as of december   are operated under seven management arrangements or leases which are subject to full or limited guarantees 
these guarantees may provide us with continued payments if the property level cash flows fail to equal or exceed guaranteed or secured amounts due to us 
our minimum returns and minimum rents for hotels are secured by a security deposit which we control 
some of our managers and tenants  or their affiliates  may also supplement cash flow from our properties in order to make payments to us and preserve their rights to continue operating our 
table of contents properties even if they are not required to do so by guarantees 
guarantee payments  security deposit applications or supplemental payments to us  if any  made under any of our management agreements or leases do not subject us to repayment obligations  but  under some of our agreements  the manager or tenant may recover these guarantee or supplemental payments and the security deposits may be replenished from the future cash flows from our properties after our future minimum returns and minimum rents are paid 
as described above  certain of our agreements are generating cash flows that are less than the minimum amounts contractually required and we have been utilizing the security features and guarantees in our agreements to cover these shortfalls 
however  several of the guarantees and all the security deposits we hold are for limited amounts and are for limited durations and may be exhausted or expire  especially if the us economy does not fully recover from the recent recession in a reasonable time period or if our hotel renovation and rebranding activities described below do not result in improved operating results at these hotels 
accordingly  the effectiveness of our various security features to provide uninterrupted payments to us is not assured 
if any of our hotel managers  tenants or guarantors default in their payment obligations to us  our cash flows will decline 
our operating liquidity and capital resources our principal source of funds for current expenses and distributions to shareholders are minimum returns from our managed hotels and minimum rents from our leased hotels and travel centers 
we receive minimum returns and minimum rents from our managers and tenants monthly 
we receive additional returns  percentage returns and rents and our share of the operating profits of our managed hotels after payment of management fees and other deductions  if any  either monthly or quarterly 
this flow of funds has historically been sufficient for us to pay our operating expenses  interest expenses on our debt and distributions to shareholders declared by our board of trustees 
we believe that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses  interest expense and distribution payments declared by our board of trustees for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future thereafter 
however  because of the impact of the weak us economy on the hotel and travel center industries  our managers and tenants may be unable to pay minimum returns and minimum rents to us when due  in which case our cash flow and net income will decline and we may need to reduce the amount of  or even eliminate  our distributions to common shareholders 
changes in our cash flows for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  were as follows net cash flows provided by operating activities increased from  in to  in  net cash flows used in investing activities increased from  in to  in  and net cash flows provided by used in financing activities increased from  in to  in the increase in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is due primarily to a reduction in the application of security deposits to fund payment shortfalls in  the increase in rental income we received related to our ta leases in compared to  and income from our hotel acquisitions 
the increase in cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is primarily due to our hotel acquisitions  our increased purchases in of improvements under our ta  intercontinental and marriott no 
agreements and the refund in of the security deposit we held for our marriott no 
agreement 
the net increase in cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is primarily a result of the issuance of our senior notes due and our series d cumulative redeemable preferred shares  proceeds from our unsecured term loan  and increased borrowings under our revolving credit facility in  partially offset by the redemption of our series b cumulative redeemable preferred shares and some of our series c cumulative redeemable 
table of contents preferred shares  the repayment of our and senior notes and the repurchase of certain of our convertible senior notes in we maintain our status as a reit under the irc by meeting certain requirements 
as a reit  we do not expect to pay federal income taxes on the majority of our income 
the rma  among other things  allows a reit to lease hotels to a trs if the hotel is managed by an independent third party 
the income realized by our trss in excess of the rent they pay to us is subject to us federal income tax at corporate tax rates 
the income we receive from our hotels in canada and puerto rico is subject to taxes in those jurisdictions and we are subject to taxes in certain states where we have properties 
our provision for tax expense for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  increased by primarily because of higher state taxes imposed despite our tax status as a reit and despite our trs tax loss carry forwards and federal taxes related to our trs that leases the new orleans hotel that we acquired on january  our investment and financing liquidity and capital resources various percentages of total sales at some of our hotels are escrowed as ff e reserves to fund future capital improvements 
during the year ended december   our hotel managers and hotel tenants contributed  to these accounts and  was spent from the ff e reserve escrow accounts and from separate payments by us to renovate and refurbish our hotels 
as of december   there was  on deposit in these escrow accounts  which was held directly by us and is reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as restricted cash 
our hotel operating agreements generally provide that  if necessary  we may provide our managers and tenants with funding for capital improvements to our hotels in excess of amounts otherwise available in escrowed ff e reserves or when no ff e reserves are available 
we make these additional fundings by contributing amounts to the ff e reserve escrow accounts or by purchasing the capital improvements 
to the extent we make such additional fundings  our annual minimum returns or minimum rents generally increase by a percentage of the amount we fund 
during the year ended december   we funded  for capital improvements in excess of ff e reserve fundings available from hotel operations to our hotels as follows during the year ended december   we funded  for improvements to hotels included in our marriott no 
agreement using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we currently do not expect to make fundings for capital improvements materially in excess of amounts available in escrowed ff e reserves under this agreement in pursuant to the june and may agreements we entered with marriott for management of hotels our marriott no 
agreement  we expect to provide an aggregate of  of funding for renovations of certain of these hotels and for other improvements

in january  we entered an agreement to acquire a hotel located in duluth  ga with rooms 
the contract purchase price is  excluding closing costs 
we currently expect to acquire this property during the first quarter of using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
this pending acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions  accordingly  we can provide no assurance that we will acquire the property 
in order to fund capital improvements to our properties and acquisitions and to meet cash needs that may result from timing differences between our receipt of returns and rents and our desire or need to pay operating expenses  debt service and distributions  we maintain a  revolving credit facility 
the maturity date of our revolving credit facility is september  and  subject to the payment of an extension fee and meeting certain other conditions  we have the option to extend the facility for one year to september  in addition  our revolving credit facility includes a feature under which maximum borrowings may be increased to up to  in certain circumstances 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at libor plus a premium which was

both the interest rate premium and the facility fee are subject to adjustment based upon changes to our credit ratings

our revolving credit facility agreement and our term loan agreement provide for acceleration of payment of all amounts due thereunder upon the occurrence and continuation of certain events of default  including a change of control of us and the termination of our business management agreement with rmr 
our revolving credit facility agreement and our term loan agreement also contain a number of covenants  including covenants that restrict our ability to incur debts or to make distributions under certain circumstances and require us to maintain financial ratios and a minimum net worth 
we believe we were in compliance with the terms and conditions of our revolving credit facility agreement and our term loan agreement at december  our term debt maturities other than our revolving credit facility as of december  were as follows  in   in   in   in   in   in and  in our  of convertible senior notes due are convertible into our common shares  if certain conditions are met including certain changes in control  into cash equal to the principal amount of the notes and  to the extent the market price of our common shares exceeds the exchange price of per share  subject to adjustment  either cash or our common shares at our option with a value based on such excess amount 
holders of our convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes on march  and march   or upon the occurrence of certain change in control events 
none of our other debt obligations require principal or sinking fund payments prior to their maturity dates 
we expect to use existing cash balances  the cash flow from our operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and net proceeds of offerings of equity or debt securities to fund future debt maturities  property acquisitions and for other general business purposes 
when significant amounts are outstanding for an extended period of time under our revolving credit facility and as the maturity dates of our revolving credit facility and term debts approach  we currently expect to explore alternatives for the repayment of amounts due or renewal or extension of the maturity dates 
such alternatives in the short term and long term may include incurring additional debt and issuing new equity securities 
we have an effective shelf registration statement that allows us to issue public securities on an expedited basis  but it does not assure that there will be buyers for such securities 
while we believe we will have access to various types of financings  including debt or equity  to fund our future acquisitions and to pay our debts and other obligations  there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any debt or equity offerings or that our cost of any future public or private financings will be reasonable

the amounts in the table reflect these notes in the years category as we expect to be required by their holders to repurchase them on march  of our hotels and of our travel centers are on land leased partially or in its entirety 
in each case the ground lessors are unrelated to us 
generally  payments of ground lease obligations are made by our managers or tenants 
however  if a manager or tenant fails to perform obligations under a ground lease or elects not to renew any ground lease  we might have to perform obligations under the ground lease or renew the ground lease in order to protect our investment in the affected hotel or travel center

on february   we announced that we had entered a letter of intent with nh hoteles  sa  or nh hoteles  under which we would loan nh hoteles  secured by four hotels located in spain hotels  the netherlands hotel and belgium hotel  acquire five hotels located in mexico hotels  colombia hotel  chile hotel and uruguay hotel and form a joint venture with nh hoteles to acquire a hotel in new york city with an aggregate investment for the acquisitions and joint venture interest of approximately  the letter of intent provides for an exclusive negotiating period 
for the joint venture interest  we would fund  to retire the ownership of nh hoteles current partner and fund a major renovation of the hotel that would be owned by the joint venture and the hotel would be branded jointly by nh hoteles and sonesta 
we have not yet begun our diligence for this transaction and the final documentation of this transaction has not yet been agreed 
accordingly  we can provide no assurance that this transaction or any part of it will occur and  because of the preliminary status of our understanding with nh hoteles  we have not included this possible investment in the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or that we expect would be reasonably likely to have a future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 

table of contents debt covenants our debt obligations at december   consist of our revolving credit facility  our  unsecured term loan and  of publicly issued unsecured term debt and convertible notes 
our publicly issued unsecured term debt and convertible notes are governed by an indenture 
this indenture and related supplements and our revolving credit facility and term loan agreements contain a number of financial ratio covenants which generally restrict our ability to incur debts  including debts secured by mortgages on our properties  in excess of calculated amounts  require us to maintain a minimum net worth  restrict our ability to make distributions under certain circumstances and require us to maintain various financial ratios 
as of december   we believe we were in compliance with all of our covenants under our indenture and its supplements and our revolving credit facility and term loan agreements 
neither our indenture and its supplements nor our revolving credit facility or term loan agreements contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings 
however  under our revolving credit facility and term loan agreements  our highest senior unsecured debt rating is used to determine the fees and interest rates we pay 
accordingly  if that debt rating is downgraded by certain credit rating agencies  our interest expense and related costs under our revolving credit facility and term loan would increase 
our public debt indenture and its supplements contain cross default provisions to any other debts of  or more 
similarly  our revolving credit facility agreement and term loan agreement have cross default provisions to other indebtedness that is recourse of  or more and indebtedness that is non recourse of  or more 
related person transactions we have relationships and historical and continuing transactions with our trustees  our executive officers  rmr  ta  sonesta  aic and other companies to which rmr provides management services and others affiliated with them 
for example  we have no employees and personnel and various services we require to operate our business are provided to us by rmr pursuant to management agreements  and rmr is owned by our managing trustees 
also  as a further example  we have or had relationships with other companies to which rmr provides management services and which have trustees  directors and officers who are also trustees  directors or officers of ours or rmr or with entities affiliated with rmr  including ta is our former subsidiary and our largest tenant and we are ta largest shareholder  we acquired two hotels from sonesta and sonesta manages these hotels and others for our trss  we have recently sold two hotels to affiliates of rmr  and we  rmr  ta and five other companies to which rmr provides management services each currently own of aic  an indiana insurance company  and we and the other shareholders of aic have property insurance in place providing  of coverage pursuant to an insurance program arranged by aic and with respect to which aic is a reinsurer of certain coverage amounts 
for further information about these and other such relationships and related person transactions  please see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this annual report on form k  which is incorporated herein by reference  and the section captioned business above in part i  item of this annual report on form k 
in addition  for more information about these transactions and relationships and about the risks that may arise as a result of these and other related person transactions and relationships  please see elsewhere in this annual report on form k  including warning concerning forward looking statements and part i  item a  risk factors 
copies of certain of our agreements with these related parties  including our business management agreement and property management agreement with rmr  various agreements we have entered with ta and sonesta  our purchase and sale agreements with affiliates of rmr and our shareholders agreement with aic and its shareholders  are publicly available as exhibits to our public filings with the sec and accessible at the sec website at www

gov 

table of contents we believe that our agreements with rmr  ta  sonesta and aic are on commercially reasonable terms 
we also believe that our relationships with rmr  ta  sonesta and aic and their affiliated and related persons and entities benefit us and  in fact  provide us with competitive advantages in operating and growing our business 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are those that will have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations and those requiring significant judgments and estimates 
we believe that our judgments and estimates are consistently applied and produce financial information that fairly presents our results of operations 
our most critical accounting policies involve our investments in real property 
these policies affect our classification of leases and the related impact on the recognition of rental income  allocation of purchase prices between various asset categories and the related impact on the recognition of depreciation and amortization expenses  assessment of the carrying values and impairments of real estate and intangible assets  variable interest entities  and income taxes 
certain of our properties are leased on a triple net basis  pursuant to non cancelable  fixed term  operating leases 
each time we enter a new lease or materially modify an existing lease we evaluate its classification as either a capital or operating lease 
the classification of a lease as capital or operating affects the carrying value of a property  as well as our recognition of rental payments as revenue 
these evaluations require us to make estimates of  among other things  the remaining useful life and market value of a leased property  appropriate present value discount rates and future cash flows 
incorrect assumptions or estimates may result in misclassification of our leases 
we allocate the acquisition cost of each property investment to various property components such as land  buildings and equipment and intangibles based on their fair values and each component generally has a different useful life 
for real estate acquired  we record building  land  furniture  fixtures and equipment  and  if applicable  the value of acquired in place leases  the fair market value of above or below market leases and customer relationships at fair value 
we allocate the excess  if any  of the consideration over the fair value of assets acquired to goodwill 
we base purchase price allocations and the determination of useful lives on our estimates and  under some circumstances  studies from independent real estate appraisal firms to provide market information and evaluations that are relevant to our purchase price allocations and determinations of useful lives  however  we are ultimately responsible for the purchase price allocations and determination of useful lives 
we compute depreciation expense using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of up to years for buildings and improvements  and up to years for personal property 
we amortize the value of intangible assets over the shorter of their estimated useful lives  or the term of the respective lease or the affected contract 
we do not depreciate the allocated cost of land 
purchase price allocations and estimates of useful lives require us to make certain assumptions and estimates 
incorrect assumptions and estimates may result in inaccurate depreciation and amortization charges over future periods 
we periodically evaluate our real estate and other assets for possible impairment indicators 
these indicators may include weak or declining operating profitability  cash flow or liquidity  our decision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life or market or industry changes that could permanently reduce the value of our investments 
if indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the carrying value of the related investment by comparing it to the expected future undiscounted cash 
table of contents flows to be generated from that investment 
if the sum of these expected future cash flows is less than the carrying value  we reduce the net carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value 
we test our indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test requires us to determine the estimated fair value of the intangible asset 
an impairment charge is recorded if the fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value 
we determine the fair value for our long lived assets and indefinite lived intangible assets by evaluating recent financial performance and projecting discounted cash flows using standard industry valuation techniques 
these analyses require us to judge whether indicators of impairment exist and to estimate likely future cash flows 
if we misjudge or estimate incorrectly or if future operating profitability  market or industry factors differ from our expectations  we may record an impairment charge which is inappropriate  fail to record a charge when we should have done so or the amount of such charges may be inaccurate 
we have determined that each of our trss is a variable interest entity  or vie  as defined under the consolidation topic of the fasb accounting standards codification tm  or the codification 
we have concluded that we must consolidate each of our trss because we are the entity with the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact such vies performance and we have the obligation to absorb the majority of the potential variability in gains and losses of each vie  with the primary focus on losses  and are therefore the primary beneficiary of each vie 
we account for income taxes in accordance with the income taxes topic of the codification 
under this topic  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we establish valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are expected to be realized when necessary 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the irc and are generally not subject to federal and state income taxation on our operating income provided we distribute our taxable income to our shareholders and meet certain organization and operating requirements 
despite our reit status  we are subject to income tax in canada  puerto rico and in certain states 
further  we lease our managed hotels to our wholly owned trss that  unlike most of our subsidiaries  are generally subject to federal  state and foreign income tax 
our consolidated income tax provision or benefit includes the income tax provision or benefit related to the operations of the trss and state and foreign income taxes incurred by us despite our tax status as a reit 
the income taxes topic also prescribes how we should recognize  measure and present in our financial statements uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in a tax return 
deferred tax benefits are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not that a particular tax position will be sustained upon examination or audit 
to the extent the more likely than not standard has been satisfied  the benefit associated with a tax position is measured as the largest amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
tax returns filed for the through tax years are subject to examination by taxing authorities 
we classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions  if any  in our financial statements as a component of general and administrative expense 
these policies involve significant judgments made based upon experience  including judgments about current valuations  ultimate realizable value  estimated useful lives  salvage or residual value  the ability and willingness of our tenants and operators to perform their obligations to us  and the current and likely future operating and competitive environments in which our properties operate 
in the future  we may need to revise our carrying value assessments to incorporate information which is not now known  and such revisions could increase or decrease our depreciation expense related to properties we own  result in the classification of our leases as other than operating leases or decrease the carrying values of our assets

table of contents impact of inflation inflation in the past several years in the united states has been modest 
future inflation might have either positive or negative impacts on our business 
inflation might cause the value of our real estate to increase 
in an inflationary environment  the percentage returns and rents which we receive based upon a percentage of gross revenues should increase 
offsetting these benefits  inflation might cause our costs of equity and debt capital and operating costs to increase 
an increase in our capital costs or in our operating costs may result in decreased earnings unless it is offset by increased revenues 
in periods of rapid inflation  our managers or tenants operating costs may increase faster than revenues  which may have an adverse impact upon us if the operating income from our properties becomes insufficient to pay our returns or rents and the security features  such as security deposits or guarantees of our returns or rents are exhausted 
to mitigate the adverse impact of any increased cost of debt capital in the event of material inflation  we may enter into interest rate hedge arrangements in the future 
the decision to enter into these agreements will be based on various factors  including the amount of our floating rate debt outstanding  our belief that material interest rate increases are likely to occur  the costs of and our expected benefit from these agreements and upon requirements of our borrowing arrangements 
impact of climate change the current political debate about climate change has resulted in various treaties  laws and regulations which are intended to limit carbon emissions 
we believe these laws being enacted or proposed may cause energy costs at our properties to increase in the future 
regardless  we do not expect the direct impact of any energy increases to be material to our results of operations  because the increased costs either would be the responsibility of our tenants or managers directly or in the longer term  passed through and paid by customers of our properties  although increased cost incurred by our managers may affect their ability to pay us our minimum rents or returns and may prevent or reduce any additional returns we may receive 
although we do not believe it is likely in the foreseeable future  laws enacted to mitigate climate change may make some of our buildings obsolete or cause us to make material investments in our properties which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or the financial condition of our tenants or managers and their ability to pay rent or returns to us 
there have recently been severe weather activities in different parts of the country that some observers believe evidence global climate change  including the recent hurricane sandy that impacted portions of the eastern united states in october such severe weather that may result from climate change may have an adverse effect on individual properties we own 
we mitigate these risks by owning a diversified portfolio of properties and by procuring insurance coverage we believe adequate to protect us from material damages and losses from such activities 
however  there can be no assurance that our mitigation efforts will be sufficient or that storms that may occur due to future climate change or otherwise could not have a material adverse effect on our business 
non gaap measures we provide below calculations of our ffo and normalized funds from operations  or normalized ffo  for the years ended december   and we believe that this data may facilitate an understanding of our consolidated historical operating results 
these measures should be considered in conjunction with net income  net income available for common shareholders  operating income and cash flow from operating activities as presented in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and consolidated statements of cash flows 
these measures do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to net income  net income available to common shareholders  operating income or cash flow from operating activities  determined in accordance with gaap  or as indicators of our financial performance or liquidity  nor are these measures necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all 
table of contents of our needs 
other reits and real estate companies may calculate ffo and normalized ffo differently than we do 
funds from operations and normalized funds from operations we calculate ffo and normalized ffo as shown below 
ffo is calculated on the basis defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit  which is net income  calculated in accordance with gaap  excluding any gain or loss on sale of properties and loss on impairment of real estate assets  plus real estate depreciation and amortization  as well as other adjustments currently not applicable to us 
our calculation of normalized ffo differs from nareit definition of ffo because we include estimated percentage rent in the period to which we estimate that it relates rather than when it is recognized as income in accordance with gaap and exclude excess of liquidation preference over carrying value of preferred shares redeemed  acquisition related costs  loss on extinguishment of debt and loss on impairment of intangible assets 
we consider ffo and normalized ffo to be appropriate measures of operating performance for a reit  along with net income  net income available for common shareholders  operating income and cash flow from operating activities 
we believe that ffo and normalized ffo provide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain historical amounts  such as depreciation expense  ffo and normalized ffo may facilitate a comparison of our operating performance between periods 
ffo and normalized ffo are among the factors considered by our board of trustees when determining the amount of distributions to our shareholders 
other factors include  but are not limited to  requirements to maintain our status as a reit  limitations in our revolving credit facility and term loan agreements and public debt covenants  the availability of debt and equity capital to us  our expectation of our future capital requirements and operating performance  and our expected needs and availability of cash to pay our obligations 
our calculations of ffo and normalized ffo for the years ended december   and and reconciliations of ffo and normalized ffo to net income available for common shareholders  the most directly comparable financial measure under gaap reported in our consolidated financial statements  appear in the following table 
year ended december  net income loss available for common shareholders add depreciation and amortization loss on real estate impairment less gain on sale of real estate ffo add acquisition related costs loss on goodwill impairment loss on extinguishment of debt excess of liquidation preference over carrying value of preferred shares redeemed normalized ffo weighted average shares outstanding net income loss available for common shareholders per share ffo per share normalized ffo per share distributions declared per share 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollar amounts in thousands we are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates 
we manage our exposure to this market risk by monitoring available financing alternatives 
other than as described below  we do not currently foresee any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage this exposure in the near future 
at december   our outstanding publicly tradable debt consisted of six issues of fixed rate  senior unsecured notes and one issue of fixed rate  convertible senior notes  as follows debt principal balance annual interest rate annual interest expense maturity interest payments due unsecured notes   semi annually unsecured notes   semi annually unsecured notes   semi annually unsecured notes   semi annually unsecured notes   semi annually unsecured notes   semi annually convertible unsecured notes  semi annually the convertible senior notes are convertible  if certain conditions are met including certain changes in control  into cash equal to the principal amount of the notes and  to the extent the market price of our common shares exceeds the initial exchange price of per share  subject to adjustment  either cash or our common shares at our option with a value based on such excess amount 
holders of our convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes on march  and march   or upon the occurrence of certain change in control events 
except as described in note to the table above  no principal repayments are due under these notes until maturity 
because these notes bear interest at fixed rates  changes in market interest rates during the term of these debts will not affect our interest obligations 
if these notes were refinanced at interest rates which are basis points higher than the rates shown above  our per annum interest cost would increase by approximately  changes in market interest rates would affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt obligations  increases in market interest rates decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt while decreases in market interest rates increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
based on the balances outstanding at december   and discounted cash flow analyses through the respective maturity dates  and assuming no other changes in factors that may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt obligations  a hypothetical immediate basis point increase in interest rates would change the fair value of those debt obligations by approximately  changes in the trading price of our common shares may also affect the fair value of our convertible senior notes 
each of these fixed rate unsecured debt arrangements allows us to make repayments earlier than the stated maturity date 
we are generally allowed to make prepayments only at a premium equal to a make whole amount  as defined  which is generally designed to preserve a stated yield to the note holder 
also  we have in the past repurchased and retired some of our outstanding debts and we may do so again in the future 
these prepayment rights and our ability to repurchase and retire outstanding debt may afford us opportunities to mitigate the risks of refinancing our debts at their maturities at higher rates by refinancing prior to maturity 
at december   our floating rate debt consisted of  outstanding under our  unsecured revolving credit facility and our  unsecured term loan 
our revolving credit facility matures in september  and subject to our meeting certain conditions  including our 
table of contents payment of an extension fee  we have the option to extend the stated maturity by one year to september no principal repayments are required under our revolving credit facility or term loan prior to maturity  and prepayments may be made  and redrawn subject to conditions at any time without penalty 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan are in us dollars and bear interest at libor plus a premium that is subject to adjustment based upon changes to our credit ratings 
accordingly  we are vulnerable to changes in us dollar based short term interest rates  specifically libor 
there have been recent governmental inquiries regarding the setting of libor  which may result in changes to the process that could have the effect of increasing libor 
in addition  upon renewal or refinancing of our revolving credit facility or our term loan  we are vulnerable to increases in interest rate premiums due to market conditions or our perceived credit risk 
generally  a change in interest rates would not affect the value of this floating rate debt but would affect our operating results 
the following table presents the impact a basis points increase in interest rates would have on our annual floating rate interest expense as of december  impact of increase in interest rates interest rate per year outstanding debt total interest expense per year annual per share impact at december  basis point increase weighted average based on the outstanding borrowings as of december  based on weighted average shares outstanding borrowings as of december  the following table presents the impact that a basis point increase in interest rates would have on our annual floating rate interest expense at december  if we were fully drawn on our revolving credit facility and our term loan remained outstanding impact of increase in interest rates interest rate per year outstanding debt total interest expense per year annual per share impact at december  basis point increase weighted average based on the outstanding borrowings as of december  based on weighted average shares outstanding as of december  the foregoing table shows the impact of an immediate change in floating interest rates 
if interest rates were to change gradually over time  the impact would be spread over time 
our exposure to fluctuations in floating interest rates will increase or decrease in the future with increases or decreases in the outstanding amount under our revolving credit facility or other floating rate debt  if any 
although we have no present plans to do so  we may in the future enter into hedge arrangements from time to time to mitigate our exposure to changes in interest rates
