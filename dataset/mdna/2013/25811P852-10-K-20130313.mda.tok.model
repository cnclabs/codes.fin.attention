mortgage loan underwriting doral bank s underwriting standards are designed to comply with the relevant guidelines set forth by the department of housing and urban development  gnma  rhs  va  fnma  fhlmc  federal and puerto rico banking regulatory authorities  private mortgage investment conduits and private mortgage insurers  as applicable 
doral bank s underwriting policies focus primarily on the borrower s ability to pay and secondarily on collateral value 
the maximum loan to value ratio on conventional first mortgages generally does not exceed 
doral bank also offers certain first mortgage products with higher ltv ratios  which may require private mortgage insurance 
in conjunction with a first mortgage  doral bank may also provide a borrower with additional financing through a closed end second mortgage loan  whose combined ltv ratio exceeds 
doral bank does not originate adjustable rate mortgages or negatively amortizing loans 
however  the company has entered into certain loss mitigation arrangements that provide for a temporary reduction in interest rates and other concessions to increase the likelihood of a full recovery of the loan 
the company uses external credit scores as a useful measure for assessing the credit quality of a borrower 
these scores are supplied by credit information providers  based on statistical models that summarize an individual s credit record 
fico scores  developed by fair isaac corporation  are the most commonly used credit scores 
doral bank sells the majority of its conforming mortgage loan originations and retains the majority of its non conforming loan originations in portfolio 
the company s underwriting process is established to achieve a uniform rules based standard while targeting high quality non conforming loan originations which is consistent with the company s goal of retaining a greater portion of its mortgage loan production 

table of contents 
index to financial statements mortgage loan servicing when doral financial sells originated or purchased mortgage loans  it generally retains the right to service such loans and to receive the associated servicing fees 
doral financial s principal source of servicing rights has traditionally been its mortgage loan production 
the company also seeks to purchase servicing rights in bulk when it can identify attractive opportunities 
doral believes that loan servicing for third parties is important to its asset liability management tools because it provides an asset whose value in general tends to move in the opposite direction to the value of its loan and investment portfolio 
the asset also provides additional fee income to help offset the cost of its mortgage operations 
servicing rights represent a contractual right and not a beneficial ownership interest in the underlying mortgage loans 
failure to service the loans in accordance with contract requirements may lead to the termination of the servicing rights and the loss of future servicing fees 
in general  doral bank s servicing agreements are terminable by the investors for cause 
however  certain servicing arrangements  such as those with fnma and fhlmc  contain termination provisions that may be triggered by changes in the servicer s financial condition that materially and adversely affect its ability to provide satisfactory servicing of the loans 
as of december   approximately  and of doral financial s mortgage loans serviced for others related to mortgage servicing for fnma  fhlmc and gnma  respectively 
as of december   doral bank serviced approximately billion in mortgage loans on behalf of third parties 
termination of doral bank s servicing rights by any of these agencies could have a material adverse effect on doral financial s results of operations and financial condition 
during  no servicing agreements have been terminated 
in certain instances  the company also services loans with no contractual servicing fee 
the servicing asset or liability associated with this type of servicing arrangement is evaluated solely based on ancillary income  float  late fees  prepayment penalties and costs 
doral bank s mortgage loan servicing portfolio is subject to reduction by reason of normal amortization  prepayments and foreclosure of outstanding mortgage loans 
additionally  doral bank may sell mortgage loan servicing rights from time to time to other institutions if market conditions are favorable 
for additional information regarding the composition of doral financial s servicing portfolio as of each of the company s last three fiscal year ends  refer to table k loans serviced for third parties in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in this report 
the degree of credit risk associated with a mortgage loan servicing portfolio is largely dependent on the extent to which the servicing portfolio is non recourse or recourse 
in non recourse servicing  the principal credit risk to the servicer is the cost of temporary advances of funds 
in recourse servicing  the servicer agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans  such as fnma or fhlmc  or with a private investor  insurer or guarantor 
losses on recourse servicing occur primarily when foreclosure sale proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted mortgage loan are less than the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest of such mortgage loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property 
prior to  doral financial often sold non conforming loans on a partial recourse basis 
these recourse obligations were retained by doral financial when doral bank assumed the servicing rights from doral financial 
for additional information regarding recourse obligations  see part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  off balance sheet activities in this report 
sale of loans and securitization activities doral financial sells or securitizes a portion of the residential mortgage loans that it originates and purchases to generate income 
these loans are underwritten to investor standards  including the standards of fnma  fhlmc  and gnma 
as described below  doral financial utilizes various channels to sell its mortgage products 
doral financial issues gnma guaranteed mortgage backed securities  which involve the packaging of fha  rhs or va loans into pools of million or more for sale primarily to broker dealers and other institutional investors 
during the years ended december   and  doral financial issued approximately million  million and million  respectively  in gnma guaranteed mortgage backed securities 

table of contents 
index to financial statements conforming conventional loans are generally either sold directly to fnma  fhlmc or private investors for cash  or are grouped into pools of million or more in aggregate principal balance and exchanged for fnma or fhlmc issued mortgage backed securities  which doral financial sells to broker dealers 
in connection with such exchanges  doral financial pays guarantee fees to fnma and fhlmc 
the issuance of mortgage backed securities provides doral financial with flexibility in selling the mortgage loans that it originates or purchases and also provides income by increasing the value and marketability of such loans 
for the years ended december   and  doral financial securitized approximately million  million and million  respectively  of loans into fnma and fhlmc mortgage backed securities 
in addition  for the years ended december   and  doral financial sold approximately million  million and million  respectively  of loans through the fnma and fhlmc cash window programs 
when the loans backing a gnma security are initially securitized they are treated as sales and the company continues to service the underlying loans 
the company is required to bring individual delinquent gnma loans that it previously accounted for as sold back onto its books as loan assets when  under the gnma mortgage backed securities guide  the loan meets gnma s specified delinquency criteria and is eligible for repurchase 
the rebooking of gnma loans is required together with a liability for the same amount regardless of whether the company  as seller servicer  intends to exercise the repurchase buy back option since the company is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans 
at december   and  the loans held for sale portfolio includes million  million and million  respectively  related to defaulted loans backing gnma securities for which the company has an unconditional option but not an obligation to repurchase the defaulted loans 
payment on these loans is guaranteed by fha 
prior to the fourth quarter of  doral financial s non conforming loan sales were generally made on a limited recourse basis 
as of december   and  doral financial s maximum contractual exposure relating to its portfolio of loans sold with recourse was approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively  which included recourse obligations to fnma and fhlmc as of such dates of approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively 
as of december   and  doral financial had a recourse liability of million  million and million  respectively  to reflect estimated losses from such recourse arrangements 
doral financial estimates its liability from its recourse obligations based on historical losses from foreclosure and disposition of mortgage loans adjusted for expectations of changes in portfolio behavior and market environment 
the company believes that it has an adequate valuation for its recourse obligation as of december  and  but actual future recourse obligations may differ from expected results 
in the past the company sold non conforming loans to financial institutions in the us mainland on a non recourse basis  except recourse for certain early defaults 
since  the company is retaining all of its non conforming loan production in its loan receivable portfolio 
while the company currently anticipates that it will continue to retain its non conforming loan production in portfolio  in the future  the company may seek to continue to diversify secondary market outlets for its non conforming loan products both in the us mainland and puerto rico 
in the ordinary course of business  doral financial makes certain representations and warranties to purchasers and insurers of mortgage loans at the time of the loan sales to third parties regarding the characteristics of the loans sold  and in certain circumstances  such as in the event of early or first payment default 
to the extent the loans do not meet specified criteria  such as a breach of contract of a representation or warranty or an early payment default  doral financial may be required to repurchase the mortgage loan and bear any subsequent loss related to the loan 
doral financial works with purchasers to review the claims and correct alleged documentation deficiencies 
for the years ended december   and  repurchases related to representation and warranties amounted to million  million and million  respectively

index to financial statements puerto rico secondary mortgage market and favorable tax treatment in general  the puerto rico market for mortgage backed securities is an extension of the us market with respect to pricing  rating of investment instruments  and other matters 
however  doral financial has benefited historically from certain tax incentives provided to puerto rico residents to invest in fha and va loans and gnma securities backed by such loans 
under the puerto rico internal revenue code the pr code  the interest received on fha and va loans used to finance the original purchase of newly constructed housing in puerto rico and mortgage backed securities backed by such loans is exempt from puerto rico income taxes 
this favorable tax treatment allows doral financial to sell tax exempt puerto rico gnma mortgage backed securities to local investors at higher prices than those at which comparable instruments trade in the us mainland  and reduces its effective tax rate through the receipt of tax exempt interest 
insurance agency activities in order to take advantage of the cross marketing opportunities provided by financial modernization legislation enacted in  doral financial entered the insurance agency business in puerto rico 
doral insurance agency currently earns commissions by acting as agent in connection with the sale of insurance policies issued by unaffiliated insurance companies 
during  and  doral insurance agency produced insurance fees and commissions of million  million and million  respectively 
doral insurance agency s activities are closely integrated with the company s mortgage loan originations with most policies sold to mortgage customers 
future growth of doral insurance agency s revenues will be tied to the company s level of mortgage originations  its ability to expand the products and services it provides and its ability to cross market its services to doral financial s existing customer base

in computing its interest expense deduction  doral financial s interest deduction is reduced in the same proportion that its average exempt obligations including fha and va loans and gnma securities bear to its average total assets 
therefore  to the extent that doral financial holds fha or va loans and other tax exempt obligations  part of its interest expense may be disallowed for tax purposes

however  in recent years  economic growth in puerto rico has lagged behind growth in the united states 
the dominant sectors of the puerto rico economy in terms of production and income are manufacturing and services 
the manufacturing sector has undergone fundamental changes over the years as a result of an increased emphasis on higher wage  high technology industries  such as pharmaceuticals  biotechnology  computers  microprocessors  professional and scientific instruments  and certain high technology machinery and equipment 
the service sector  including finance  insurance  real estate  wholesale and retail trade  transportation  communications and public utilities  and other services  also plays a major role in the economy 
it ranks second to manufacturing in contribution to puerto rico s gross domestic product  but first in terms of contribution to puerto rico s real gross national product 
the service sector leads all sectors in providing employment 
puerto rico s economy entered into a recession that began in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year that ended june   a fiscal year in which the real gross national product grew by only 
for fiscal years    and  puerto rico s real gross national product decreased by    and  respectively 
according to the puerto rico planning board s latest projections made in april  real gross national product for fiscal years and was expected to increase by and  respectively 
in connection with government transition process hearings held during november  the puerto rico planning board reduced these projections to increases of the real gross national product of and in fiscal years and  respectively 
future growth of the puerto rico economy will depend on several factors including the condition of the united states economy  the relative stability of the price of oil imports  the exchange value of the united states dollar  the level of interest rates  the effectiveness of the recently approved changes to the puerto rico income tax code and other tax laws  and the continuing economic uncertainty generated by the puerto rico government s fiscal condition described below 
fiscal imbalance 
since  puerto rico has faced a number of fiscal challenges  including an imbalance between its general fund total revenues and expenditures 
the imbalance reached its highest level in fiscal year  when the deficit was approximately billion 
in january  the previous puerto rico government administration developed and commenced implementing a multi year plan designed to achieve fiscal balance  restore sustainable economic growth and safeguard the investment grade ratings of the commonwealth bonds 
the plan included certain expense reduction measures that  together with various temporary and permanent revenue raising measures  have allowed the puerto rico government to reduce its deficit during the last three fiscal years by both increasing its revenues and decreasing its expenditures 
the commonwealth s ability to continue reducing the deficit will depend in part on its ability to continue increasing revenues and reducing expenditures  which in turn depends on a number of factors  including improvements in general economic conditions 
economic reconstruction plan 
the previous puerto rico government administration also developed and implemented a short term economic reconstruction plan 
the cornerstone of this plan was the implementation of federal and local economic stimulus programs 
puerto rico was awarded approximately billion in stimulus funds under american recovery and reinvestment act of arra enacted by the us government to provide a stimulus to the us economy in the wake of the global economic downturn 
the arra funds awarded to puerto rico included tax relief  expansion of unemployment benefits and other social welfare provisions  and domestic spending in education  health care  and infrastructure  among other measures 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the previous puerto rico government administration complemented the federal stimulus with additional short and medium term supplemental stimulus measures seeking to address specific local challenges and providing investment in strategic areas 
these measures included a local million economic stimulus plan to supplement the federal plan 
the local stimulus was composed of three main elements i capital improvements  ii stimulus for small and medium sized businesses  and iii consumer relief in the form of direct payments to retirees  mortgage debt restructuring for consumers that face risk of default  and consumer stimulus for the purchase of housing 
economic development plan 
the previous puerto rico government administration also developed what it called the strategic model for a new economy  which is a comprehensive long term economic development plan aimed at improving puerto rico s overall competitiveness and business environment and increasing private sector participation in the puerto rico economy 
the previous administration emphasized the following initiatives to enhance puerto rico s competitive position i overhauling the permitting process  ii reducing energy costs  iii reforming the tax system  iv promoting the development of various projects through public private partnerships  and v implementing strategic initiatives targeted at specific economic sectors and development of certain strategic regional projects 
as part of this plan  the puerto rico government enacted legislation which overhauled the permitting and licensing process in puerto rico in order to provide for a leaner and more efficient process that fosters economic development  and legislation which provided a new energy policy that seeks to lower energy costs and reduce energy price volatility by reducing puerto rico s dependence on fuel oil and the promotion of diverse  renewable energy technologies 
the puerto rico government also enacted legislation establishing a clear public policy and legal framework for the establishment of public private partnerships to finance and develop infrastructure projects and operate and manage certain public assets 
the puerto rico government has already completed the concession of toll roads pr and pr  has awarded contracts for the construction and maintenance of a selected number of public schools throughout puerto rico  and entered into a concession agreement for the luis munoz marin international airport which was approved by the federal aviation administration during the month of february 
another initiative involved a comprehensive review of the commonwealth s income tax system and approval of a tax reform directed at reducing personal and corporate income tax rates 
legislation to implement the first phase of tax reform was enacted as act no 
on november  legislation to implement the second phase of tax reform was enacted as act no 
on january  the tax reform is focused on providing tax relief to individuals and corporations  providing economic development and job creation  simplifying the tax system and reducing tax evasion through enhanced tax compliance measures 
in general terms  the tax reform is intended to be revenue positive for the commonwealth as it includes  among other things  a temporary excise tax on affiliates of multinational manufacturers operating in puerto rico  the elimination of certain incentives and tax credits  and enhanced tax compliance measures to finance the tax rate reductions for corporations and individuals 
the previous puerto rico government administration also identified strategic initiatives to promote economic growth in various sectors of the economy where the commonwealth understands that it has competitive advantages and several strategic regional projects aimed at fostering balanced economic development throughout the island 
these projects  some of which are ongoing  include tourism and urban redevelopment projects 
unfunded pension benefit obligations and funding shortfalls of the retirement systems 
one of the challenges every puerto rico administration has faced during the past twenty years is how to address the growing unfunded pension obligations and funding shortfalls of the three government retirements systems that are funded principally with budget appropriations from the commonwealth s general fund 
as of june   the date of the latest actuarial valuations of the three retirement systems  the unfunded actuarial accrued liability including basic and system administered benefits for the employees retirement system  the teachers retirement system and judiciary retirement system were billion  billion and million  respectively  and the funded ratios were  and  respectively 

table of contents 
index to financial statements based on current employer and member contributions to the retirement systems  the unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities will continue to increase significantly  with a corresponding decrease in their funded ratios  since the annual contributions are not sufficient to fund pension benefits  and thus  are also insufficient to amortize the unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities 
because annual benefit payments and administrative expenses of the retirement systems have been significantly larger than annual employer and member contributions  the retirement systems have been forced to use investment income  borrowings and sale of investment portfolio assets to cover funding shortfalls 
the funding shortfall basic system benefits  administrative expenses and debt service in excess of contributions for fiscal year for the employees retirement system  the teachers retirement system and judiciary retirement system were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
for fiscal year  the funding shortfalls were estimated to be million  million and million  respectively 
as a result  the assets of the retirement systems are expected to continue to decline and eventually be depleted during the next six to nine years 
since the commonwealth and other participating employers are ultimately responsible for any funding deficiency in the three retirement systems  the depletion of the assets available to cover retirement benefits will require the commonwealth and other participating employers to cover such funding deficiency 
it is estimated that the commonwealth would be responsible for approximately of the combined annual funding deficiency of the three retirement systems  with the balance being the responsibility of the municipalities and public corporations 
ultimately  since the commonwealth s general fund is required to cover a significant amount of the funding deficiency  the commonwealth would have difficulty funding the required annual contributions unless it implements significant reforms to the retirement systems  obtains additional revenues  or takes other budgetary measures 
in order to address the growing unfunded benefit obligations and funding shortfalls of the three retirement systems  the previous governor of puerto rico established in february a special commission to make recommendations for improving the fiscal solvency of the three retirement systems 
the special commission delivered its recommendations to the governor in october as a result of the special commission s report and the government s analysis  the previous governor submitted two bills to the legislative assembly to address in part the retirement systems financial condition 
one of the bills was enacted as act no 
and resulted in the transfer of million of funds to the employees retirement system which was invested in capital appreciation bonds issued by puerto rico sales tax financing corporation cofina maturing annually from to and accreting interest at 
the principal of the cofina bonds will grow to approximately billion at their maturity dates 
the second bill was enacted as act no 
and provides for an increase in employer contributions to the employees retirement system and the teachers retirement system of of covered payroll in each of the next five fiscal years and by of covered payroll in each of the following five fiscal years 
as a result of these increases  the employees retirement system and the teachers retirement system would receive approximately million and million  respectively  in additional employer contributions during fiscal year  and the additional employer contributions are projected to increase gradually each fiscal year to million and million  respectively  by fiscal year in addition to these measures  on august   the board of trustees of the employees retirement system adopted a new regulation relating to the concession of personal loans to its members  which  among other changes  lowers the maximum amount of those loans from  to  this change is expected to improve gradually the liquidity of the employees retirement system 
on february  the new puerto rico government announced a series of measures that are being presented to the puerto rico legislature to reform and stabilize the finances of the employees retirement system 
among other things  the proposed reforms would i extend the retirement age for all public employees covered under such plan  ii move public employees from a defined benefit plan to a hybrid plan that includes accrued benefits under the existing defined benefit plan accrual of benefits under the defined plan would end on june  and new benefits to accrue under a new defined contribution plan  iii increase the contributions made by employees to the plan from to of their compensation  and iv modify certain additional benefits given to retired public employees such as summer and christmas bonuses and contributions for medical plan coverage

according to moody s the primary drivers of the downgrade were i puerto rico economic growth prospects remain weak and could be furthered dampened by efforts to control spending and reform its retirement systems  ii debt levels are very high and continue to grow  iii financial performance has been weak  including lackluster revenue growth and large structural budget gaps  and iv lack of meaningful pension reform and no clear timetable to do so

regulation and supervision described below are the material elements of selected federal and puerto rico laws and regulations applicable to doral financial and its subsidiaries 
in general terms  many of these laws and regulations generally aim to protect our depositors and our customers  not necessarily our shareholders or our creditors 
any changes in applicable laws or regulations  and in their application by regulatory agencies  may materially affect our business and prospects 
proposed legislative or regulatory changes may also affect our operations 
the following description summarizes some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject 
references to applicable statutes and regulations are brief summaries  do not purport to be complete  and are qualified in their entirety by reference to such statutes and regulations 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of on july   president obama signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of the dodd frank act 
the dodd frank act has had  and will continue to have  a broad impact on the financial services industry  including significant regulatory and compliance changes such as  
table of contents 
index to financial statements among other things  i enhanced resolution authority of troubled and failing banks and their holding companies  ii increased capital and liquidity requirements  iii increased regulatory examination fees  iv changes to assessments to be paid to the fdic for federal deposit insurance  and v numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of  and strengthening safety and soundness for  the financial services sector 
additionally  the dodd frank act establishes a new framework for systemic risk oversight within the financial system to be distributed among new and existing federal regulatory agencies  including the financial stability oversight council  the federal reserve  the office of the comptroller of the currency  and the fdic 
a summary of certain provisions of the dodd frank act is set forth below  along with information set forth in other parts of this regulation and supervision section 
increased capital standards and enhanced supervision 
the federal banking agencies are required to establish minimum leverage and risk based capital requirements for banks and bank holding companies 
these new standards will be no lower than current regulatory capital and leverage standards applicable to insured depository institutions and may  in fact  be higher when established by the agencies 
the fdic and other federal banking agencies issued a joint notice on june  adopting a final rule that establishes a floor for the risk based capital requirements applicable to the largest  internationally active banking organizations 
the dodd frank act also increases regulatory oversight  supervision and examination of banks  bank holding companies and their respective subsidiaries by the appropriate regulatory agency 
in june  the federal reserve  office of the comptroller of the currency and fdic collectively  the agencies each issued notices of proposed rulemaking nprs that would revise and replace the agencies current capital rules to align them with the basel iii capital standards and meet certain requirements of the dodd frank act 
certain proposed requirements of the nprs would establish more restrictive requirements for instruments to qualify as capital  higher risk weightings for certain asset classes including non performing loans  certain commercial real estate loans  and certain types of residential mortgage loans  capital buffers and higher minimum capital ratios 
the nprs provided for a comment period through october  and the proposals are subject to further modification by the agencies prior to being issued in final form 
the proposals suggested an effective date of january   but on november  the agencies issued a statement saying that given the volume of comments and wide range of views expressed  the agencies did not expect that any of the proposed rules would become effective on january  consumer financial protection bureau cfpb 
the dodd frank act created the cfpb within the federal reserve 
the cfpb is tasked with establishing and implementing rules and regulations under certain federal consumer protection laws with respect to the conduct of providers of certain consumer financial products and services 
the cfpb has rulemaking authority over many of the statutes governing products and services offered to bank consumers 
in addition  the dodd frank act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are more stringent than those regulations promulgated by the cfpb  and state attorneys general are permitted to enforce consumer protection rules adopted by the cfpb against state chartered institutions 
deposit insurance 
the dodd frank act made permanent the  deposit insurance limit for insured deposits 
amendments to the federal deposit insurance act also revised the assessment base against which an insured depository institution s deposit insurance premiums paid to the deposit insurance fund dif will be calculated 
under the amendments  the assessment base will no longer be the institution s deposit base  but rather its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity during the assessment period 
additionally  the dodd frank act made changes to the minimum designated reserve ratio of the dif  increasing the minimum from percent to percent of the estimated amount of total insured deposits and eliminating the requirement that the fdic pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds 
in december  the fdic increased the reserve ratio to percent 
the dodd frank act also provides that depository institutions are now permitted to pay interest on demand deposit accounts  and in this respect the federal reserve approved a final rule repealing regulation q on july  securitization 
the dodd frank act directed the sec and other regulators to prescribe rules seeking to better align the interests of securitizers of asset backed securities with investors and to require more 
table of contents 
index to financial statements disclosure in the securitization process 
the sec has promulgated several rules to implement the aspects of the dodd frank act directed at increasing disclosure in the securitization process 
also  the sec has proposed several rules regarding risk retention requiring securitizers to retain an economic interest in the credit risk generally of any asset transferred to a third party through an asset backed security  conflicts of interest and asset level disclosure 
transactions with affiliates 
the dodd frank act enhances the requirements for certain transactions with affiliates under sections a and b of the federal reserve act  including an expansion of the definition of covered transactions and increasing the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained 
transactions with insiders 
insider transaction limitations are expanded through the strengthening of loan restrictions to insiders and the expansion of the types of transactions subject to the various limits  including derivative transactions  repurchase agreements  reverse repurchase agreements and securities lending or borrowing transactions 
restrictions are also placed on certain asset sales to and from an insider to an institution  including requirements that such sales be on market terms and  in certain circumstances  approved by the institution s board of directors 
enhanced lending limits 
the dodd frank act strengthens the existing limits on a depository institution s credit exposure to one borrower 
current banking law limits a depository institution s ability to extend credit to one person or group of related persons in an amount exceeding certain thresholds 
the dodd frank act expands the scope of these restrictions to include credit exposure arising from derivative transactions  repurchase agreements  and securities lending and borrowing transactions 
compensation practices 
the dodd frank act provides that the appropriate federal regulators must establish standards prohibiting as an unsafe and unsound practice any compensation plan of a bank holding company or other covered financial institution that provides an insider or other employee with excessive compensation or could lead to a material financial loss to such firm 
on march   the fdic and other federal banking and securities agencies issued a joint notice of proposed rulemaking on incentive based compensation arrangements as required by the dodd frank act 
the proposed rule has five key components i requiring the deferral of at least of incentive compensation for a minimum of three years for executive officers of financial institutions with consolidated assets of billion or more  ii prohibiting incentive based compensation arrangements for executive officers  employees  directors and principal shareholders covered persons of financial institutions with more than billion in assets that would encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation  iii prohibiting incentive based compensation arrangements for covered persons of financial institutions with more than billion in assets that would expose the institution to inappropriate risks by providing compensation that could lead to material financial loss  iv requiring policies and procedures of financial institutions with more than billion in assets for incentive based compensation arrangements that are commensurate with the size and complexity of the institution  and v requiring annual reports on incentive compensation structures to the institution s appropriate federal regulator 
debit card interchange fees and routing 
the dodd frank act amended the electronic funds transfer act to  among other things  give the federal reserve the authority to establish rules regarding interchange fees charged for electronic debit transactions by payment card issuers having assets over billion and to enforce a new statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of the transaction to the issuer 
in june the federal reserve issued the final rule  which generally became effective on october   that establishes standards for debit card interchange fees and prohibits network exclusivity arrangements and routing restrictions 
under the new regulation ii  the maximum permissible interchange fee that an issuer may receive for an electronic transaction will be the sum of cents per transaction and basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction 
in accordance with the dodd frank act  issuers that  together with their affiliates  have assets of less than billion are exempt from the debit card interchange fee standards 
the new regulation also prohibits all issuers and networks from restricting the number of networks over which electronic debit transactions may be processed 
table of contents 
index to financial statements to less than two unaffiliated networks 
issuers and networks are also prohibited from inhibiting a merchant s ability to direct the routing of the electronic debt transaction over any network that the issuer has enabled to process them 
we expect that many of the requirements called for in the dodd frank act will be implemented over time  and most will be subject to implementing regulations that will become effective over the course of several years 
given the uncertainty associated with the manner in which the provisions of the dodd frank act will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies and through regulations  the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on financial institutions operations is unclear 
the changes resulting from the dodd frank act may impact the profitability of our business activities  require changes to certain of our business practices  impose upon us more stringent capital  liquidity and leverage ratio requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business 
these changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes in order to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements 
mortgage origination and servicing activities federal regulation doral financial s mortgage origination and servicing operations are subject to the rules and regulations of the cfpb  fha  va  rhs  fnma  fhlmc  hud and gnma with respect to the origination  processing  selling and servicing of mortgage loans and the issuance and sale of mortgage backed securities

mortgage origination activities are subject to  among others  the equal credit opportunity act  federal truth in lending act  the real estate settlement procedures act and the regulations promulgated thereunder which  among other things  prohibit discrimination and require the disclosure of certain basic information to mortgagors concerning credit terms and settlement costs 
the dodd frank act included certain provisions that  upon the approval of final regulations  create certain new standards for residential mortgage lenders 
the principal restrictions are the following i prohibits mortgage lenders and brokers from giving or receiving compensation that varies based on loan terms other than the principal amount of the loan this prohibition effectively eliminates yield spread premiums  ii requires mortgage lenders to determine that the consumer has the reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms based upon a variety of factors including credit history  current income  expected income  and current obligations  and iii creates a safe harbor for mortgage lenders with respect to qualified mortgages a qualified mortgage is a mortgage that meets the following requirements term does not exceed years  the consumer may not defer the payment of principal  points and fees may not exceed of the amount of the loan  negative amortization is not allowed  and no balloon payments are permitted except under certain circumstances 
the federal reserve issued on april  a proposed rule under regulation z that would implement these requirements of the dodd frank act 
the federal reserve noted that this rulemaking would be finalized by the cfpb rather than the federal reserve because rulemaking authority under regulation z was transferred to the cfpb on july  the cfpb issued the final rules on january   which final rules generally become effective on january  the final rule issued by the cfpb establishes a general ability to pay requirement that a creditor shall not make a loan that is a covered transaction includes mortgage loans secured by a dwelling unless the creditor makes a reasonable and good faith determination at or before consummation that the consumer will have a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms

on december   the federal reserve issued proposed rules to strengthen regulation and supervision of large bank holding companies and systemically important nonbank financial firms 
the proposed rules  which include a range of measures addressing issues such as capital  liquidity  concentration and credit exposure limits  stress testing  risk management and early remediation requirements  are mandated by the dodd frank act 
the proposed rules cover a wide  diverse array of regulatory areas  each of which is highly complex 
in some cases the proposed rules would implement financial regulatory requirements being proposed for the first time 
the proposed rules apply to all us bank holding companies with consolidated assets of billion or more and any nonbank financial companies designated by the financial stability oversight council as systemically important nonbank financial companies 
the proposed requirement to conduct annual stress tests would apply to any financial company with more than billion in total consolidated assets that is regulated by a primary federal financial regulatory authority 
the proposed rule also states that the federal reserve may determine that any bank holding company  which is not a covered company under the proposed rule  shall be subject to one or more of the standards established under the proposed rule if the federal reserve determines that doing so is necessary or appropriate to promote the safety and soundness of such bank holding company or to promote financial stability 
the federal reserve is proposing that covered firms would need to comply with many of the enhanced standards a year after the proposed rule is finalized  and that the requirements relating to stress testing to take effect shortly after the proposed rule is finalized 
on october   the federal reserve issued the final rules with the stress testing requirements that  among other things  apply to bank holding companies with more than billion in consolidated assets 
on january   the fdic issued a proposed rule that would require certain large depository institutions to conduct annual capital adequacy stress tests 
the proposed rule  which implements a requirement of the dodd frank act  would apply to state nonmember banks with total consolidated assets of more than billion 
the proposed rule defines stress test as a process to assess the potential impact of economic and financial conditions on the consolidated earnings  losses and capital of a bank over a set planning horizon  taking into account the current condition of the bank and its risks  exposures  strategies  and activities 
the fdic issued on october  the final rule on stress tests for insured state depository institutions with more than billion in consolidated assets 
financial modernization legislation as discussed above  on january   doral financial withdrew its election to be treated as a financial holding company 
under the gramm leach bliley act  bank holding companies  all of whose depository institutions are well capitalized and well managed  as defined in the bhc act  and which obtain satisfactory community reinvestment act ratings  may elect to be treated as financial holding companies fhcs 
fhcs are permitted to engage in a broader spectrum of activities than those permitted to other bank holding companies 
fhcs can engage in any activities that are financial in nature  including insurance underwriting and brokerage  and underwriting and dealing in securities without a revenue limit or other limits applicable to foreign securities affiliates which include puerto rico securities affiliates for these purposes 
as noted above  the withdrawal of financial holding company status has not adversely affected and is not expected to adversely affect doral financial s current operations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the gramm leach bliley act also modified other laws  including laws related to financial privacy and community reinvestment 
the new financial privacy provisions generally prohibit financial institutions  including doral financial s mortgage banking and banking subsidiaries  from disclosing non public personal financial information of customers to third parties unless customers have the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure 
sarbanes oxley act the sarbanes oxley act of sox implemented a range of corporate governance and accounting measures to increase corporate responsibility  to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies  and to protect investors by improving the adequacy and reliability of disclosures under federal securities laws 
in addition  sox established membership requirements and responsibilities for the audit committee  imposed restrictions on the relationship between the public companies and external auditors  imposed additional responsibilities for the external financial statements on the chief executive officer and chief financial officer  expanded the disclosure requirements for corporate insiders  required management to evaluate its disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting  and required the auditors to issue a report on the internal control over financial reporting

capital adequacy under the federal reserve s existing risk based capital guidelines for bank holding companies  the minimum guidelines for the ratio of qualifying total capital total capital to risk weighted assets including certain off balance sheet items  such as standby letters of credit is 
at least half of total capital is to be comprised of common equity  retained earnings  minority interests in unconsolidated subsidiaries  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock  in the case of a bank holding company  less goodwill and certain other intangible assets discussed below tier capital 
the remainder may consist of a limited amount of subordinated debt  other preferred stock  certain other instruments and a limited amount of loan and lease loss reserves tier capital 
in computing total risk weighted assets  bank and bank holding company assets are given risk weights of   and certain non investment grade mortgage backed securities and residual interests have risk weights of 
in addition  certain off balance sheet items are given similar credit conversion factors to convert them to asset equivalent amounts to which an appropriate risk weight will apply 
most loans will be assigned to the risk category  except for performing first mortgage loans fully secured by to family and certain multi family residential property  which carry a risk rating 
most investment securities including  primarily  general obligation claims on states or other political subdivisions of the united states will be assigned to the category  except for municipal or state revenue bonds  which have a risk weight  and direct obligations of the us treasury or obligations backed by the full faith and credit of the us government  which have a risk weight 
in covering off balance sheet items  direct credit substitutes  including general guarantees and standby letters of credit backing financial obligations  are given a conversion factor 
transaction related contingencies such as bid bonds  standby letters of credit backing non financial obligations  and undrawn commitments including commercial credit lines with an initial maturity of more than one year have a conversion factor 
short term commercial letters of credit are converted at and certain short term unconditionally cancelable commitments have a factor 
in addition  the federal reserve has established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies

all other bank holding companies are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 
the guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing significant internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels  without significant reliance on intangible assets 
furthermore  the guidelines indicate that the federal reserve will continue to consider a tangible tier leverage ratio and other indicators of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities 
the tangible tier leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organization s tier capital  less all intangibles  to average total assets  less all intangibles 
the fdic has established regulatory capital requirements for state non member insured banks  such as doral bank  that are substantially similar to those adopted by the federal reserve for bank holding companies 
the consent order with the fdic and the office of the commissioner requires that doral bank submit a written capital plan to the fdic and the office of the commissioner that details the manner in which doral bank shall meet and maintain a tier capital ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least and total risk based capital ratio of at least

please refer to note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
failure to meet minimum regulatory capital requirements could result in the initiation of certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by banking regulators against doral financial and its banking subsidiary that  if undertaken  could have a material adverse effect on doral financial  such as a variety of enforcement remedies  including  with respect to an insured bank  the termination of deposit insurance by the fdic  and to certain restrictions on its business 
see prompt corrective action under fdicia below 
under the dodd frank act  federal banking agencies are required to establish minimum leverage and risk based capital requirements for banks and bank holding companies 
these new standards will be no lower than current regulatory capital and leverage standards currently applicable to insured depository institutions and may  in fact  be higher when established by the federal banking agencies 
the fdic and other federal banking agencies issued a joint notice on june  adopting a final rule that establishes a floor for the risk based capital requirements applicable to the largest  internationally active banking organizations 
basel iii capital standards the current risk based capital guidelines are based upon the capital accord of the international basel committee on banking supervision  a committee of central banks and bank supervisors and regulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines for use by each country s supervisors in determining the supervisory policies they apply 
a new international accord  referred to as basel ii  became mandatory for large or core international banks outside the us in total assets of billion or more or 
table of contents 
index to financial statements consolidated foreign exposures of billion or more and emphasizes internal assessment of credit  market and operational risk  as well as supervisory assessment and market discipline in determining minimum capital requirements 
it is optional for other banks 
in september  the group of governors and heads of supervisors of the basel committee on banking supervision  the oversight body of the basel committee  published its calibrated capital standards for major banking institutions  referred to as basel iii 
under these standards  when fully phased in on january   banking institutions will be required to maintain heightened tier common equity  tier capital  and total capital ratios  as well as maintaining a capital conservation buffer 
the tier common equity and tier capital ratio requirements will be phased in incrementally between january  and january   the deductions from common equity made in calculating tier common equity will be phased in incrementally over a four year period commencing on january   and the capital conservation buffer will be phased in incrementally between january  and january  the basel committee also announced that a countercyclical buffer of to of common equity or other fully loss absorbing capital will be implemented according to national circumstances as an extension of the conservation buffer 
as mentioned above  in june  the agencies each issued nprs that would revise and replace the agencies current capital rules to align them with the basel iii capital standards and meet certain requirements of the dodd frank act 
certain proposed requirements of the nprs would establish more restrictive requirements for instruments to qualify as capital  higher risk weightings for certain asset classes including non performing loans  certain commercial real estate loans  and certain types of residential mortgage loans  capital buffers and higher minimum capital ratios 
the nprs provided for a comment period through october  and the proposals are subject to further modification by the agencies prior to being issued in final form 
the proposals suggested an effective date of january   but on november   the agencies issued a statement saying that given the volume of comments and wide range of views expressed  the agencies did not expect that any of the proposed rules would become effective on january  it is also expected that during  the us bank regulatory agencies will propose liquidity standards for us banking organizations because  under basel iii  these standards will begin to come into effect starting in the liquidity requirements under basel iii relating to liquidity were issued in final form on january  the ultimate impact on doral financial and doral bank of the new capital and liquidity standards that may be adopted cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors  including the final regulatory actions taken by the us bank regulatory agencies 
however  any requirement that doral financial and doral bank maintain more capital  with common equity as a more predominant component  or meet new liquidity requirements  could significantly affect our financial condition  operations  capital position and ability to pursue certain business opportunities 
prompt corrective action under fdicia under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of and the regulations promulgated thereunder fdicia  federal banking regulators must take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
fdicia and the regulations thereunder  establish five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
a depository institution is deemed to be well capitalized if it maintains a leverage ratio of at least  a risk based tier capital ratio of at least and a risk based total capital ratio of at least  and is not subject to any written agreement or regulatory directive to meet a specific capital level 
a depository institution is deemed to be adequately capitalized if it is not well capitalized but maintains a leverage ratio of at least or at least if given the highest regulatory rating and not experiencing or anticipating significant growth  a risk based tier l capital ratio of at least and a risk based total capital ratio of at least 
a depository institution is deemed to be undercapitalized if it fails to meet the standards for adequately capitalized institutions unless it is deemed to be significantly or critically undercapitalized 
an institution is deemed to be significantly undercapitalized if it has a leverage ratio of less than  a risk based tier capital ratio of less than or a risk based total capital ratio of less than 
an institution is deemed to be critically undercapitalized if it has tangible equity equal to or less of total assets 

table of contents 
index to financial statements a depository institution may be deemed to be in a capitalization category that is lower than is indicated by its actual capital position if it receives a less than satisfactory examination rating in any one of four categories 
at december   doral bank met the minimum regulatory capital requirements to be considered well capitalized  and is considered to be adequately capitalized based on the elevated capital requirements of the consent order 
doral bank s capital categories  as determined by applying the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia  may not constitute an accurate representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of doral bank  and should be considered in conjunction with other available information regarding doral bank s financial condition and results of operations 
fdicia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized 
undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the federal reserve system 
in addition  undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans 
a depository institution s holding company must guarantee the capital plan  up to an amount equal to the lesser of i of the depository institution s assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or ii the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan 
the federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining  among other things  that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution s capital 
if a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan  it is treated as if it were significantly undercapitalized 
significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions  including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized  requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks 
critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator 
the capital based prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia and their implementing regulations apply to fdic insured depository institutions such as doral bank  but they are not directly applicable to bank holding companies  such as doral financial  which control such institutions 
however  federal banking agencies have indicated that  in regulating bank holding companies  they may take appropriate action at the holding company level based on their assessment of the effectiveness of supervisory actions imposed upon subsidiary insured depository institutions pursuant to such provisions and regulations 
interstate banking effective june   the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of the riegle neal act amended the fdia and certain other statutes to permit state and national banks with different home states to merge across state lines  with the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency  unless the home state of a participating bank had passed legislation prior to may   expressly prohibiting interstate mergers 
under the riegle neal act amendments  once a state or national bank has established branches in a state  that bank may establish and acquire additional branches at any location in the state at which any bank involved in the interstate merger transaction could have established or acquired branches under applicable federal or state law 
if a state opts out of interstate branching within the specified time period  no bank in any other state may establish a branch in the state which has opted out  whether through an acquisition or de novo 
under the dodd frank act  national banks and state banks are now able to establish branches in any state if that state would permit the establishment of the branch by a state bank chartered in that state 
the amendments now permit a state bank from any state to branch into any other state as if such bank were chartered in that state 
dividend restrictions the company is subject to certain restrictions generally imposed on puerto rico corporations with respect to the declaration and payment of dividends ie  that dividends may be paid out only from the company s net assets in excess of capital or  in the absence of such excess  from the company s net earnings for such fiscal year and or the preceding fiscal year 
the federal reserve has also issued a policy statement saying that  as a matter of prudent banking  a bank holding company should generally not maintain a given rate of cash dividends unless 
table of contents 
index to financial statements its net income available to common shareholders has been sufficient to fund fully the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the organization s capital needs  asset quality  and overall financial condition 
on february   the federal reserve published the applying supervisory guidance and regulations on the payment of dividends  stock redemptions  and stock repurchases at bank holding companies the supervisory letter  which discusses the ability of bank holding companies to declare dividends and to redeem or repurchase equity securities 
the supervisory letter is generally consistent with prior federal reserve supervisory policies and guidance  although it places greater emphasis on discussions with the regulators prior to dividend declarations and redemption or repurchase decisions even when not explicitly required by the regulations 
the federal reserve provides that the principles discussed in the supervisory letter are applicable to all bank holding companies  but are especially relevant for bank holding companies that are experiencing financial difficulties 
the supervisory letter provides that a board of directors should eliminate  defer  or severely limit dividends if i the bank holding company s net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters  net of dividends paid during that period  is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends  ii the bank holding company s rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with capital needs and overall macroeconomic outlook  or iii the bank holding company will not meet  or is in danger of not meeting  its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios 
the supervisory letter further suggests that bank holding companies should inform the federal reserve in advance of paying a dividend that i exceeds the earnings for the quarter in which the dividend is being paid  or ii could result in a material adverse change to the organization s capital structure 
the payment of dividends to doral financial by doral bank may be affected by regulatory requirements and policies  such as the maintenance of adequate capital 
if  in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority  a depository institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in  or is about to engage in  an unsafe or unsound practice which  depending on the financial condition of the depository institution  could include the payment of dividends  such authority may require  after notice and hearing  that such depository institution cease and desist from such practice 
the fdic has indicated that the payment of dividends would constitute unsafe and unsound practice if the payment would deplete a depository institution s capital base to an inadequate level 
moreover  the federal reserve and the fdic have issued policy statements that generally provide that insured banks and bank holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings 
in addition  all insured depository institutions are subject to the capital based limitations required by fdicia 
please refer to prompt corrective action under fdicia above for additional information 
the consent order and the written agreement prohibit doral bank from paying dividends to doral financial without obtaining prior written approval from the fdic  the office of the commissioner and the frbny  and the written agreement prohibits doral financial from paying dividends to its stockholders without the prior written approval of the frbny and the director of the division of bank supervision and regulation of the federal reserve 
please refer to regulation and supervision banking activities puerto rico regulation  below  for a description of certain restrictions on doral bank s ability to pay dividends under puerto rico law 
fdic insurance assessments the deposits of doral bank are insured by the deposit insurance fund of the fdic  and are therefore subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments 
as mentioned above  the dodd frank act permanently raised the basic limit on deposit insurance by the fdic from  to  the coverage limit is per depositor  per insured depository institution for each account ownership category 
the dodd frank act also set a new minimum dif reserve ratio at of estimated insured deposits 
the fdic is required to attain this ratio by september  on october  the fdic stated that it had updated its loss  income and reserve ratio projections for the dif over the next several years and concluded that 
table of contents 
index to financial statements the dif reserve ratio is on track to meet the minimum target of by september  in december  the fdic approved a final rule raising its industry target ratio of reserves to insured deposits to  basis points above the statutory minimum of  but at the time the fdic noted that it does not project that goal to be met until in addition  the dodd frank act has had a significant impact on the calculation of deposit insurance assessment premiums going forward 
specifically  the dodd frank act generally requires the fdic to define the deposit insurance assessment base for an insured depository institution as an amount equal to the institution s average consolidated total assets during the assessment period minus average tangible equity rather than the previous assessment based on the institution s insured deposits 
the fdic issued a final rule that implements this change to the assessment calculation on february  as done under the previous rule  the assessment rate of a depository institution will be determined according to its supervisory ratings and capital levels  with adjustments for the depository institution s unsecured debt and brokered deposits 
the deposit insurance rates for depository institutions under the new rule range from to cents per of the assessment base average consolidated assets minus average tangible equity 
the new rule became effective for the quarter beginning april   and was reflected in the june  fund balance and the invoices for assessments due september  the fdic rule also provides the fdic s board with the flexibility to adopt actual rates that are higher or lower than the total base assessment rates adopted without notice and comment  if certain conditions are met 
under the fdia  the fdic also has the authority to impose special assessments upon insured depository institutions when deemed necessary by the fdic s board 
on november   the fdic adopted the final rule implementing a prepayment assessment for the fourth quarter of and for all of  and in order to strengthen the cash position of the dif 
doral s total prepaid assessment was million  which according to the final rule was recorded as a prepaid expense as of december  the prepaid assessment was amortized and recognized by doral financial as an expense over the period from to the deposit insurance funds act of separated the financing corporation fico assessment to service the interest on its bond obligations from the dif assessments 
the amount assessed on individual institutions by fico is in addition to the amount  if any  paid for deposit insurance according to the fdic s risk related assessment rate schedules 
the current fico annual assessment rate is cents per of the assessment base average consolidated assets minus average tangible equity 
these assessments will continue until fico bonds mature in as of december   doral bank had an fdic insurance assessment base of approximately billion 
community reinvestment under the community reinvestment act cra  each insured depository institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation  consistent with the safe and sound operation of such institution  to help meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for such institutions nor does it limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community  consistent with the cra 
the cra requires each federal banking agency  in connection with its examination of an insured depository institution  to assess and assign one of four ratings to the institution s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such records into account in its evaluation of certain applications by the institution  including application for charters  branches and other deposit facilities  relocations  mergers  consolidations  and acquisitions of assets or assumptions of liabilities 
the cra also requires that all institutions make public disclosure of their cra ratings 
doral bank received a rating of satisfactory as of the most recent cra report of the fdic

if an insured depository institution fails to meet any of the standards described above  it may be required to submit to the appropriate federal banking agency a plan specifying the steps that will be taken to cure the deficiency 
if the depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan or fails to implement the plan  the appropriate federal banking agency will require the depository institution to correct the deficiency and  until it is corrected  may impose other restrictions on the depository institution  including any of the restrictions applicable under the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia 
the fdic and other federal banking agencies have adopted interagency guidelines establishing standards for safety and soundness that  among other things  set forth standards relating to internal controls  information systems and internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  employee compensation and benefits  asset growth and earnings 
interagency appraisal and evaluation guidelines in december  the federal banking agencies issued the interagency appraisal and evaluation guidelines 
this guidance  which updated guidance originally issued in  sets forth the minimum regulatory standards for appraisals 
it incorporates previous regulatory issuances affecting appraisals  addresses advances in information technology used in collateral evaluation  and clarifies standards for use of analytical methods and technological tools in developing evaluations 
this guidance also requires institutions to utilize strong internal controls to ensure reliable appraisals and evaluations and periodically update valuations of collaterals for existing real estate loans and transactions 
brokered deposits fdic regulations adopted under fdicia govern the receipt of brokered deposits by insured depository institutions 
under these regulations  a bank cannot accept  roll over or renew brokered deposits which term is defined also to include any deposit with an interest rate more than basis points above certain prevailing rates specified by regulation unless i it is well capitalized  or ii it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the fdic 
a bank that is adequately capitalized may not pay an interest rate on any deposits in excess of basis points over certain prevailing market rates specified by regulation 
there are no such restrictions on a bank that is well capitalized 
as of december  and  doral bank had a total of approximately billion and billion of brokered deposits  respectively 
doral bank generally uses brokered deposits as a source of less costly funding 
doral bank s liquidity relies in part upon brokered deposits 
under the consent order doral bank must obtain a waiver from the fdic prior to accepting  renewing or rolling over any brokered deposits 
if the fdic does not approve the acceptance  renewal or rolling over of brokered deposits  or limits doral bank s ability in any material way  doral bank s liquidity  operations and ability to meet its obligations will be materially adversely affected

these sections are important statutory provisions designed to protect a depository institution from transferring to its affiliates the subsidy arising from the institution s access to the federal safety net on deposits 
an affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls  is controlled by or is under common control with the bank 
generally  section a limits the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate to an amount equal to of the bank s capital stock and surplus  and limits such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to of the bank s capital stock and surplus  and requires that all such transactions be on terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
the term covered transactions includes the making of loans  purchase of or investment in securities issued by the affiliate  purchase of assets  issuance of guarantees and other similar types of transactions 
most loans by a bank to any of its affiliates must be secured by collateral in amounts ranging from to percent of the loan amount  depending on the nature of the collateral 
in addition  section b requires that any covered transaction by a bank with an affiliate and any sale of assets or provision of services to an affiliate must be on terms that are substantially the same  or at least as favorable to the bank  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies 
regulation w of the federal reserve comprehensively implements sections a and b 
the regulation unified and updated federal reserve board staff interpretations issued over the years prior to its adoption  incorporated several interpretative proposals such as to clarify when transactions with an unrelated third party will be attributed to an affiliate  and addressed issues arising as a result of the expanded scope of non banking activities engaged in by banks and bank holding companies and authorized for financial holding companies under the gramm leach bliley act 
the dodd frank act also changed the definition of covered transaction in sections a and b and established limitations on asset purchases from insiders 
with respect to the definition of covered transaction  the dodd frank act defines that term to include the acceptance of debt obligations issued by an affiliate as collateral for a bank s loan or extension of credit to another person or company 
in addition  a derivative transaction with an affiliate is now deemed to be a covered transaction to the extent that such a transaction causes a bank or its subsidiary to have a credit exposure to the affiliate 
a separate provision of the dodd frank act states that an insured depository institution may not purchase an asset from  or sell an asset to a bank insider or their related interests unless the transaction is conducted on market terms between the parties  and if the proposed transaction represents more than of the capital stock and surplus of the insured depository institution  it has been approved in advance by a majority of the insured depository institution s non interested directors 
sections g and h of the federal reserve act set forth restrictions on loans by a bank to its executive officers  directors  and principal shareholders 
regulation o of the federal reserve board implements these provisions 
under section h and regulation o  loans to a director  an executive officer and to a greater than shareholder of a bank and certain of their related interests insiders  and insiders of its affiliates  may not exceed  together with all other outstanding loans to such person and related interests  the bank s single borrower limit generally equal to of the institution s unimpaired capital and surplus 
section h and regulation o also require that loans to insiders and to insiders of affiliates be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons  unless the loans are made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that i is widely available to employees of the bank and ii does not give preference to insiders over other employees of the bank 
section h and regulation o also require prior board of directors approval for certain loans  and the aggregate amount of extensions of credit by a bank to all insiders cannot exceed the institution s unimpaired capital and surplus 
furthermore  section g and regulation o place additional restrictions on loans to executive officers

doral bank entered into the consent order with the fdic and the office of the commissioner on august   and doral financial entered into the written agreement with the frbny on september  the consent order and the written agreement impose operating restrictions and conditions on doral bank and doral financial 
both the consent order and the written agreement increase the reporting obligations of doral financial and doral bank to their regulators 
we anticipate that we will need to continue to dedicate significant resources to our efforts to comply with the consent order and the written agreement  which are expected to increase our operational costs and adversely affect the amount of time our management has to conduct our business 
the additional operating costs to comply with  and the restrictions under  the consent order and the written agreement will adversely affect doral financial s results of operations

if we fail to comply with the consent order or the written agreement in the future  or if  in the opinion of the frbny  fdic  or the office of the commissioner  our financial condition has significantly deteriorated  we may become subject to additional regulatory enforcement actions up to and including the appointment of a receiver or conservator for doral bank 
doral financial and doral bank are subject to the supervision and regulation of various banking regulators and have entered into the written agreement and the consent order with these regulators  and these regulators could take additional actions against doral financial or doral bank

doral financial s banking regulators could take additional actions to protect doral bank or to ensure that the holding company remains as a source of financial and managerial strength to doral bank  and such actions could have adverse effects on doral financial 
our ability to diversify our business operations by expanding in the united states is dependent upon approval of our operating plans by the frbny  the fdic and or the office of the commissioner 
if we do not continue to receive the approval of the frbny  the fdic and or the office of the commissioner to develop our operations in the united states our business and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
because of the weak economic conditions in puerto rico we are diversifying our business operations through the development of our banking operations in new york and florida 
currently  approximately of all our assets are in new york and florida 
because doral financial is party to the written agreement with the frbny and doral bank is party to the consent order with the fdic and the office of the commissioner  we may be required to seek approval to take some actions under our operating plans  including developing our banking operations in new york and florida 
if the frbny  the fdic and or the office of the commissioner do not approve the continued development of our banking operations in new york and florida  our business and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
doral bank is required to obtain the approval from the fdic prior to accepting  renewing or rolling over any brokered deposits 
if the fdic does not allow doral bank to accept  renew or rollover any brokered deposits  doral bank may not be able to meet its liquidity needs or future obligations 
doral bank s liquidity relies in part upon brokered deposits 
under the consent order with the fdic  doral bank must obtain a waiver from the fdic prior to accepting  renewing or rolling over any brokered deposits 
if the fdic does not approve the acceptance  renewal or rolling over of brokered deposits  or limits doral bank s ability in any material way  doral bank s liquidity  operations and ability to meet its obligations will be materially adversely affected 
our decisions regarding credit risk and the allowance for loan and lease losses may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
if we need to materially increase our allowance for loan and lease losses  our business and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
making loans is an essential element of our business  and there is a risk that the loans will not be repaid 
this default risk is affected by a number of factors  including the duration of the loan  credit risk of a particular borrower  changes in economic or industry conditions  and in the case of a collateral loan  risks resulting from uncertainties about the future value of collateral 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we strive to maintain an appropriate allowance for loan and lease losses to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
we periodically determine the amount of the allowance based on consideration of several factors such as default frequency  internal risk ratings  expected future cash collections  loss recovery rates  severity experience  fair value estimates and general economic factors  among others 
we establish a provision for loan losses  which leads to reductions in our income from operations  in order to maintain our allowance for inherent losses at a level which we deem to be appropriate based upon an assessment of the quality of our loan portfolio 
the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates and judgments regarding credit risks and future trends  all of which may undergo substantial changes 
we believe our allowance for loan and lease losses is currently sufficient given the constant monitoring of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio 
however  there is no precise method of predicting loan losses and therefore we always face the risk that charge offs in future periods will exceed the allowance for loan and lease losses and that additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan and lease losses will be required 
in addition  the fdic as well as the office of the commissioner may require us to establish additional reserves 
additions to the allowance for loan and lease losses would adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition 
deteriorating credit quality has adversely impacted us and may continue to adversely impact us 
we have experienced a downturn in credit quality since our credit quality has continued to be under pressure during as a result of continued recessionary conditions in puerto rico and the recent slow down in consumer activity and economic growth in the united states that have led to  among other things  higher unemployment levels  much lower absorption rates for new residential construction projects and further declines in property values 
we expect that credit conditions and the performance of our loan portfolio may continue to deteriorate in the near future 
our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers and counterparties and the value of the assets securing our loans or underlying our investments 
if the credit quality of the customer base materially decreases  if the risk profile of a market  industry or group of customers changes materially  our business  financial condition  allowance levels  asset impairments  liquidity  capital and results of operations could be adversely affected 
changes in collateral values of properties located in distressed economies may require increased reserves 
substantially all of our loans are located within the boundaries of the united states economy 
whether the collateral for a loan is located in puerto rico or the united states mainland  the performance of our loan portfolio and the collateral value backing the loan transactions are dependent upon the performance of and conditions within each specific real estate market 
puerto rico has been in recessionary conditions since sustained weak economic conditions that have affected puerto rico and the united states over the last several years have resulted in declines in collateral values 
we measure the impairment of a loan based on the fair value of the collateral  if collateral dependent  which is generally obtained from appraisals 
updated appraisals are requested when we determine that loans are impaired and are updated annually thereafter 
in addition  appraisals are also obtained for certain residential mortgage loans on a spot basis based on specific characteristics such as delinquency levels  age of the appraisal and ltv ratios 
the appraised value of the collateral may decrease or we may not be able to recover collateral at its appraised value 
a significant decline in collateral valuations for collateral dependent loans may require increases in our specific provision for loan losses and an increase in the general valuation allowance 
any such increase would have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations 
interest rate shifts may reduce net interest income 
shifts in short term interest rates may reduce net interest income  which is the principal component of our earnings 
net interest income is the difference between the amounts received by us on our interest earning assets and the interest paid by us on our interest bearing liabilities 
when interest rates rise  the rate of interest we pay on our liabilities generally rises more quickly than the rate of interest that we receive on our interest bearing 
table of contents 
index to financial statements assets  which may cause our profits to decrease 
the impact on earnings is more adverse when the slope of the yield curve flattens  that is  when short term interest rates increase more than long term interest rates or when long term interest rates decrease more than short term interest rates 
increases in interest rates may reduce the value of our holdings of securities and demand for our mortgage and other loans 
fixed rate securities acquired by us are generally subject to decreases in market value when interest rates rise  which may require recognition of a loss eg  the identification of other than temporary impairment on our investments portfolio  thereby adversely affecting our results of operations 
market related reductions in value also influence our ability to finance these securities 
higher interest rates also increase the cost of mortgage and other loans to consumers and businesses and may reduce demand for such loans  which may negatively impact our profits by reducing the amount of our loan origination income 
doral financial and doral bank are subject to regulatory capital adequacy and other supervisory guidelines  and if we fail to meet those guidelines our business and financial condition would be adversely affected 
under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements  doral financial and doral bank must meet guidelines that include quantitative measures of assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items  subject to quantitative judgments by regulators regarding components  risk weightings and other factors 
supervisory guidelines also address  among other things  asset quality and liquidity 
if either doral financial or doral bank fail to meet these minimum capital adequacy requirements or any other supervisory and regulatory requirements including those requirements set forth in the consent order and the written agreement  our business and financial condition will be adversely affected 
a failure to meet regulatory capital adequacy guidelines  among other things  would further affect doral bank s ability to accept or rollover brokered deposits and could result in additional supervisory actions by federal and or puerto rico banking authorities 
the hedging transactions that we enter into may not be effective in managing the exposure to interest rate risk 
we use derivatives  to a limited extent  to manage part of our exposure to market risk caused by changes in interest rates 
the derivative instruments that we may use also have their own risks  which include i basis risk  which is the risk of loss associated with variations in the spread between the asset yield and funding and or hedge cost  ii credit or default risk  which is the risk of insolvency or other inability of the counterparty to a particular transaction to perform its obligations  and iii legal risk  which is the risk that we are unable to enforce the terms of such instruments 
all or any of these risks could expose us to losses 
our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented  our risk management policies and procedures may be inadequate and operational risk could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 
we may fail to identify and manage risks related to a variety of aspects of our business  including  but not limited to  operational risk  interest rate risk  trading risk  fiduciary risk  legal and compliance risk  liquidity risk and credit risk 
we have adopted various controls  procedures  policies and systems to monitor and manage risk  and we currently believe that our risk management policies and procedures are effective 
nonetheless  if our risk management controls  procedures  policies and systems  including those designed to protect our networks  systems  computers and data from attack  damage or unauthorized access  were to fail or be circumvented  we could incur losses or suffer reputational damage or find ourselves out of compliance with applicable regulatory mandates or expectations 
some of our methods for managing risks and exposures are based upon the use of observed historical market behavior or statistics based upon historical models 
as a result  these methods may not fully predict future exposures  which could be significantly greater than our historical measures indicate 
other risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets  clients or other matters that is publicly available or otherwise accessible to us 
this information may not always be accurate  complete  up to date or properly evaluated 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we may also be subject to disruptions from external events that are wholly or partially beyond our control  which could cause delays or disruptions to operational functions  including information processing and financial market settlement functions 
in addition  our customers  vendors and counterparties could suffer from such events 
should these events affect us  or the customers  vendors or counterparties with which we conduct business  our consolidated results of operations could be adversely affected 
when we record balance sheet reserves for probable loss contingencies related to operational losses  we may be unable to accurately estimate our potential exposure  and any reserves we establish to cover operational losses may not be sufficient to cover our actual financial exposure  which may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition for the periods in which we recognize the losses 
a breach in the security of our systems could disrupt our business  result in the disclosure of confidential information  damage our reputation and create significant financial and legal exposure for us 
our businesses are dependent on our ability and the ability of our third party service providers to process  record and monitor a large number of transactions 
if the financial  accounting  data processing or other operating systems and facilities fail to operate properly  become disabled  experience security breaches or have other significant shortcomings  we could be materially adversely affected 
although we and our third party service providers devote significant resources to maintain and upgrade our systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of computer systems  software  networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality  integrity and availability of information belonging to us and our customers  there is no assurance that our security systems and those of our third party service providers will provide absolute security 
financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems  some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information  destroy data  disable or degrade service  or sabotage systems  often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware  cyber attacks and other means 
despite our efforts and those of our third party service providers to ensure the integrity of these systems  it is possible that we or our third party service providers may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types  especially because techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched  and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources 
a successful breach of the security of our systems or those of our third party service providers could cause serious negative consequences to us  including significant disruption of our operations  misappropriation of our confidential information or the confidential information of our customers  or damage to our computers or operating systems  and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws  financial loss to us or to our customers  loss in confidence in our security measures  customer dissatisfaction  litigation exposure  and harm to our reputation  all of which could have a material adverse effect on us 
we could incur increased costs or reductions in revenue or suffer reputational damage in the event of misuse of information 
our operations rely on the secure processing  transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks regarding our customers and their accounts 
to provide these products and services  we use information systems and infrastructure that we and third party service providers operate 
as a financial institution  we also are subject to and examined for compliance with an array of data protection laws  regulations and guidance  as well as to our own internal privacy and information security policies and programs 
information security risks for financial institutions like us have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies  the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime  hackers and other external parties 
our technologies and systems may become the target of cyber attacks or other attacks that could result in the misuse or destruction of our or our customers confidential  proprietary or other information or that could result in disruptions to the business operations of us or our customers or other third parties 
also  our customers  in order to access some of our products and services  may use personal computers  smart mobile 
table of contents 
index to financial statements phones  tablet pcs and other devices that are beyond our controls and security systems 
further  a breach or attack affecting one of our third party service providers or partners could impact us through no fault of our own 
in addition  because the methods and techniques employed by perpetrators of fraud and others to attack systems and applications change frequently and often are not fully recognized or understood until after they have been launched  we and our third party service providers and partners may be unable to anticipate certain attack methods in order to implement effective preventative measures 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible security breach of our information systems  if unauthorized persons were somehow to get access to confidential or proprietary information in our possession or to our proprietary information  it could result in significant legal and financial exposure  damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in the security of our systems that could adversely affect our business 
the preparation of our financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make significant estimates that affect our financial statements 
three of doral financial s most critical estimates are the level of the allowance for loan and lease losses  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights and the reserve for deferred tax assets 
due to the inherent nature of these estimates we may significantly increase the allowance for loan and lease losses and or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance  and may recognize a significant provision for impairment of our mortgage servicing rights 
if doral financial s allowance for loan and lease losses turns out to be insufficient to cover actual losses in our loan portfolio  our business  financial condition  including our liquidity and capital  and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
additionally  in the future  doral financial may have to increase its allowance for loan and lease losses  which could have a material adverse effect on its capital and results of operations 
maintaining deferred tax assets without reserves requires generation of future taxable income levels that provides for use of the deferred tax assets in the future 
defective and repurchased loans may harm our business and financial condition 
in connection with the sale and securitization of mortgage loans  we are generally required to make a variety of customary representations and warranties regarding us and the loans being sold or securitized 
our obligations with respect to these representations and warranties are generally outstanding for the life of the loan  and they relate to  among other things compliance with laws and regulations  underwriting standards  the accuracy of information in the loan documents and loan file  and the characteristics and enforceability of the loan 
a loan that does not comply with these representations and warranties may take longer to sell  may impact our ability to obtain third party financing for the loan  and be unsalable or salable only at a significant discount 
if such a loan is sold before we detect a noncompliance  we may be obligated to repurchase the loan and bear any associated loss directly  or we may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any such loss  either of which could reduce our cash available for operations and liquidity 
our management believes that it has established controls to ensure that loans are originated in accordance with the secondary market s requirements  but mistakes may be made  or certain employees may deliberately violate our lending policies 
we seek to minimize repurchases and losses from defective loans by correcting flaws  if possible  and selling or re selling such loans 
we do not have a reserve on our financial statements for possible losses related to repurchases resulting from representation and warranty violations because we do not expect any such losses to be significant 
losses associated with defective loans may adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we are exposed to credit risk from mortgage loans held pending sale and mortgage loans that have been sold subject to recourse arrangements 
we are generally at risk for mortgage loan defaults from the time we fund a loan until the time the loan is sold or securitized into a mortgage backed security 
in the past  we retained  through recourse arrangements  part of the credit risk on sales of mortgage loans that did not qualify for gnma  fnma or fhlmc sale or exchange programs and consequently may suffer losses on these loans 
we suffer losses on these loans when the proceeds from a foreclosure sale of the property underlying a defaulted mortgage loan are less than the outstanding principal balance of the loan and the costs of holding and disposing of the related property 
we estimate the fair value of the retained recourse obligation or of any liability incurred at the time of sale  and include such obligation with the net proceeds from the sale  resulting in lower gain on sale recognition 
we evaluate the fair value of our recourse obligation based on historical losses from foreclosure and disposition of mortgage loans adjusted for expectations of changes in portfolio behavior and market environment 
we are subject to risks in servicing loans for others 
our profitability may also be adversely affected by mortgage loan delinquencies and defaults on mortgage loans that we service for third parties 
under many of our servicing contracts  we must advance all or part of the scheduled payments to the owner of an outstanding mortgage loan  even when mortgage loan payments are delinquent 
in addition  in order to protect their liens on mortgaged properties  owners of mortgage loans usually require that we  as servicer  pay mortgage and hazard insurance and tax payments on schedule even if sufficient escrow funds are not available 
we generally recover our advances from the mortgage owner or from liquidation proceeds when the mortgage loan is foreclosed 
however  in the interim  we must absorb the cost of the funds we advance during the time the advance is outstanding 
we must also bear the costs of attempting to collect on delinquent and defaulted mortgage loans 
in addition  if a default is not cured  the mortgage loan will be canceled as part of the foreclosure proceedings and we will not receive any future servicing income with respect to that loan 
as a result of our credit ratings  we may be subjected to increased collateral requirements and other measures that could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
we have previously sold or securitized mortgage loans in transactions with fnma and other counterparties subject to partial or full recourse 
as of december   the maximum contractual exposure to us if we were required to purchase all loans sold subject to partial or full recourse was million  million of which consisted of exposure to fnma 
our contractual agreements with fnma authorize fnma to require us to post additional collateral to secure our recourse obligations with fnma  and fnma has the contractual right to request collateral for the full amount of our recourse obligations when  as now  we do not maintain an investment grade rating 
in january  we agreed to post with fnma million in collateral to secure our recourse obligations  and currently have million pledged to fnma as collateral 
in addition  certain of our servicing agreements  such as those with fnma  fhlmc  and gnma  contain provisions triggered by changes in our financial condition or failure to maintain required credit ratings 
we do not currently maintain the credit ratings required by gnma and possibly other counterparties  which may result in increased collateral requirements and or require us to engage a substitute fund custodian  or could result in termination of our servicing rights 
termination of our servicing rights  requirements to post additional collateral or the loss of custodian funds could reduce our liquidity and have an adverse impact on our operating results 
our ability to sell loans and other mortgage products to government sponsored entities could be impacted by changes in our financial condition or the historical performance of our mortgage products 
our ability to sell mortgage products to government sponsored entities gses  such as fnma  fhlmc and gnma  depends  among other things  on our financial condition and the historical performance of our mortgage products 
to protect our ability to continue to sell mortgage products to gnma and other gses  we have and may in the future repurchase defaulted loans from such counterparties 
during and  we repurchased million and million  respectively  of defaulted fha guaranteed loans from gnma 
any 
table of contents 
index to financial statements such repurchases in the future may negatively impact our liquidity and operating results 
termination of our ability to sell mortgage products to the gses would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we may fail to retain and attract key employees and management personnel 
our success has been and will continue to be influenced by our ability to retain and attract key employees and management personnel  including senior and middle management 
our ability to attract and retain key employees and management personnel may be adversely affected as a result of the workload and stress associated with our business transformation efforts  and related regulatory risks and uncertainties  and the consolidation of the puerto rico banking industry 
competition with other financial institutions could adversely affect the profitability of our operations 
we face significant competition from other financial institutions  many of which have significantly greater assets  capital and other resources 
as a result  many of our competitors have advantages in conducting certain businesses and providing certain services 
this competitive environment could force us to increase the rates we offer on deposits or lower the rates we charge on loans and  consequently  could adversely affect the profitability of our operations 
damage to our reputation could damage our businesses 
maintaining a positive reputation for doral financial is critical to our ability to attract and maintain customers  investors and employees 
damage to our reputation can therefore cause significant harm to our business and prospects 
harm to our reputation can arise from numerous sources  including  among others  employee misconduct  litigation or regulatory outcomes  failing to deliver minimum standards of service and quality  compliance failures  unethical behavior  and the activities of customers and counterparties 
negative publicity regarding doral financial  whether or not true  may also result in harm to our prospects 
we must respond to rapid technological changes  and these changes may be more difficult or expensive than anticipated 
if competitors introduce new products and services embodying new technologies  or if new industry standards and practices emerge  our existing product and service offerings  technology and systems may become obsolete 
further  if we fail to adopt or develop new technologies or to adapt our products and services to emerging industry standards  we may lose current and future customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the financial services industry is changing rapidly and in order to remain competitive  we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our products  services and technologies 
these changes may be more difficult or expensive than we anticipate 
in addition  our networks  systems  computers and data could become vulnerable to attack  damage or unauthorized access as a result of rapid technological changes 
doral financial has been the subject of an investigation by the us attorney s office for the southern district of new york  which could require it to pay substantial fines or penalties 
on august   doral financial received a grand jury subpoena from the us attorney s office for the southern district of new york regarding the production of certain documents  including financial statements and corporate  auditing and accounting records prepared during the period relating to the restatement of doral financial s financial statements 
doral financial cannot predict when this investigation will be completed or what the results of this investigation will be 
the effects and results of this investigation could have a material adverse effect on doral financial s business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
adverse developments related to this investigation  including any expansion of its scope  could negatively impact doral financial and could divert efforts and attention of its management team from doral financial s ordinary business operations 
doral financial may be required to pay material fines  judgments or settlements or suffer other penalties  each of which could have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 

table of contents 
index to financial statements this investigation could adversely affect doral financial s ability to obtain  and or increase the cost of obtaining  directors and officers liability insurance and or other types of insurance  which could have a material adverse effect on doral financial s businesses  results of operations and financial condition 
doral financial may be required to advance significant amounts to cover the reasonable legal and other expenses of its former officers and directors 
under doral financial s by laws  doral financial is obligated to pay in advance the reasonable expenses incurred by former officers and directors in defending civil or criminal actions or proceedings pending final disposition of such actions 
since  doral financial has been advancing funds on behalf of various former officers and directors in connection with the grand jury proceeding referred to above and investigations by the sec relating to the restatement of doral financial s financial statements 
on march   a former treasurer of doral financial was indicted for alleged criminal violations involving securities and wire fraud 
on april   the former treasurer of doral financial was convicted on three of the five counts of securities and wire fraud he was facing after a five week jury trial  which conviction he is appealing 
on august   the former treasurer of doral financial filed a complaint against doral financial in the supreme court of the state of new york 
the complaint alleges that doral financial breached a contract with the plaintiff and doral financial s by laws by failing to advance payment of certain legal fees and expenses that the former treasurer has incurred in connection with a criminal indictment filed against him in the us district court for the southern district of new york 
further  the complaint claims that doral financial fraudulently induced the plaintiff to enter into agreements concerning the settlement of a civil litigation arising from the restatement of doral financial s financial statements for fiscal years through the complaint seeks declaratory relief  damages  costs and expenses 
the former treasurer further moved for preliminary injunctive relief 
on december   the parties entered into a settlement agreement 
on december   the former treasurer s motion for a preliminary injunction was denied as moot  and all further proceedings were stayed  but the procedures for future disputes between the parties outlined in the settlement agreement were not affected by the stay 
the amounts required to be advanced in an appeal of the criminal conviction could be substantial and could materially adversely affect doral financial s results of operations 
our businesses may be adversely affected by litigation 
from time to time  our customers  or the government on their behalf  may make claims and take legal action relating to our performance of fiduciary or contractual responsibilities 
we may also face employment lawsuits or other legal claims 
in any such claims or actions  demands for substantial monetary damages may be asserted against us resulting in financial liability or an adverse affect to our reputation among investors or to customer demand for our products and services 
we may be unable to accurately estimate our exposure to litigation risk when we record balance sheet reserves for probable loss contingencies 
as a result  any reserves we establish to cover any settlements or judgments may not be sufficient to cover our actual financial exposure  which may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
in the ordinary course of our business  we are also subject to various regulatory  governmental and law enforcement inquiries  investigations and subpoenas 
these may be directed generally to participants in the businesses in which we are involved or may be specifically directed at us 
in regulatory enforcement matters  claims for disgorgement  the imposition of penalties and the imposition of other remedial sanctions are possible 
the resolution of legal actions or regulatory matters  if unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for the period in which such actions or matters are resolved or a reserve is established 
risks related to the general business environment and our industry our credit quality may continue to be adversely affected by puerto rico s recessionary economic conditions 
because a majority of our business activities and credit exposure are still concentrated in puerto rico  our financial condition and results of operations are highly dependent on economic conditions in puerto rico 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the economy of puerto rico entered into a recession in the fourth quarter of the government s fiscal year ended june  for fiscal years    and  puerto rico s real gross national product decreased by    and  respectively 
according to the projections of the puerto rico planning board  a government agency  made in november  real gross national product for fiscal years and is expected to increase by and  respectively  although there can be no assurance this will prove accurate 
the long recession in puerto rico has resulted in  among other things  a reduction in lending activity and an increase in the rate of default in commercial loans  commercial real estate loans  construction loans  consumer loans and residential mortgages 
we have also experienced significant losses on our puerto rico loan portfolio due to a higher level of defaults on commercial loans  commercial real estate loans  construction loans  consumer loans and residential mortgages 
the prolonged recessionary economic environment in puerto rico accelerated the devaluation of properties and increased portfolio delinquency when compared with previous periods 
the continuation of the economic slowdown would cause those adverse effects to continue  as delinquency rates may continue to increase in the short term  until sustainable growth of the puerto rico economy resumes 
also  potential reduction in consumer spending as a result of continued recessionary conditions may also impact growth in our other interest and non interest revenue sources 
additional economic weakness in puerto rico and the us mainland could further pressure residential property values  loan delinquencies  foreclosures and the cost of repossessing and disposing of real estate collateral 
our business concentration in puerto rico imposes risks 
we conduct our operations in a geographically concentrated area  as our main market is in puerto rico 
this imposes risks from lack of diversification in the geographical portfolio 
our financial condition and results of operations are highly dependent on the economic conditions of puerto rico  where adverse political development  continued recessionary economic conditions or natural disasters  among other things  could affect the volume of loan originations  increase the level of non performing assets  increase the rate of foreclosure losses and reduce the value of our loans and loan servicing portfolio 
difficult market conditions have already affected us and our industry and may continue to adversely affect us 
given that almost all of our business is in puerto rico and the united states and given the degree of interrelation between puerto rico s economy and that of the united states  we are particularly exposed to downturns in the united states economy 
dramatic declines in the united states housing market over the past few years  with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures  unemployment and under employment  have negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage loans and resulted in significant write downs of asset values by financial institutions  including government sponsored entities as well as major commercial banks and investment banks 
these write downs  initially of mortgage backed securities but spreading to credit default swaps and other derivative and cash securities  in turn  have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital from private and government entities  to merge with larger and stronger financial institutions and  in some cases  to fail 
this market turmoil and tightening of credit led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies  lack of consumer confidence  increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity generally 
the resulting economic pressure on consumers and lack of confidence in the financial markets has already adversely affected our industry and has and may continue to adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we experienced increased levels of non performing assets and otti charges and losses on our non agency mortgage backed securities as a result of past market conditions 
a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on us and others in the financial institutions industry 
in particular  we may face the following risks in connection with these events our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select  manage  and underwrite our customers become less predictive of future behaviors 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the processes and models we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure requires difficult  subjective  and complex judgments  including forecast of economic conditions and how these economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans  which may no longer be capable of accurate estimation and which may  in turn  impact the reliability of the processes and models 
regulatory agency views of market conditions and the effect of market conditions on our borrowers may differ from those of our management  and such variance in views  if any  may contribute to increases in charge offs and loan loss provisions 
our ability to borrow from other financial institutions or to engage in sales of mortgage loans to third parties including mortgage loan securitization transactions with government sponsored entities on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by further disruptions in the capital markets or other events  including deteriorating investor expectations 
competition in our industry could intensify as a result of increasing consolidation of financial services companies in connection with current market conditions 
we expect to face increased regulation of our industry 
compliance with such regulation may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities 
we may be required to pay in the future significantly higher fdic assessments to insure our deposits if our fdic assessment ratings continue to deteriorate or if market conditions do not improve or worsen 
we may face higher credit losses because of federal or state legislation or regulatory action that either i reduces the amount that our borrowers are required to pay us  or ii limits our ability to foreclose on properties or collateral or makes foreclosures less economically viable 
if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen  our ability to access capital and our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
we have been and could continue to be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions 
the united states and other countries recently faced a severe economic crisis  including a major recession 
these adverse economic conditions have negatively affected  and are likely to continue to negatively affect for some time  our assets  including our loans and securities portfolios  capital levels  results of operations and financial condition 
in response to the economic crisis  the united states and other governments established a variety of programs and policies designed to mitigate the effects of the crisis 
these programs and policies appear to have stabilized the severe financial crisis that occurred in the second half of  but the extent to which these programs and policies will assist in an economic recovery or may lead to adverse consequences  whether anticipated or unanticipated  is still unclear 
if these programs and policies are ineffective in bringing about an economic recovery or result in substantial adverse developments  the economic conditions may again become more severe  or adverse economic conditions may continue for a substantial period of time 
in addition  economic uncertainty that may result from the downgrading of united states long term debt  from the fiscal imbalances in federal  state and local municipal finances combined with the political difficulties in resolving these imbalances  and from the debt and other economic problems of several european countries  may directly or indirectly adversely impact economic conditions faced by us and our customers 
any increase in the severity or duration of adverse economic conditions  including a double dip recession in the united states or a further delay in the economic recovery of puerto rico  would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our business could be adversely affected if we cannot maintain access to stable funding sources 
the credit markets  although recovering  have experienced extreme volatility and disruption in recent years 
at times during the past few years  the volatility and disruptions reached unprecedented levels 
in some cases  the markets have exerted downward pressure on availability of liquidity and credit capacity of certain issuers  particularly for non investment grade issuers like us 
our business requires continuous access to various funding sources 
we need liquidity to  among other things  pay our operating expenses  pay interest on our debt  maintain our lending and investment activities and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements replace certain maturing liabilities 
without sufficient liquidity  we may be forced to curtail our operations 
the availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions  the general availability of credit and our credit capacity 
our cash flows and financial condition could be materially affected by disruptions in the financial markets 
we are generally able to fund our operations through deposits as well as through advances from the fhlb and other alternative sources such as repurchase agreements  loans and brokered deposits 
we expect to have continued access to credit from the foregoing sources of funds 
however  there can be no assurance that such financing sources will continue to be available or will be available on favorable terms 
in a period of financial disruption  or if negative developments occur with respect to us  the availability and cost of funding sources could be adversely affected 
our efforts to monitor and manage liquidity risk may not be successful to deal with dramatic or unanticipated changes in the global markets or other reductions in liquidity driven by us or market related events 
in the event that such sources of funds are reduced or eliminated and we are not able to replace them on a cost effective basis  we may be forced to curtail our loan origination and investment activities  which would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 
brokered deposits are typically sold through an intermediary to retail investors 
our ability to continue to attract brokered deposits is subject to variability based on a number of factors  including volume and volatility in the global markets  our credit rating and the relative interest rates that we are prepared to pay for these liabilities 
brokered deposits are generally considered a less stable source of funding than core deposits obtained through retail bank branches 
investors in brokered deposits are generally more sensitive to interest rates and will generally move funds from one depository institution to another based on small differences in interest rates on deposits 
an unforeseen disruption in the brokered deposits market  stemming from factors such as legal  regulatory or financial risks  could adversely affect our ability to fund a portion of our operations and or meet obligations 
recent and or future us credit downgrades or changes in outlook by major credit rating agencies may have an adverse effect on financial markets  including financial institutions and the financial industry 
on august   standard and poor s downgraded the united states long term debt rating from its aaa rating to aa 
on august   standard and poor s downgraded from aaa to aa the credit ratings of certain long term debt instruments issued by fannie mae and freddie mac and other united states government agencies linked to long term united states debt 
it is difficult to predict the effect of these actions  or any future downgrades or changes in outlook by standard poor s or either of the other two major credit rating agencies 
however  these events could impact the trading market for united states government securities  including agency securities  and the securities markets more broadly  and consequently could impact the value and liquidity of financial assets  including assets in our investment portfolio 
these actions could also create broader financial turmoil and uncertainty  which may negatively affect the global banking system and limit the availability of funding  including borrowing under repurchase agreements  at reasonable terms 
in turn  this could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial condition and results of operations 
the soundness of other financial institutions could affect us 
our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty and other relationships 
we have exposure to different industries and counterparties  and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  investment banks  investment companies and other institutional clients 
in certain of these transactions  we are required to post collateral to secure our obligations to the counterparties 
in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding involving one of such counterparties  we may experience delays in recovering the assets posted as collateral or may incur a loss to the extent that the counterparty was holding collateral in excess of the obligation to such counterparty 
many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by our counterparty or client 
in addition  our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is 
table of contents 
index to financial statements liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us 
any such losses could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
monetary policies and regulations of the federal reserve could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to being affected by general economic conditions  our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the federal reserve 
an important function of the federal reserve is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions 
among the instruments used by the federal reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in us government securities  adjustments of the discount rate and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits 
these instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit  bank loans  investments and deposits 
their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits 
the monetary policies and regulations of the federal reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
the effects of such policies upon our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adverse 
our income and cash flows depend to a great extent on the difference between the interest rates earned on interest earning assets such as loans and investment securities  and the interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies in particular  the federal reserve 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  will influence the origination of loans  the prepayment speed of loans  the value of loans  investment securities and mortgage servicing assets  the purchase of investments  the generation of deposits  and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits or other sources of funding 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act will affect our business 
on july   president obama signed into law the dodd frank act 
some of the provisions of the legislation have already become effective 
other provisions will have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates  and will be required to be implemented through regulatory action of various federal regulatory authorities 
because many of the provisions require future regulatory actions for their implementation  the ultimate impact of the legislation on the financial services industry and on our business  are not completely known at this time 
the implementation of many of the provisions of the legislation will affect our business and are expected to add new regulatory risk and compliance burdens and costs on the financial services industry and us 
the implementation of this legislation could result in loss of revenue  limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities we might otherwise consider engaging in  impact the value of some of the assets we hold  require us to change certain of our business practices  impose additional costs on us  establish more stringent capital  liquidity and leverage ratio requirements  or otherwise adversely affect our business 
implementation of basel iii could reduce our regulatory capital ratios and increase regulatory capital requirements 
in june  agencies issued nprs that would revise and replace the agencies current capital rules to align with the basel iii capital standards and meet certain requirements of the dodd frank act 
certain requirements of the proposed nprs would establish more restrictive requirements for instruments to qualify as capital  higher risk weightings for certain asset classes including non performing loans  certain commercial real estate loans  and certain types of residential mortgage loans  capital buffers and higher minimum capital ratios 
the proposed nprs provided for a comment period through october  and the proposals are subject to further modification by the agencies prior to being issued in final form 
the proposals suggested an effective date of january   but on november  the agencies issued a statement saying that given the volume of comments and wide range of views expressed  the agencies did not expect that any of the proposed rules would become effective on january  the proposed revisions would  among other things  include implementation of a new common equity tier minimum capital requirement and apply limits on a banking organization s capital distributions and certain 
table of contents 
index to financial statements discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a specified amount of common equity tier capital in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk based capital requirements 
the nprs also would establish more conservative standards for including an instrument in regulatory capital 
the revisions set forth in these nprs are consistent with section of the dodd frank act  which requires the agencies to establish minimum risk based and leverage capital requirements 
the agencies are also proposing to revise their rules for calculating risk weighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity and address weaknesses identified over recent years 
the revisions include methodologies for determining risk weighted assets for residential mortgages  securitization exposures  and counterparty credit risk 
the implementation of the nprs as proposed could reduce our regulatory capital ratios 
we operate within a highly regulated industry and our business and results are significantly affected by the regulations to which we are subject  changes in statutes and regulations could adversely affect us 
we operate within a highly regulated environment 
the regulations to which we are subject will continue to have a significant impact on our operations and the degree to which we can grow and be profitable 
certain regulators which supervise us have significant power in reviewing our operations and approving our business practices 
these powers include the ability to place limitations or conditions on activities in which we engage or intend to engage 
particularly in recent years  our businesses have experienced increased regulation and regulatory scrutiny  often requiring additional resources 
we are also subject to the requirements and limitations of the consent order and the written agreement 
if we do not comply with governmental regulations and other supervisory requirements  we may become subject to fines  penalties  lawsuits or material restrictions on our businesses in the jurisdiction where the violation occurred  which may adversely affect our business operations 
in addition  new proposals for legislation continue to be introduced in the united states congress or the puerto rico legislature that could further increase regulation of the financial services industry and impose restrictions on the operations and general ability of firms within the industry to conduct business consistent with historical practices 
federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied 
we cannot predict the substance or impact of any change in regulation  whether by regulators or as a result of legislation enacted by the united states congress or by the puerto rico legislature  or in the way such statutory or regulatory requirements are interpreted or enforced 
compliance with such current and potential regulation and scrutiny may significantly increase our costs  impede the efficiency of our internal business practices  require us to increase our regulatory capital and limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities in an efficient manner 
further increases in the fdic insurance assessment premiums or required reserves may have a significant impact on us 
the fdic insures deposits at fdic insured depository institutions up to certain limits 
the fdic charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the dif 
recent economic conditions have resulted in higher bank failures and expectations of future bank failures 
in the event of a bank failure  the fdic takes control of a failed bank and ensures payment of deposits up to insured limits which were permanently increased to  by the dodd frank act using the resources of the dif 
the fdic is required by law to maintain adequate funding of the dif  and the fdic may increase premium assessments to maintain such funding 
the dodd frank act requires the fdic to increase the dif s reserves against future losses  which will necessitate increased deposit insurance premiums 
in october  the fdic addressed plans to bolster the dif by increasing the required reserve ratio for the industry to percent ratio of reserves to insured deposits by september   as required by the dodd frank act 
in december  the fdic approved a final rule raising its industry target ratio of reserves to insured deposits to percent  basis points above the statutory minimum  but the fdic does not project that goal to be met until on february   the fdic approved a final rule that amended the deposit insurance assessment regulations 
the final rule implemented a provision in the dodd frank act that changes the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums from one based on domestic deposits to one based on average consolidated total 
table of contents 
index to financial statements assets minus average tier capital 
the final rule also changed the assessment rate schedules for insured depository institutions so that approximately the same amount of revenue would be collected under the new assessment base as would be collected under the then current rate schedule and the schedules previously proposed by the fdic in october we are generally unable to control the amount of assessments that we are required to pay for fdic insurance 
if there are additional bank or financial institution failures  or if our risk rating deteriorates for purposes of determining the level of our fdic insurance assessments  we may be required to pay even higher fdic insurance assessments than the recently increased levels 
any future increases in fdic insurance assessments may materially adversely affect our results of operations 
the consolidation of the puerto rico banking industry as a result of bank failures in may adversely affect us 
in april  the fdic closed three puerto rico banks and sold some of their assets and liabilities to other banks in puerto rico 
in the future  there may be additional bank failures  mergers and acquisitions in our industry 
any business combinations could significantly alter industry conditions and competition within the puerto rico banking industry and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the strategies adopted by the fdic and the three acquiring banks in connection with some of the residential  construction and commercial real estate loans acquired may adversely affect residential and commercial real estate values in puerto rico 
this in turn may adversely affect the value of some of our residential  construction and commercial real estate loans  and our ability to sell or restructure some of our residential  construction and commercial real estate loans 
changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board or other standard setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements 
our financial statements are subject to the application of us gaap  which is periodically revised and or expanded 
accordingly  from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards and updates thereto issued by fasb 
market conditions have prompted accounting standard setters to promulgate new requirements that further interpret or seek to revise accounting pronouncements related to financial instruments  structures or transactions as well as to revise standards to expand disclosures 
the impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed by us in footnotes to our financial statements included in our filings with the sec 
an assessment of proposed standards and updates thereto is not provided as such proposals are still subject to change

net loss attributable to common shareholders for the year ended december  totaled million  and resulted in a net loss per share of  compared to a net loss attributable to common shareholders for the corresponding and periods of million and million  and a loss per share of and  respectively 
the significant events or transactions that have influenced the company s financial results for the year ended december  included the following net interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million and million for the corresponding and periods  respectively

doral financial s provision for loan and lease losses for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million and million for the corresponding and periods  respectively 
the provision for loan and lease losses in resulted from i million for non guaranteed residential loans as new loans became delinquent  previously delinquent loans reached later delinquency stages and valuations were received on properties securing loans more than days past due  ii million from construction and land largely due to valuations on properties collateralizing impaired loans and continued deterioration of loan performance  iii million for

non interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million and a non interest loss of million for the corresponding and periods  respectively 
the million decrease in non interest income during when compared to resulted largely from the following i a decrease of million in gain on sale of investment securities available for sale  ii a decrease of million in servicing income mostly related to a decrease of million in the change in the fair value of the servicing asset  and iii a decrease of million in net gains from trading activities resulting mainly from a decrease of million in gain on io valuation and a million increase in losses from hedging activities 
non interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million increase in non interest expense during  compared to  was due largely to i an increase of million in oreo expenses mainly due to an increase of million in the provision for oreo losses  ii an increase of million in professional services mostly related to non recurring professional service expenses incurred to perform certain reviews under the supervision of the company s board of directors and legal expenses relating to commercial loan workouts  iii an increase of million in compensation and benefits mostly related to additional headcount in the us operations and growth in the pr collections efforts as well as stock based compensation of million  iv an increase of million in electronic data processing expenses mostly related to outsourcing of the retail banking core application process  v an increase of million in occupancy related to new leases lease contracts for the company s us operations and vi an increase of million in fdic insurance expense as a result of the increase in the assessment rate 
income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  compared to an income tax expense of million and million for the corresponding and periods 
the improvement in income tax expense benefit of million is due mainly to the release of valuation allowance of million as the company entered into a closing agreement with the commonwealth of puerto rico related to certain tax payments from prior years and a million deferred tax benefit recorded during the fourth quarter of that resulted from the release of a portion of the deferred tax assets valuation allowance at doral financial corporation  based on our evaluation of all available evidence in determining whether the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets at doral financial corporation was needed

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make a number of judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  income and expenses in the company s consolidated financial statements 
various elements of the company s accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
understanding the company s accounting policies and the extent to which the company uses management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company provides a summary of its significant accounting policies in note summary of significant accounting policies to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company has identified the following accounting policies as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters 
the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on the company s reported results of operations or financial condition 
these critical accounting policies govern income recognition allowance for loan and lease losses fair value mortgage servicing rights and retained interests mortgage loan repurchase losses income taxes the company evaluates its critical accounting policies and judgments on an ongoing basis  and updates them as necessary based on changing conditions 
management has reviewed and approved these critical accounting policies and has discussed these policies with the audit and risk committees of the board of directors 
the company believes that the judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances as of december  income recognition on loans accrual status the company recognizes interest income on loans receivable on an accrual basis unless it is determined that collection of all contractual principal or interest is unlikely 
the company discontinues accrual recognition of interest income on loans when the full and timely collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain  generally when a loan receivable is days delinquent on principal or interest 
the company discontinues accrual recognition of interest income when a mortgage loan is four payments ten payments for mortgage loans insured by fha va past due for interest or principal 
loans determined to be well collateralized such that the ultimate collection of principal and interest is not in question for example  when the outstanding loan and interest balance as a percentage of current collateral value is less than are not placed on non accrual status  and the company continues to accrue interest income on that loan 

table of contents 
index to financial statements when the company places a loan on non accrual status  it reverses the accrued unpaid interest receivable against interest income in that period  and suspends amortization of any net deferred fees or costs 
interest income on a non accrual loan is recognized under the cash basis method ie income recognized when an interest payment is received  if ultimate collection of principal is not in doubt 
if the ultimate collectability of a non accrual loan is in doubt  interest received is applied as a reduction to principal  in accordance with the cost recovery method 
the determination as to the ultimate collectability of the loan involves significant management judgement based upon consideration of collateral valuation  delinquency status  and knowledge of specific borrower circumstances 
non accrual loans may be restored to accrual status when all delinquent principal and interest becomes current under the terms of the loan agreement  or when the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection and the collectability of remaining principal and interest is no longer doubtful 
the determination of restoring a non accrual loan to accrual status involves significant management judgement and is based on recent collateral valuations  recent payment performance  borrowers other assets  and knowledge of specific borrower circumstances 
upon returning a loan to accrual status  previously reversed  non accrued interest is credited to income in the period of recovery 
restoring accrual income recognition on tdr loans residential or other consumer or commercial loan modifications are returned to accrual status when the criteria for returning a loan to performing status are met refer to doral s non accrual policies previously described 
loan modifications also increase doral s interest income by returning a non performing loan to performing status and cash flows by providing for payments to be made by the borrower  and decreases foreclosure and real estate owned costs by decreasing the number of foreclosed properties 
doral continues to report a modified loan considered to be a tdr as a non performing asset until the borrower has made at least six contractual payments after the modification and is current in accordance with the modification terms 
at such time the loan will not be reported as a non performing asset and will be treated as any other performing tdr loan 
effective january   doral changed how it reports the balance of loans considered tdrs 
modified loans including mortgage loans which have reset are removed from amounts reported as tdrs  but continue to be accounted for as tdrs  if a they were modified during the prior year  b they have made at least six consecutive payments in accordance with their modified terms  and c the effective yield was at least equal to the market rate of similar credit at the time of modification 
in addition to these  the loan must not have a payment reset pending 
prior period balances were not adjusted in order to reflect this change 
effective january   doral changed how it estimates whether a tdr performing loan is accounted for as a non accrual loan 
doral s non accrual loans now include loans that are performing  but which have been modified to temporarily or permanently reduce the payment amount  and such current monthly payment is at least or more lower than the payment prior to reset and either the borrower s mortgage debt service to income ratio exceeds or the property loan to value is greater than 
doral believes loans meeting the defined criteria are at greater risk of not being able to meet their contractual obligations in the future and therefore are reported as non accrual 
allowance for loan and lease losses the company maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses to absorb probable credit related losses inherent in the portfolio of loans receivable as of each balance sheet date 
the allowance involves significant management judgment and consists of specific and general components based on the company s assessment of default probabilities  internal risk ratings based on borrowers financial stability  external credit ratings  management strength  earnings and operating environment  probable loss and recovery rates  and the degree of risk inherent in the loans receivable portfolio 
the allowance is maintained at a level that the company considers appropriate to absorb probable losses 
loans or portions of loans estimated by management to be uncollectible are charged to the allowance for loan and lease losses 
recoveries on loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
provisions for loan and lease losses are charged to expenses and credited to the alll in amounts estimated by management 
table of contents 
index to financial statements based upon its evaluation of the known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
while management believes that the current alll is maintained at a level believed appropriate to provide for inherent probable losses in the loan portfolio  future additions to the allowance may be necessary 
if economic conditions or borrower behavior deviate substantially from the assumptions used by the company in determining the allowance for loan and lease losses  further increases in the allowance may be required 
the company estimates and records its alll on a quarterly basis 
management estimates the alll separately for each product and geography  and combines the amounts in reaching its estimate for the full portfolio 
alll includes both unimpaired and impaired loans  but excludes loans that are carried at fair value  or subject to lower of cost or market  as the fair value of these loans as such loans are measured at the lower of amortized cost or fair value already reflect a credit component 
on an ongoing basis  management monitors the loan portfolio and evaluates the adequacy of the alll 
in determining the adequacy of the alll  management considers such factors as default probabilities  internal risk ratings  probable loss and recovery rates  cash flow forecasts and the degree of risk inherent in the loan portfolios 
management s loss reserve estimate for performing loans is assessed based upon i the probability of the performing loan defaulting at some future period  ii the likelihood of the loan curing or resuming payment versus the likelihood of the collateral being foreclosed upon and sold or a short sale  and iii doral s historical experience of recoveries on sale of oreo related to the contractual principal balance at the time the collateral is repossessed 
during the first quarter of  doral reviewed its alll estimate assumptions and calculations  and adopted a more conservative outlook as to future loan performance considering new information developed during the quarter  and the uncertain economic and regulatory environments 
the resulting changes in estimate are reflected in the provision and allowance for loan and lease losses 
significant changes in assumptions and calculations include reducing the definition of a defaulted loan by days  increasing the expectation that long term delinquent loans are foreclosed  emphasizing the consideration of more recent experience in determining the probability of default and loss given default  adjusting factors considered in estimating the expected loss and reducing the estimated prepayment speed on tdr loans 
the company also adopted a more conservative view on the estimated collectability of significantly aged residential mortgage loans and began utilizing a market analysis on land use completed in late march which provides information necessary for appraisers to value undeveloped land in puerto rico 
for non performing loans  the reserve is estimated either by i considering the loans current level of delinquency and the probability that the loan will be foreclosed upon from that delinquency stage  and the loss that will be realized assuming foreclosure mortgage loans  ii considering the loans book value less discounted forecasted cash flows  or iii measuring impairment for individual loans considering the specific facts and circumstances of the borrower  guarantors  collateral  legal matters  market matters  and other circumstances that may affect the borrower s ability to repay their loan  doral s ability to repossess and liquidate the collateral  and doral s ability to pursue and enforce any deficiency amount to be collected 
the probability of a loan migrating to foreclosure whether a current loan or a past due loan  and the amount of loss given such foreclosure  is based upon the company s own experience  with more recent experience weighted more heavily in the calculated factors 
with this practice management believes the factors used better represent existing economic conditions 
in estimating the amount of loss given foreclosure factor  management considers the actual price at which recent sales have been executed compared to the unpaid principal balance at the time of foreclosure 
management differentiates the foreclosure factor based upon the loans loan to value ratio calculated as current loan balance divided by the original or most recent appraisal value  duration in other real estate owned and size of original loan 
in accordance with current accounting guidance  loans determined to be tdrs are considered to be impaired for purposes of estimating the alll and when being evaluated for impairment 
the company pools residential mortgage loans and small cre loans with similar characteristics  and performs an impairment analysis of discounted cash flows 
commercial loans including commercial real estate  commercial and industrial and construction and land that have been loss mitigated are evaluated individually for impairment 
doral measures impaired loans at their estimated realizable values determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at 
table of contents 
index to financial statements the loan s effective interest rate  or as a practical expedient  at the estimated fair value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
for collateral dependent construction projects  doral determines the fair value measurement dependent upon its exit strategy of the particular asset s acquired in foreclosure 
the cash flow forecast of the tdr loans is based upon estimates as to the rate at which reduced interest rate loans will make the reset payments or be re modified  or be foreclosed upon  the cumulative default rate of tdr loans  the prepayment speed voluntary and involuntary of the loans  the likelihood a defaulted loan will be foreclosed upon  collateral sale prices in future periods  the broader economic performance  the continued behavior of doral and the markets in a manner similar to past behavior  and other less significant matters 
if a loan or pool yields a present value or the estimated fair value of the collateral  when the loan is collateral dependent below the recorded investment  an impairment is recognized by a charge to the provision for loan and lease losses and a credit to the allowance for loan and lease losses 
actual future cash flows may deviate significantly from those estimated at this time and additional provisions may be required in the future to reflect deviations from the estimated cash flows 
in the determination of the company s alll  the discounted cash flow analysis of the pools of small balance homogenous consumer and commercial tdrs is updated to reflect historical performance of the pool 
assumptions of probability of default and loss given default are updated  giving consideration to the performance of the tdr portfolio 
for large commercial loans that are evaluated individually for impairment  the performance of the loan is also considered in order to estimate the realizable value of the loans as part of the evaluation of the alll 
doral charges loans off when it is determined that the likelihood of collecting the amount is reduced to a level that the continuation of their recognition as an asset is not warranted 
for residential mortgage loans  the reported loan investment is reduced by a charge to the alll  to an updated appraised amount less estimated costs to sell the property when the loan is days past due 
for consumer loans  the reported loan balance is reduced by a charge to the alll when the loan is days past due  except for revolving lines of credit typically credit cards which are charged off to the estimated value of the collateral if any at days 
for all commercial loans the determination of whether a loan should be fully or partially charged off is much more subjective  and considers the results of an operating business  the value of the collateral  the financial strength of the guarantors  the likelihood of different outcomes of pending litigation affecting the borrower  the potential effect of new laws or regulations  and other matters 
doral s commercial loan charge offs are determined by the charge off committee  which is a subcommittee of the allowance committee 
for large commercial loans including commercial real estate  commercial and industrial  construction and land loan portfolios  the company uses workout agents  collection specialists  attorneys and third party service providers to supplement the management of the portfolio  including the credit quality and loss mitigation alternatives 
in the case of residential construction projects  the workout function is executed by a third party servicer  under the direction of doral management  that monitors the end to end process including  but not limited to  completion of construction  necessary restructuring  pricing  marketing and unit sales 
for large commercial and construction loans the initial risk rating is driven by performance and delinquency 
on an ongoing basis  the risk rating of large credits is managed by the portfolio management and collections function and reviewed and validated by the loan review function 
while management s assessment of the inherent credit risk in the commercial portfolio continues to be high  the company will continue to evaluate on a quarterly basis of all commercial loans over days past due and between  and  so that in any one year period it would have individually evaluated for impairment of all substandard commercial loans between  and  the bank has increased its oversight of commercial loans larger than  such that all are evaluated for individual impairment each quarter  and all such criticized loans are reviewed by the bank s special assets committee each quarter 
an allowance reserve is established for individually impaired loans 
the impairment loss measurement  if any  on each individual loan identified as impaired is generally measured based on the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
as a practical expedient  impairment may be measured based on the loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
if foreclosure is probable  the company is required to measure impairment based on the fair value of the collateral 
the fair value of the collateral is generally obtained from appraisals or is based on management s estimates of future cash flows discounted at the contractual interest rate  or for loans probable of foreclosure  
table of contents 
index to financial statements discounted at a rate reflecting the principal market participant cost of funding  required rate of return and risks associated with the cash flows forecast 
in the event that appraisals show a deficiency  the company includes the deficiency in its loss reserve estimate 
although accounting guidance for loan impairment excludes large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment eg  mortgage loans  it specifically requires that loan modifications considered to be tdrs be analyzed for impairment in the same manner described above 
the company applies the following methodologies to estimate its alll for the various loan portfolios residential mortgage loans the general component of the alll for residential mortgage loans is calculated based on the probability that loans within different delinquency buckets will default probability of default and  in the case of default  the extent of losses that the company would realize loss given default 
in determining the probability of default  the company considers the historical migration of loans to default status 
in determining the allowance for loan and lease losses for residential mortgage loans  for purposes of forecasting the future behavior of the portfolio  the company utilizes a migration analysis which places a heavier weighting on the most recent experience 
severity of loss is calculated based on historical gross realized losses pursuant to oreo sales 
historical losses are adjusted upwards in cases where a lack of observations produces distortions such as apparent net gains on sale of oreo in smaller segments 
where the loan impairment analysis requires life of loan cash flow estimates in determining impairment  long term housing values are modesty adjusted upward 
severity assumptions for the residential portfolio range between and depending on the size of the loan and loan to value ratios  and up to for second mortgages 
the severity of loss on defaulted loans is adjusted to reflect the likelihood that a defaulted loan will be foreclosed upon  as a significant number of residential mortgage loans that default in puerto rico will subsequently cure by pay off  becoming current or performing as a modified loan 
for all loans whose terms have been modified and are considered troubled debt restructured loans  the loans are pooled and cash flows are forecasted including estimated future defaults  and the cash flows are discounted back to a present value using the average pool original yield 
the company s policy is to charge off all amounts in excess of the collateral value when the residential mortgage loan principal or interest is days or more past due 
construction  commercial real estate  commercial and industrial and land loans the general component of the alll for performing construction  commercial real estate  commercial and industrial and land loans is estimated considering either the probability of the loan defaulting in the next twelve months probability of default and the estimated loss incurred in the event of default loss given default or the loan quality assigned to each loan and the estimated expected loss associated with that loan grade 
the probability of default is based upon the company s experience in its current portfolio 
the loss given default is based upon the company s actual experience in resolving defaulted loans 
the company evaluates impaired loans and estimates the specific component of the alll using discounted cash flows of the loan  or fair value of the collateral  as appropriate  based on current accounting guidance 
if foreclosure is probable  current accounting guidance requires that the company use the fair value of the collateral 
commercial and construction loans over  million that are classified more than days past due  or when management is concerned about the collection of all contractual amounts due  are evaluated individually for impairment 
loans are considered impaired when  based on current information and events it is probable that the borrower will not be able to fulfill his obligation according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
consumer loans the alll for consumer loans is estimated based upon the historical charge off rate using the company s historical experience 
the company s policy is to charge off consumer loans in excess of the collateral value when the loan principal or interest is days or more past due 

table of contents 
index to financial statements loans classified as tdrs the company also engages in the restructuring and or modification of the loans which are delinquent due to economic or legal reasons  if the company determines that it is in the best interest for both the company and the borrower to do so 
in some cases  due to the nature of the borrower s financial condition  the restructure or loan modification fits the definition of troubled debt restructuring 
in accordance with accounting guidance  loans determined to be tdrs are impaired and therefore are evaluated individually or  in the case of residential mortgage in pools with similar characteristics for purposes of estimating the alll 
for residential mortgage loans determined to be tdrs  the company pools tdrs with similar characteristics and performs an impairment analysis using discounted cash flows 
if a pool yields a present value below the recorded investment in the same pool of loans  the impairment is recognized by a charge to the provision for loan and lease losses and a credit to the allowance for loan and lease losses 
for loss mitigated loans without a concession in the interest rate  the company performs an impairment analysis using discounted cash flows considering the probability of default and loss given foreclosure  and records the impairment by charging the provision for loan and lease losses with a corresponding credit to the alll 
generally  the percentage of the allowance for loan and lease losses to non performing loans will fluctuate due to the nature of the company s loan portfolios  which are primarily collateralized by real estate 
the collateral for each non performing mortgage loan is analyzed to determine potential loss exposure  and  in conjunction with other factors  this loss exposure contributes to the overall assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
appraisals and other valuations doral obtains updated valuations at the time loans default  and periodically thereafter  that are used in estimating losses and determining charge offs 
during  the company made a concerted effort to obtain updated valuations and  as a result  was able to eliminate use of the index previously utilized to estimate declines in puerto rico commercial real estate development and land values 
the new valuations account for approximately million of the provision for loan and lease losses 
fair value fair value measurements the company uses fair value measurements to state certain assets and liabilities at fair value and to support fair value disclosures 
securities held for trading  securities available for sale  derivatives and servicing assets are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
additionally  from time to time  the company may be required to record other financial assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis  such as loans held for sale  loans receivable and certain other assets 
these nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve application of lower of cost or market accounting or write downs of individual assets 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date also referred to as an exit price 
the company discloses for interim and annual reporting periods the fair value of all financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value  whether recognized or not in the company s consolidated statement of financial condition 
fair value hierarchy the fair value accounting guidance provides a three level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments 
this hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable 
fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned to a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
the company categorizes its financial instruments based on the priority of inputs to the valuation technique  into the three level hierarchy described below level valuation is based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets 

table of contents 
index to financial statements level valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market  or are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data  by correlation or by other means 
level valuation is generated from model based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market 
these unobservable assumptions reflect the company s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
valuation techniques include use of option pricing models  discounted cash flow models and similar techniques 
significant judgment may be required to determine whether certain financial instruments measured at fair value are included in level or level in making this determination  the company considers all available information that market participants use to measure the fair value of the financial instrument  including observable market data  indications of market liquidity and orderliness  and the company s understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used 
based on the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category  judgments are made regarding the significance of the level inputs to the instrument s fair value measurement in its entirety 
if level inputs are considered significant  the instrument is classified as level the process for determining fair value using unobservable inputs is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgments and assumptions 
determination of fair value it is the company s intent to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements  in accordance with the fair value hierarchy 
the degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted prices in active markets or observable market parameters 
when quoted prices and observable data in active markets are not fully available  management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value 
changes in market conditions  such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities  may reduce the availability and reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine fair value 
if quoted prices in active markets are not available  fair value measurement is based upon models that use primarily market based or independently sourced market parameters  including interest rate yield curves and prepayment speeds 
however  in certain cases  when market observable inputs for model based valuation techniques are not readily available  the company is required to make an estimate based primarily on unobservable inputs  including judgments about assumptions that market participants would use to estimate the fair value 
the company s financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis represent approximately of the company s total reported assets of billion as of december   compared with of the company s total reported assets of billion as of december  financial assets for which the fair value was determined using significant level inputs represented approximately and of these financial instruments as of december  and december   respectively

fair value option under the fair value accounting guidance  the company has the irrevocable option to elect  on a contract by contract basis  to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at the fair value of the contract and thereafter  with changes in fair value recorded in current earnings 
the company did not make any fair value option elections as of and for the years ended december  and key controls over fair value measurement the company uses independent pricing services and brokers collectively  pricing vendors to obtain fair values vendor prices which are used to either record the price of an instrument or to corroborate internally developed prices

index to financial statements the company has a governance framework and a number of key controls that are intended to ensure that our fair value measurements are appropriate and reliable 
the company s governance framework provides for independent oversight and segregation of duties 
the company s control process includes review and approval of new transaction types  price verification  and review of valuation judgments  methods  models  process controls and results 
valuation of trading securities and derivatives the company uses derivatives to manage its exposure to interest rate risk 
derivatives used as economic hedges  are included in trading securities  either because they did not qualify for  or were not designated as  an accounting hedge 
trading securities include derivatives that are used as economic hedges of mortgage servicing rights and pipeline of loans held for sale lhfs 
in addition  trading assets also include interest only strips which are instruments that can be contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in a way that the holder would not recover substantially all of its recorded investment 
the company s net gain loss on trading activities includes gains and losses  whether realized or unrealized  on securities accounted for as held for trading  including ios  as well as various other derivative financial instruments  such as forward contracts or to be announced securities tbas  that the company uses to manage its interest rate risk 
securities held for trading and derivatives are carried at fair values with realized and unrealized gains and losses reflected in non interest income  within net gain loss on trading activities 
the fair values of the company s trading securities other than ios are generally based on market prices obtained from market data sources 
for instruments not traded on a recognized market  such as mortgage backed securities  the company generally determines fair value by reference to quoted market prices for similar instruments 
the fair values of derivative instruments are obtained using internal valuation models based on financial modeling tools and using market derived assumptions obtained from market data sources 
all derivatives are recorded on the consolidated statement of condition at fair value taking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow the company to settle positive and negative positions and offset cash collateral held with the same counterparty on a net basis 
derivatives in a net asset position are reported as part of securities held for trading  while derivatives in a net liability position are reported as part of accrued expenses and other liabilities 
mortgage servicing rights and retained interests gain or loss on mortgage loan sales the company generally sells or securitizes a portion of the residential mortgage loans that it originates 
federal housing administration and veterans administration guaranteed loans are generally securitized into government national mortgage association mortgage backed securities and are classified as loans held for sale 
after holding these securities for a period of time  usually less than one month  the company sells these securities for cash through broker dealers 
conforming conventional loans are generally sold directly to fnma  fhlmc or institutional investors or exchanged for fnma or fhlmc issued mortgage backed securities  which the company also sells for cash through broker dealers 
as part of its mortgage loan sale and securitization activities  the company generally retains the right to service the mortgage loans it sells 
the company determines the gain on sale of a mortgage backed security or loan pool by subtracting the carrying value  also known as basis  of the underlying mortgage loans and any costs to sell the loans from the proceeds received from the sale 
the proceeds include cash and other assets received in the transaction primarily msrs less any liabilities incurred ie  representations and warranty provisions 
the amount of gain on sale is therefore influenced by the value of the msrs recorded at the time of sale 
if the company maintains effective control over the transferred assets  in a transfer of financial assets in exchange for cash or other consideration other than beneficial interests in transferred assets  the company accounts for the transfer as a secured borrowing loan payable with a pledge of collateral  rather than a sale 

table of contents 
index to financial statements retained interests the company routinely originates  securitizes and sells mortgage loans into the secondary market 
the company generally retains the mortgage servicing rights and  in the past  also retained interest only strips 
the company s interests that continue to be held retained interests are subject to prepayment and interest rate risk 
mortgage servicing rights msrs are assets that represent the right to service mortgage loans for others 
the company recognizes msrs when it retains servicing rights in connection with the sale or securitization of loans 
the company initially measures and subsequently carries its msrs at fair value 
msrs entitle the company to a future stream of cash flows based on the outstanding principal balance of the loans serviced and the contractual servicing fee and represent the estimated present value of the normal servicing fees net of related servicing costs expected to be received on a loan being serviced over the expected term of the loan 
the annual servicing fees generally range between and basis points  less  in certain cases  any corresponding guarantee fee 
in addition  msrs may entitle the company  depending on the contract language  to ancillary income including late charges  float income  and prepayment penalties net of the appropriate expenses incurred for performing the servicing functions 
in certain instances  the company also services loans with no contractual servicing fee 
the servicing asset or liability associated with such loans is evaluated based on ancillary income  including float  late fees  prepayment penalties and costs 
msrs are classified as servicing assets in the company s consolidated statements of financial condition 
any servicing liability recognized is included as part of accrued expenses and other liabilities in the company s consolidated statements of financial condition 
changes in fair value of msrs are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations within net gain on loans securitized and sold and capitalization of mortgage servicing 
changes in the fair value of residential msrs from period to period result from changes in the valuation model inputs or assumptions principally reflecting changes in discount rates and prepayment speed assumptions  mostly due to changes in interest rates and costs to service  including delinquency and foreclosure costs  and other changes  representing changes due to collection realization of expected cash flows over time 
the company determines the fair value of msrs using a valuation model which calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income 
the assumptions supporting the valuation of the company s msrs include estimates of discount rates  prepayment rates  servicing costs including delinquency and foreclosure costs  float and escrow account earnings  contractual servicing fee income  and ancillary income including late charges  float income and prepayment penalties  net of the expenses incurred for performing the servicing functions 
the company compares the results of its internal model to the results of a third party simple model software  to assess reasonability of the internal model results 
the prepayment rate is the annual rate at which borrowers are forecasted to repay their mortgage loan principal 
the discount rate used to determine the present value of the future net servicing income is the required rate of return investors in the market would expect for an asset with similar risk 
to determine the discount rate  the company considers the risk premium for uncertainties from servicing operations eg  possible changes in future servicing costs  ancillary income  and earnings on escrow accounts and an adjustment for liquidity 
changes to the unpaid principal balance are driven by loan sold capitalization  amortization payoffs  and repurchases of delinquent loans 
these assumptions  which are reviewed by senior management on a quarterly basis  can  and generally will  change from quarter to quarter as market conditions and projected interest rates change 
for the year ended december   the fair value of the msrs totaled to million  which reflects a decline of million when compared to december  the decline in the msr is the result of a capitalization of servicing assets of million offset by a decrease in fair value of million 
the fair value measurements of the msrs use significant unobservable inputs and  accordingly  are classified as level these assumptions are subjective in nature and changes in these assumptions could materially affect the company s operating results 
this impact does not reflect any economic hedging strategies that may be undertaken to mitigate such risk 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the company manages potential changes in the fair value of msrs through a comprehensive risk management program 
the intent is to mitigate the effects of changes in the fair value of msrs through the use of risk management instruments 
to reduce the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate and market value fluctuations  securities as well as certain derivatives such as options and interest rate swaps may be used as economic hedges of the msrs  but are not designated as accounting hedges 
these economic hedging instruments are generally carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized within net gain loss on trading activities  whereas the changes in fair value of the msr are recognized within net gain on loans securitized and sold and capitalization of mortgage servicing  in the consolidated statements of operations 
interest only strips the company originated residential mortgage loans which were subsequently securitized and sold in the secondary market in the form of mortgage backed securities and structured these transactions to create interest only strips 
ios entitle the company to a future stream of cash flows based on the difference between the weighted average coupon wac of the loans sold and the pass through interest rate payable to the investors plus a contractual servicing fee 
ios are classified as securities held for trading in the company s consolidated statements of financial condition 
the company initially measured and subsequently carries its ios at fair value 
specifically  ios are estimated as the present value of cash flows retained by the company that are generated by the underlying fixed rate mortgages as adjusted for prepayments after subtracting i the interest rate payable to the investor adjusted for any embedded cap  if applicable  and ii a contractual servicing fee 
to determine the fair value of its portfolio of variable ios  the company uses an internal valuation model that incorporates the following assumptions discount rate using month libor  unpaid principal balance upb  constant prepayment rate cpr  and the implied forward rate curve 
the io fair value is estimated based on the projected future cash flows for loans where the company retained the interest earnings cash flow 
the characteristics of the variable ios result in an increase in cash flows when libor rates fall and a reduction in cash flows when libor rates rise 
this provides a mitigating effect on the impact of prepayment speeds on the cash flows  with prepayments expected to rise when long term interest rates fall  reducing the amount of expected cash flows  and the opposite when long term interest rates rise 
the fair value measurements of the ios use significant unobservable inputs and  accordingly  are classified as level through the life of the io  the company recognizes as interest income the excess of all estimated cash flows attributable to these ios over their recorded balance using the effective yield method 
the company updates its estimates of expected cash flows quarterly and recognizes changes in calculated effective yield on a prospective basis 
as of december   the carrying value of the ios of million is related to the million of outstanding principal balance in mortgage loans sold to investors 
mortgage loan repurchase losses and repurchase liabilities estimated recourse obligation and repurchase liability the company sells mortgage loans to various parties  including government sponsored entities gses  which include the mortgage loans in gse guaranteed mortgage securitizations  special purpose entities that issue private label mortgage backed securities mbs  and other financial institutions that purchase mortgage loans for investment or private label securitization 
in addition  the company pools fha insured and va guaranteed mortgage loans  which back securities guaranteed by gnma 
the agreements under which the company sells mortgage loans and the insurance or guaranty agreements with fha and va contain provisions that include various representations and warranties regarding origination and characteristics of the mortgage loans 
although the specific representations and warranties vary among different sales  insurance  or guarantee agreements  they typically cover ownership of the loan  compliance with loan criteria set forth in the applicable agreement  validity of the lien securing the loan  absence of delinquent taxes or liens against the property securing the loan  compliance with applicable origination laws  and other matters 
in the past  the company sold mortgage loans and mbs subject to recourse provisions 
pursuant to these recourse arrangements  the company agreed to retain or share the credit risk with the purchaser of such mortgage loans for a specified period of time or up to a certain percentage of the total amount in loans sold 
the company 
table of contents 
index to financial statements estimates the fair value of the retained recourse obligation or any liability incurred at the time of sale and includes such obligation with the net proceeds from the sale  resulting in a lower gain on sale recognition 
doral estimates the fair value of its recourse obligation based on historical losses from foreclosure and disposition of mortgage loans adjusted for the expectation of changes in portfolio behavior and market environment 
in connection with the company s sales of mortgage loans  the company entered into agreements containing varying representations and warranties about  among other things  the ownership of the loan  the validity of the lien securing the loan  the loan s compliance with any applicable loan criteria established by the purchaser  including underwriting guidelines and the ongoing existence of mortgage insurance  and the loan s compliance with applicable federal  state  and local laws 
the company may be required to repurchase the mortgage loan  indemnify the securitization trust  investor or insurer  or reimburse the securitization trust  investor  or insurer for credit losses incurred on the loan in the event of a material breach of contractual representations or warranties that is not remedied within a specified period of time usually days after the company receives notice of the breach 
during  the company made significant refinements to its process for estimating its representation and warranty reserve  due primarily to increased counterparty activity and its ability to extend the timeframe  in most instances  over which it estimates the repurchase liability for mortgage loans sold by the company to gses and those mortgage loans placed into insured securitizations for the full life of the mortgage loans 
the company has established representation and warranty reserves for losses that it considers to be both probable and reasonably estimable associated with mortgage loans sold by each subsidiary  including both litigation and non litigation liabilities 
the reserve setting process relies heavily on estimates  which are inherently uncertain  and requires the application of judgment 
in establishing the representation and warranty reserves  the company considers a variety of factors  depending on the category of purchaser  and relies on historical data 
the company evaluates these estimates on a quarterly basis 
the methodology used to estimate the liability for obligations under representations and warranties related to transfers of residential mortgage loans is a function of the representations and warranties given and considers a variety of factors 
depending on the counterparty  these factors include actual defaults  estimated future defaults  historical loss experience  estimated home prices  other economic conditions  estimated probability that the company will receive a repurchase request  including consideration of whether presentation thresholds will be met  number of payments made by the borrower prior to default  estimated probability that the company will be required to repurchase a loan and the experience with and behavior of the counterparty 
it also considers bulk settlements  as appropriate 
the estimate of the liability for obligations under representations and warranties is based upon currently available information  significant judgment  and a number of factors  including those set forth above  that are subject to change 
changes to any one of these factors could significantly impact the estimate of the company s liability 
the provision for representations and warranties may vary significantly each period as the methodology used to estimate the expense continues to be refined based on the level and type of repurchase requests presented  defects identified  the latest experience gained on repurchase requests and other relevant facts and circumstances 
the estimated range of possible loss related to representations and warranties is thousand to million  for which the company has established a liability of million in the consolidated financial statements 
the mortgage loan repurchase liability at december  represents the company s best estimate of the probable loss that it may incur for various representations and warranties in the contractual provisions of its sales of mortgage loans 
because the level of mortgage loan repurchase losses are dependent on economic factors  investor demand strategies and other external conditions that may change over the life of the underlying loans  the level of the liability for mortgage loan repurchase losses is difficult to estimate and requires considerable management judgement 
the company manages the risk associated with potential repurchases or other forms of settlement through its underwriting and quality assurance practices  and by servicing mortgage loans to meet investor and secondary market standards 
litigation reserve in accordance with applicable accounting guidance  the company establishes an accrued liability for litigation and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable 
in such cases  there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued 
when a 
table of contents 
index to financial statements loss is not both probable and reasonably estimable  the company does not establish an accrued liability 
as a litigation matter develops  the company  in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter  evaluates  on an ongoing basis  whether such matter presents a loss contingency that is both probable and reasonably estimable 
if  at the time of evaluation  the loss contingency related to a litigation or regulatory matter is not both probable and reasonably estimable  the matter will continue to be monitored for further developments that would make such loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable 
once the loss contingency related to a legal or regulatory matter is deemed to be both probable and reasonably estimable  the company will establish an accrued liability with respect to such loss contingency and record a corresponding amount of litigation related expense 
the company will continue to monitor the matter and adjust the reserve for further developments which could affect the amount of the accrued liability previously established 
for a limited number of the matters disclosed in note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible in future periods  whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability  the company is able to estimate a range of possible losses 
in determining whether it is possible to provide an estimate of loss or range of possible losses  the company reviews and evaluates its material litigation and regulatory matters on an ongoing basis  in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter  in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments 
these may include information learned through the discovery process  rulings on dispositive motions  settlement discussions  and other rulings by courts  arbitrators or others 
in cases in which the company possesses sufficient information to develop an estimate of loss or range of possible losses  that estimate is aggregated and disclosed in note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
for other disclosed matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible  such an estimate is not possible 
those matters for which an estimate is not possible are not included within this estimated range 
therefore  the estimated range of possible losses represents what the company believes to be an estimate of possible losses only for certain matters meeting these criteria 
it does not represent the company s maximum loss exposure 
information is provided in note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements regarding the nature of and  where specified  the amount of the claim associated with these loss contingencies 
income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities based on current tax laws 
to the extent tax laws change  deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted  as necessary  in the period that the tax change is enacted 
the company recognizes income tax benefits when the realization of such benefits is probable 
a valuation allowance is recognized for any deferred tax asset which  based on management s evaluation  it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and  in particular  any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  the company considers the expected reversal of its deferred tax assets and liabilities  projected future taxable income  cumulative losses in recent years and tax planning strategies 
the determination of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets requires judgment based on the weight of all available evidence considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
these estimates are projected through the life of the related deferred tax assets based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and consistent with current operating results 
changes in future operating results not currently forecasted may have a significant impact on the realization of deferred tax assets 
the company classifies all interest and penalties related to tax uncertainties as income tax expense 
income tax benefit or expense includes i deferred tax expense or benefit  which represents the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability balance during the year plus any change in the valuation allowance  if any  ii current tax expense  and iii interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions

doral financial s net interest income is subject to interest rate risk due to the repricing and maturity mismatch in the company s assets and liabilities 
generally  doral financial s residential mortgage assets have a longer maturity and a later repricing date than its liabilities  though its growing us based commercial loan portfolio is dominated by variable rate assets 
the net effect is that doral will experience lower net interest income in periods of rising short term interest rates and higher net interest income in periods of declining short term interest rates

index to financial statements compared to non interest expense decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period 
this decrease was the result of the company s cost reduction efforts during as well as improvements resulting from transactions made in  as follows oreo expenses totaled million in compared to million for the same period in  a decrease of million 
higher oreo expenses in were mainly related to an additional provision for oreo losses of million established during to recognize the effect of management s strategic decision to reduce pricing to stimulate property sales  market value adjustments driven by lower values of certain oreo properties  and higher maintenance costs to maintain the properties in saleable condition 
the favorable decrease is also due to better pricing on the sales of oreo  resulting in lower losses during a decrease of million in professional services was driven by lower defense litigation costs of million  lower advisory services of million related to the dissolution of doral holdings and doral holdings lp  and lower advisory services of million in compared to which were incurred during in relation to the sale of certain construction loans as well as expenses incurred for the company s participation in bidding for fdic assisted transactions 
a decrease of million in the provision loss for the company s claim receivable on lbi that was established in the claim was subsequently sold to a third party during the fourth quarter of lower fdic insurance expense of million related to a lower deposit base and a change in the method of computing the assessment as prescribed by the regulator 
lower advertising expense of million as the company incurred higher expenses in due to the campaigns to gain market share in deposits and mortgage originations subsequent to the local market bank failures and asset acquisitions in april of income taxes the puerto rico income tax law does not generally provide for the filing of a consolidated tax return  therefore  income tax expense on the company s consolidated statement of income is the aggregate income tax expense of doral s individual subsidiaries 
doral money  inc  a us corporation  and the us operations of doral bank  are subject to us income tax on their income derived from all sources 
substantially all other of the company s operations are conducted through subsidiaries in puerto rico 
income tax benefit for was million compared to an income tax expense of million in the year the improvement in income tax of million is due mainly from the million benefit recorded when doral financial corporation and its puerto rico domiciled subsidiaries entered into a closing agreement with the commonwealth of puerto rico related to past income tax overpayments  which allowed doral to convert certain deferred tax assets into a prepaid tax 
in addition  a million deferred tax benefit was recorded during the fourth quarter of that resulted from the release of a portion of the deferred tax assets valuation allowance at doral financial corporation  based on our evaluation of all available evidence in determining whether the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets at doral financial corporation was needed 
our evaluation considered that i doral financial corporation is in a three year cumulative loss position  but its core business has shown stable results in recent quarters  ii the conversion of doral insurance to a limited liability corporation and its election to be treated as a partnership which will allow doral insurance to consolidate its income and expenses into doral financial corporation going forward as clarified by a tax ruling with the puerto rico treasury department and  iii doral financial corporation transferred effective january   certain non performing assets to a newly formed puerto rico corporate subsidiary for regulatory and business purposes  which will reduce doral financial corporation stand alone volatility in earnings 
based on our evaluation of both positive and negative evidence  we concluded that the objective positive evidence related to the i doral insurance profitable business to be considered as part of doral financial corporation results going forward and  ii the reduction of credit losses and volatility to doral financial corporation stand alone results from the transfer of non performing assets to another entity outweighed the negative evidence and that it is more likely than not that a portion of doral financial corporation deferred tax assets will be realized

index to financial statements also  the income tax expense decreased as a result of doral money lending activities using us based funding sources  therefore eliminating the withholding tax on debt payments from the us based lending operations to the puerto rico based funding operations 
income tax expense also includes branch level interest tax of million as a result of doral bank operating a us branch after the merger of doral bank  fsb with doral bank 
however  this represents a tax savings when compared to the past withholding tax on the debt payments from doral money to doral bank 
doral bank may also be subject to branch profits tax in future tax years  but there was no branch profits tax in the current year as there was an increase in us net equity for the period 
as of december  and  the company had two puerto rico entities which were in a cumulative loss position 
for purposes of assessing the realization of the dtas  the cumulative taxable loss position for these two entities is considered to be significant negative evidence that has caused management to conclude that the company will not be able to fully realize the deferred tax assets related to these two entities in the future 
accordingly  as of december  and  the company determined that it was more likely than not that million and million  respectively  of its gross deferred tax asset would not be realized and therefore maintained a valuation allowance for those amounts 
for puerto rico taxable entities with positive core earnings  a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets was not recorded in and since they are expected to continue to be profitable 
at december  and  the net deferred tax asset associated with these two companies was million and million  respectively 
it is management s opinion that  for these companies  the positive evidence of profitable core earnings outweighs any negative evidence 
in and management did not establish a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets generated on the unrealized losses of its securities available for sale because the company does not intend to sell the securities before recovery of value  and based on available evidence it is not more likely than not that the company will decide or be required to sell the securities before the recovery of its amortized cost basis 
management has therefore determined that a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets generated on the unrealized losses of its securities available for sale is not necessary at this time 
there is no valuation allowance related to the cash flow hedges as of december  management assesses the realization of its deferred tax assets at each reporting period 
to the extent that earnings improve and the deferred tax assets become realizable  the company may be able to reduce the valuation allowance through earnings

doral financial s future results could be adversely affected by a significant increase in mortgage interest rates that may continue to reduce the refinancing activity 
however  the company believes that refinancing activity in puerto rico is less sensitive to interest rate changes than in the mainland united states because a significant number of refinance loans in the puerto rico mortgage market are made for debt consolidation purposes rather than interest savings due to lower rates 
loan origination channels in puerto rico  doral financial relies primarily on doral bank s extensive branch network to originate loans 
it supplements these originations with wholesale purchases from other financial institutions

the company does not expect significant losses related to these delinquencies since it has established a reserve for loans under recourse agreements and for other non recourse loans and it has not experienced significant losses in the past 
as part of its servicing responsibilities  in some servicing agreements  doral financial is required to advance the scheduled payments of principal or interest whether or not collected from the underlying borrower 
while doral financial generally recovers funds advanced pursuant to these arrangements within days  it must absorb the cost of funding the advances during the time the advance is outstanding 
in the past  doral financial sold pools of delinquent fha and va and conventional mortgage loans 
under these arrangements  doral financial is required to advance the scheduled payments whether or not collected from the underlying borrower 
while doral financial expects to recover a significant portion of the amounts advanced through foreclosure or  in the case of fha and va loans  under the applicable fha and va insurance and guarantee programs  the amounts advanced tend to be greater than normal arrangements because of the large number of delinquent loans

gnma programs allow financial institutions to buy back individual delinquent mortgage loans that meet certain criteria from the securitized loan pool for which the company provides servicing 
at the company s option and without gnma prior authorization  doral financial may repurchase such delinquent loans for an amount equal to of the loan s remaining principal balance 
this buy back option is considered a conditional option until the delinquency criteria are met  at which time the option becomes unconditional but not an obligation 
when the loans backing a gnma security are initially securitized  the company treats the transaction as a sale for accounting purposes and the loans are removed from the balance sheet because the conditional nature of the buy back option means that the company does not maintain effective control over the loans 
when individual loans later meet gnma s specified delinquency criteria and are eligible for repurchase  doral financial is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans 
in such case  for financial reporting purposes  the delinquent gnma loans are brought back into the company s portfolio of loans held for sale  regardless of whether the company intends to exercise the buy back option

the average life of these loans is substantially less than their contractual terms because of prepayments and  with respect to conventional mortgage loans  due on sale clauses  which give doral financial the right to declare a conventional mortgage loan immediately due and payable in the event  among other things  that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the average life of mortgage loans tends to increase when current mortgage loan rates are higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and  conversely  decrease when current mortgage loan rates are lower than rates on existing mortgage loans 
under the latter circumstance  the weighted average yield on loans decreases as higher yielding loans are repaid or refinanced at lower rates

at december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of doral financial s gross loans receivable were adjustable rate loans 
the increase in the percentage of adjustable rate loans from to was due to the growth in the commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios 
the adjustable rate construction and land and commercial loans have interest rate adjustment limitations and are generally tied to the prime rate  and often provide for a maximum and minimum rate beyond which the applicable interest rate will not fluctuate

these actions are part of the execution of the company strategy to de lever and reposition the balance sheet

a detailed cash flow analysis of certain securities in unrealized loss positions was performed by the company during to assess whether they were otti 
the company used a third party provider to generate cash flow forecasts of each security reviewed based on a combination of management and market driven assumptions and securitization terms  including remaining payment terms of the security  prepayment speeds  the estimated amount of loans to become seriously delinquent over the life of the security  the estimated life time severity rate  estimated losses over the life of the security  loan characteristics  the level of subordination within the security structure  expected housing price changes and interest rate assumptions

the remainder of the company s securities portfolio that have experienced decreases in the fair value  the decline is considered to be temporary as the company expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis on the securities and neither intends to sell these securities nor is it more likely than not that it will be required to sell these securities 
therefore  the difference between the amortized cost basis and the market value of the securities is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income

these three securities had an amortized cost of million as of december  that includes otti of million 
once an otti credit loss is recognized  the investment is adjusted to a new amortized cost basis equal to the previous amortized cost basis less the amount recognized in earnings 
for the investment securities for which otti was recognized in earnings  the difference between the new amortized cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected will be accreted as interest income

other uses of cash servicing agreements relating to the mbs programs of fnma  fhlmc and gnma  and to mortgage loans sold to certain other investors  require the company to advance funds to make scheduled payments of principal  interest  taxes and insurance  if such payments have not been received from the borrowers 
while the company generally recovers funds advanced pursuant to these arrangements within a reasonable time  it must absorb the cost of funding these advances during the time they are outstanding 
for the year ended december   the monthly average amount of funds advanced by the company under such servicing agreements was approximately million  compared to million for the corresponding period of to the extent the mortgage loans underlying the company s servicing portfolio experience increased delinquencies  the company would be required to dedicate additional cash resources to comply with its obligation to advance funds as well as incur additional administrative costs related to increases in collection efforts 
in the past  the company sold pools of delinquent fha and va and conventional mortgage loans 
under these arrangements  the company is required to advance the scheduled payments whether or not collected from the underlying borrower 
while the company expects to recover the amounts advanced through foreclosure or  in the case of fha va loans  under the applicable fha and va insurance and guarantee programs  the amounts advanced tend to be greater than normal arrangements because of the initial delinquent status of the loans 
as of december  and  the outstanding principal balance of such delinquent loans was million and million  respectively  and the aggregate monthly amount of funds advanced by the company was million and million  respectively 
when the company sells mortgage loans to third parties which serve as a source of cash it also generally makes customary representations and warranties regarding the characteristics of the loans sold 
to the extent the loans do not meet specified characteristics  investors are generally entitled to require the company to repurchase such loans 
in addition to its servicing and warranty obligations  in the past the company s loan sale activities have included the sale of non conforming mortgage loans subject to recourse arrangements that generally require the company to repurchase or substitute the loans if the loans are days or more past due or otherwise in default up to a specified amount or limited to a period of time after the sale 
to the extent the delinquency ratios of the loans sold subject to recourse are greater than anticipated and the company is required to repurchase more loans than anticipated  the company s liquidity requirements would increase 
refer to off balance sheet activities below for additional information on these arrangements 
in the past  doral financial sold or securitized mortgage loans with fnma on a partial or full recourse basis 
the company s contractual agreements with fnma authorize fnma to require doral financial to post collateral in the form of cash or marketable securities to secure such recourse obligation to the extent the company does not maintain an investment grade rating 
as of december   the company s maximum recourse exposure with fnma totaled million and required the posting of a minimum of million in collateral to secure recourse obligations 
while considered unlikely by the company  fnma has the contractual right to request collateral for the full amount of the company s recourse obligations 
any such request by fnma would have a materially adverse effect on the company s liquidity and business 
refer to note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and off balance sheet activities below for additional information on these arrangements 
under the company s repurchase lines of credit and derivative contracts  doral financial is required to deposit cash or qualifying securities to meet margin requirements 
to the extent that the value of securities previously pledged as collateral declines because of changes in interest rates or other market conditions  the company will be required to deposit additional cash or securities to meet its margin requirements  thereby adversely affecting its liquidity

the increase in loans was driven by growth in commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans in the us this growth was partially offset by a decrease in the puerto rico loans outstanding and an increase in the alll of million 
the decrease in securities is due mostly to the sale of mortgage backed securities during the year as part of the company s strategy to reduce securities and increase loan exposure 
the cash balance grew as a result of the increase in deposits and cash flows associated with the clo transactions

these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the statement of financial condition 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the contractual amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of involvement the company has in particular classes of financial instruments 
the company s exposure to credit losses in the event of non performance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit or for forward sales is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments 
doral financial uses the same credit policies in making these commitments as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as the conditions established in the contract are met 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses 
generally  the company does not enter into interest rate lock agreements with borrowers 
the company purchases mortgage loans and simultaneously enters into a sale and securitization agreement with the same counterparty during the period between the trade and settlement date 
a letter of credit is an arrangement that represents an obligation on the part of the company to a designated third party  contingent upon the failure of the company s customer to perform under the terms of the underlying contract with the third party 
the amount of the letter of credit represents the maximum amount of credit risk in the event of non performance by these customers 
under the terms of a letter of credit  an obligation arises only when the underlying event fails to occur as intended  and the obligation is generally up to a stipulated amount and with specified terms and conditions 
letters of credit are used by the customer as a credit enhancement and typically expire without having been drawn upon 
the company evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral  if deemed necessary by the company upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty

risk management doral financial s business is subject to four broad categories of risks interest rate risk  credit risk  operational risk and liquidity risk 
doral financial has specific policies and procedures which have been designed to identify  measure and manage risks to which the company is exposed 
interest rate and market risk management interest rate risk refers to the risk that changes in interest rates may adversely affect the value of doral financial s assets and liabilities and its net interest income 
doral financial s risk management policies are designed with the goal of maximizing shareholder value with emphasis on stability of net interest income and market value of equity 
these policies are also targeted to remain well capitalized  preserve adequate liquidity  and meet various regulatory requirements 
the objectives of doral financial s risk management policies are pursued within the limits established by the board of directors of the company 
the board of directors has delegated the oversight of interest rate and liquidity risks to its risk policy committee 
doral financial s asset liability management committee has been created under the authority of the board of directors to manage the company s interest rate  market value of equity and liquidity risk 
the alco is primarily responsible for ensuring that doral financial operates within the company s established asset liability management policy guidelines and procedures 
the alco reports directly to the risk policy committee of the board of directors 
the alco is responsible for developing the company s asset liability management and liquidity strategy  establishing and monitoring of interest rate  pricing and liquidity risk limits to ensure compliance with the company s policies  overseeing product pricing and volume objectives for banking and treasury activities  and overseeing the maintenance of management information systems that supply relevant information for the alco to fulfill its responsibilities as it relates to asset liability management 
risk identification measurement and control doral financial manages interest rate exposure related to its assets and liabilities on a consolidated basis 
changes in interest rates can affect the volume of doral financial s mortgage loan originations  the net interest income earned on doral financial s portfolio of loans and securities  the amount of gain on the sale of loans and the value of doral financial s servicing assets  loans  investment securities and other retained interests 

table of contents 
index to financial statements as part of its interest rate risk management practices  doral financial has implemented measures to identify the interest rate risk associated with the company s assets  liabilities and off balance sheet activities 
the company has also developed policies and procedures to control and manage these risks and continues to improve its interest rate risk management practices 
the company currently manages its interest rate risk by principally focusing on the following metrics i net interest income sensitivity  ii market value of equity sensitivity mve  iii effective duration of equity  and iv maturity repricing gaps 
doral financial s asset liability management policies provide a limit structure based on these four metrics 
a single limit is defined for effective duration of equity 
net interest income sensitivity limits are set for instantaneous parallel rate shifts 
specific parallel rate shifts defined for net interest income and market value equity limits are bps and bps 
net interest income sensitivity limits are established for different time horizons 
additional limits are defined for maturity repricing mismatches  however management continues to emphasize risk management and controls based on net interest income and mve sensitivity as these measures incorporate the effect of existing asset liability mismatches 
the explanations below provide a brief description of the metrics used by the company and the methodologies assumptions employed in the estimation of these metrics net interest income sensitivity 
refers to the relationship between market interest rates and net interest income due to the maturity mismatches and repricing characteristics of doral financial s interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and off balance sheet positions 
to measure net interest income exposure to changes in market interest rates  the company uses earnings simulation techniques 
these simulation techniques allow for the forecasting of net interest income and expense under various rate scenarios for the measurement of interest rate risk exposures of doral financial 
primary scenarios include instantaneous parallel and non parallel rate shocks 
net interest income sensitivity is measured for time horizons ranging from twelve to sixty months and as such  serves as a measure of short to medium term earnings risk 
the basic underlying assumptions used in net interest income simulations are i the company maintains a static balance sheet  ii full reinvestment of funds in similar product instruments with similar maturity and repricing characteristics  iii spread assumed constant  iv prepayment rates on mortgages and mortgage related securities are modeled using multi factor prepayment model  v non maturity deposit decay and price elasticity assumptions are incorporated  and vi evaluation of embedded options is also taken into consideration 
to complement and broaden the analysis of earnings at risk the company also performs earning simulations for longer time horizons 
market value of equity sensitivity 
used to capture and measure the risks associated with longer term maturity and re pricing mismatches 
doral financial uses value simulation techniques for all financial components of the consolidated statement of financial condition 
valuation techniques include static cash flows analyses  stochastic models to qualify value of embedded options and prepayment modeling 
to complement and broaden the risk analysis  the company uses duration and convexity analysis to measure the sensitivity of the mve to changes in interest rates 
duration measures the linear change in mve caused by changes in interest rates  while  convexity measures the asymmetric changes in mve caused by changes in interest rates due to the presence of options 
the analysis of duration and convexity combined provide a better understanding of the sensitivity of the mve to changes in interest rates 
effective duration of equity 
the effective duration of equity is a broad measure of the impact of interest rate changes on doral financial s economic capital 
the measure summarizes the net sensitivity of assets and liabilities  adjusted for off balance sheet positions 
interest rate risk management strategy doral financial s current interest rate management strategy is implemented by the alco and is focused on reducing the volatility of the company s earnings and to protect the mve 
while the current strategy will also use a combination of derivatives and balance sheet management  more emphasis is placed on balance sheet management 
net interest income risk 
in order to protect net interest income against interest rate risk  the alco employs a number of tactics which are evaluated and adjusted in relation to prevailing market conditions 
internal balance sheet management practices are designed to reduce the re pricing gaps of the company s assets 
table of contents 
index to financial statements and liabilities 
however  the company will use derivatives  mainly interest rate swaps and interest rate caps  as part of its interest rate risk management activities 
interest rate swaps represent a mutual agreement to exchange interest rate payments  one party pays fixed rate and the other pays a floating rate 
for net interest income protection  doral financial typically enters into a fixed rate payer float receiver swaps to eliminate the variability of cash flows associated with the floating rate debt obligations 
market value of equity hedging strategies 
due to the composition of doral financial s assets and liabilities  the company has earnings exposure to rising interest rates 
the company measures the market value of all rate sensitive assets  liabilities and off balance sheet positions  and the difference between assets and liabilities  adjusted by off balance sheet positions  is termed mve 
the company measures how the mve fluctuates with different rate scenarios to measure risk exposure of economic capital or mve 
management uses duration matching strategies to manage the fluctuations of mve within the long term targets established by the board of directors of the company 
duration risk 
duration is a measure of the impact in magnitude and direction of changes on interest rates in the economic value of financial instruments 
in order to bring duration measures within the policy thresholds established by the company  management may use a combination of internal liability management techniques and derivative instruments 
derivatives such as interest rate swaps  treasury futures  eurodollar futures and forward contracts may be entered into as part of the company s risk management 
convexity risk 
convexity is a measure of how much duration changes as interest rates change 
for doral financial  convexity risk primarily results from mortgage prepayment risk 
as part of managing convexity risk management may use a combination of internal balance sheet management instruments or derivatives  such as swaptions  caps  floors  put or call options on interest rate indexes or related fixed income underlying securities ie  eurodollar  treasury notes 
hedging related to mortgage banking activities 
as part of doral financial s risk management of mortgage banking activities  such as secondary market and servicing assets  the company enters into forward agreements to buy or sell mbs to protect the company against changes in interest rates that may impact the economic value of servicing assets or the pricing of marketable loan production 
hedging the various sources of interest rate risks related to mortgage banking activities is a complex process that requires sophisticated modeling  continuous monitoring and active management 
while doral financial balances and manages the various aspects relating to mortgage activities  there are potential risks to earnings associated to them 
some of these potential risks are the valuation of msrs are recorded in earnings immediately within the accounting period in which the changes in value occur  whereas the impact of changes in interest rates are reflected in originations with a time lag and effects on servicing fee income occurs over time 
thus  even when mortgage activities could be protected from adverse changes in interest rates over a period of time on a cumulative basis they may display large variations in income from period to period 
the degree to which the natural hedge associated to mortgage banking ie  originating and servicing offsets changes in servicing asset valuations may be imperfect  as it may vary over time 
origination volumes  the valuation of servicing assets  economic hedging activities and other related costs are impacted by multiple factors  which include changes in the mix of new business  changes in the term structure of interest rates  changes in mortgage spreads mortgage basis to other rate benchmarks  and rate volatility  among others 
interrelation of all these factors is hard to predict and  as such  the ability to perfectly hedge their effects is limited 
doral financial s risk profile doral financial s goal is to manage market and interest rate risk within targeted levels established and periodically reviewed by the board of directors of the company 
interest rate sensitivity represents the relationship between market interest rates and the net interest income due to existing maturity and repricing imbalances between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity is also defined 
table of contents 
index to financial statements as the relationship between market interest rates and the economic value of equity referred to as mve 
the interest risk profile of the company is measured in the context of net interest income  market value of equity  maturity repricing gaps and effective duration of equity 
the risk profile of the company is managed by use of natural offsets generated by the different components of the balance sheet as a result of the normal course of business operations and through active hedging activities by means of both on balance sheet and off balance sheet transactions ie  derivative instruments to achieve targeted risk levels 
the company s interest rate risk exposure may be asymmetric due to the presence of embedded options in products and transactions which allow clients and counterparties to modify the maturity of loans  securities  deposits and or borrowings 
examples of embedded options include the ability of a mortgagee to prepay his her mortgage or a counterparty exercising its puttable option on a structured funding transaction 
assets and liabilities with embedded options are evaluated taking into consideration the presence of options to estimate their economic price elasticity and also the effect of options in assessing maturity repricing characteristics of the company s balance sheet 
the embedded optionality is primarily managed by purchasing or selling options or by other active risk management strategies involving the use of derivatives  including the forward sale of mbs 
the company measures interest rate risk and has specific targets for various market rate scenarios 
general assumptions for the measurement of interest income sensitivity are i rate shifts are parallel and instantaneous throughout all benchmark yield curves and rate indexes  ii behavioral assumptions are driven by simulated market rates under each scenario ie  prepayments  repricing of certain liabilities  and iii static balance sheet assumed with cash flows reinvested at forecasted market rates ie  forward curve  static spreads in similar instruments 
for net interest income  the company monitors exposures and has established limits for time horizons ranging from one up to three years  although for risk management purposes earning exposures are forecasted for longer time horizons 
the tables below present the risk profile of doral financial taking into account the derivatives set forth below under basis point parallel and instantaneous increases or dercreases in interest rates  as of december  and table v risk profile as of december  market value of equity risk net interest income risk bps bps as of december  market value of equity risk net interest income risk bps bps based on month forward change in net interest income 
the net interest income nii sensitivity measure to a basis point parallel and instantaneous rate increase  based on a month horizon  changed from to when comparing december  to the effect is mainly driven by net interest income expansion 
as of december   the mve showed higher sensitivity to rising interest rates when compared to december  mve sensitivity to an increase of basis points in market rates changed from to 
the company continues to actively manage the balance sheet mismatches to maintain the interest rate risk profile in line with targets mainly by the use of on balance sheet strategies 
overall composition of the company s balance sheet was relatively stable between reporting periods which is reflected in relatively unchanged sensitivity measures for nii and mve

as described above  doral financial uses derivatives to manage its exposure to interest rate risk caused by changes in interest rates 
derivatives are generally either privately negotiated over the counter otc contracts or standard contracts transacted through regulated exchanges 
otc contracts generally consist of swaps  caps and collars  forwards and options 
exchange traded derivatives include futures and options 
the company is subject to various interest rate cap agreements to manage its interest rate exposure 
interest rate cap agreements generally involve purchase of out of the money caps to protect the company from larger rate moves and to provide the company with positive convexity 
non performance by the counterparty exposes doral financial to interest rate risk 
the company did not have interest rate caps outstanding at december  the company is subject to various interest rate swap agreements to manage its interest rate exposure 
interest rate swap agreements generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying principal 
the company principally uses interest rate swaps to convert floating rate liabilities to fixed rate by entering into pay fixed receive floating interest rate swaps 
non performance by the counterparty exposes doral financial to interest rate risk 
at december   the company did not have any interest rate swaps outstanding 
freestanding derivatives 
doral financial uses derivatives to manage its market risk and generally accounts for such instruments on a mark to market basis with gains or losses charged to current operations as part of net gain loss on trading activities as they occur 
contracts with positive fair values are recorded as assets and contracts with negative fair values as liabilities  after the application of netting arrangements 
fair values of derivatives such as interest rate futures contracts or options are determined by reference to market prices 
fair values for derivatives purchased in the otc market are determined by valuation models and validated with prices provided by external sources 
the notional amounts of freestanding derivatives totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
notional amounts indicate the volume of derivative activity  but do not represent doral financial s exposure to market or credit risk 
derivatives hedge accounting 
doral financial seeks to designate derivatives under hedge accounting guidelines when it can clearly identify an asset or liability that can be hedged pursuant to the strict hedge accounting guidelines 
at december   the company did not have any notional amount of swaps treated under hedge accounting 
the notional amount of swaps treated under hedge accounting at december  totaled million 
the company typically uses interest rate swaps to convert floating rate advances from fhlb to fixed rate by entering into pay fixed receive floating swaps 
in these cases  the company matches all of the terms in the advance from fhlb to the floating leg of the interest rate swap 
since both transactions are symmetrically opposite the effectiveness of the hedging relationship is high

the market risk of derivatives arises principally from the potential for changes in the value of derivative contracts based on changes in interest rates 
the credit risk of otc derivatives arises from the potential of counterparties to default on their contractual obligations 
to manage this credit risk  doral financial deals with counterparties of good credit standing  enters into master netting agreements whenever possible and monitors the market on pledged collateral to minimize credit exposure 
master netting agreements incorporate rights of set off that provide for the net settlement of contracts with the same counterparty in the event of default 
as a result of the ratings downgrades affecting doral financial  counterparties to derivative contracts used for interest rate risk management purposes could increase the applicable margin requirements under such contracts  or could require the company to terminate such agreements

credit risk doral financial is subject to credit risk  particularly with respect to its investment securities and loans receivable 
for a discussion of credit risk on investment securities refer to note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
loans receivable are loans that doral financial holds for investment and  therefore  is at risk for the term of the loans 
because many of doral financial s loans collateralized by real estate are made to borrowers located in puerto rico and secured by properties located in puerto rico  the company is subject to credit risk tied to adverse economic  political or business developments and natural hazards  such as hurricanes  that may affect puerto rico 
the puerto rico economy has been in a recession since this has affected borrowers disposable incomes and their ability to make payments when due  causing an increase in delinquency and foreclosure rates 
while the rate of economic contraction has slowed down substantially  the company believes that these conditions will continue to affect the credit quality of its loans receivable portfolio 
in addition  there is evidence that property values have declined from their peak 
this decline in value has reduced borrowers capacity to refinance and increased the company s exposure to loss upon default 
the decline in property value and the increase in expected defaults are incorporated into the loss rates used for calculating the company s allowance for loan and lease losses 
in september  the governor of pr signed into law act no 
of which established various housing tax and other incentives to stimulate the sale of new and existing housing units 
the tax and other incentives  which include incentives or reductions relating to capital gains taxes  property taxes and property recording fees and stamps  will be in effect until june  and are expected to continue to have a favorable impact in the current economic environment and new home absorption in puerto rico 
there has been significantly less fade in residential real estate values in homes under  in puerto rico  the price point for the preponderance of doral s residential mortgage loan portfolio  than for higher prices homes 
with respect to mortgage loans originated for sale as part of its mortgage banking business  doral financial is generally at risk for any mortgage loan default from the time it originates the mortgage loan until the time it sells the loan or securitizes it into a mbs 
with respect to fha loans  doral financial is insured as to principal by the fha against foreclosure loss 
va loans are guaranteed within a range of to of the principal amount of the loan subject to a maximum  ranging from  to  in addition to the mortgage collateral

doral financial s residential mortgage loan portfolio does not include a significant amount of adjustable interest rate  negative amortization  or other exotic credit features that are common in other parts of the us doral has a notable portfolio of residential balloon loans and as part of its loss mitigation programs  the company has granted certain concessions to borrowers in financial difficulties that have proven payment capacity  which may include interest only periods or temporary interest rate reductions 
the payments for these loans will reset at the former payment amount unless the loan is restructured again or the restructured terms are extended 
substantially all residential mortgage loans are conventional and year amortizing fixed rate loans at origination 
the residential mortgage portfolio includes some loans that  at some point  were repurchased pursuant to recourse obligations 
repurchases of delinquent loans from recourse obligations for the year ended december  totaled million 
when repurchased from recourse obligations  loans are recorded at their market value  which considers credit quality 
loans collateralized by land in puerto rico totaled to million as of december  of the puerto rico land loans  million are reported as impaired  net of prior charge offs of million 
doral also has reserves of million as of year end allocated to the impaired land loans 
doral s charge offs and reserves are based upon the delinquency of the loan  expectation as to future recoveries  and external estimates of net realizable value 
historically  doral financial provided land acquisition  development  and construction financing to developers of residential housing projects 
construction loans extended to developers are typically adjustable rate loans  indexed to the prime interest rate with terms ranging generally from to months

loan modifications and troubled debt restructurings with puerto rico unemployment at approximately for  many borrowers have temporarily lost their means to pay their loan contractual principal and interest obligations 
as a result of the economic hardships  a number of borrowers have defaulted on their debt obligations  including residential mortgage loans 
the lower level of income and economic activity has also led to fewer new construction residential home sales  increased commercial real estate vacancy  and lower business revenues  which has led to increased defaults on commercial  commercial real estate  construction and land loans 
doral s management has concluded that it is in the company s best interest  and in the best interest of the puerto rican economy and citizenry  if certain defaulted loans are restructured in a manner that keeps borrowers in their homes  or businesses operating  rather than foreclosing on the loan collateral if it is concluded that the borrower s payment difficulties are temporary and doral will in time collect the loan principal and agreed upon interest 
doral has created a number of loan modification programs to help borrowers stay in their homes and operate their businesses which also optimizes borrower performance and returns to doral 
in some of these cases  the restructure or loan modification fits the definition of troubled debt restructuring as defined by current accounting guidance 
the modification programs are designed to provide temporary relief and  if necessary  longer term financial relief to the consumer loan customer 
doral s consumer loan loss mitigation program including consumer loan products and residential mortgage loans  grants a concession for economic or legal reasons related to the borrowers financial difficulties that doral would not otherwise consider 
doral s loss mitigation programs can provide for one or a combination of the following movement of unpaid principal and

no programs adopted by doral provide for the forgiveness of contractually due principal or interest 
deferred principal and uncollected interest are added to the end of the loan term at the time of the restructuring and uncollected interest is not recognized as income until collected when the loan is paid off 
it is doral s intention to make these programs available to those borrowers who have defaulted  or are likely to default permanently  on their loan and would lose their homes in foreclosure action absent a lender concession 
however  doral will move borrowers and properties to foreclosure if the company is not reasonably assured that the borrower will be able to repay all contractual principal or interest

doral mitigates losses from loan defaults within its commercial loan portfolios loans through its loan workout function

general business and economic conditions  puerto rico economy and fiscal condition the company s business and financial results are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in puerto rico and the united states 
significant business and economic conditions include short term and long term interest rates  inflation and the strength or weakness of the puerto rico and united states economies and housing markets 
if any of these conditions deteriorate  the company s business and financial results could be adversely affected 
for example  business and economic conditions that negatively impact household income could decrease the demand for residential mortgage loans and increase the number of customers who become delinquent or default on their loans  or  a dramatically rising interest rate environment could decrease the demand for loans and negatively affect the value of the company s investments and loans 
inflation also generally results in increases in general and administrative expenses 
interest rates normally increase during periods of high inflation and decrease during periods of low inflation 
please refer to risk management above for a discussion of the effects of changes of interest rates on the company s operations 
given that almost all of our business is in puerto rico and the united states and given the degree of interrelation between puerto rico s economy and that of the united states  we are particularly exposed to downturns in the united states economy 
dramatic declines in the united states housing market over the past few years  with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures  unemployment and under employment  have negatively impacted the performance of mortgage loans and resulted in significant write downs of asset values by financial institutions 
the united states and other countries recently faced a severe economic crisis  including a major recession 
these adverse economic conditions have negatively affected  and are likely to continue to negatively affect for some time  the company s assets  including its loans and securities portfolios  capital levels  results of operations and financial condition 
in response to the economic crisis  the united states and other governments established a variety of programs and policies designed to mitigate the effects of the crisis 
these programs and policies appear to have stabilized the severe financial crisis that occurred in the second half of  but the extent to which these programs and policies will assist in a continued economic recovery or may lead to adverse consequences  whether anticipated or unanticipated  is still unclear

any increase in the severity or duration of adverse economic conditions would adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s business activities and credit exposure are concentrated in puerto rico 
consequently  its financial condition and results of operations are highly dependent on economic conditions in puerto rico 
puerto rico s economy entered into a recession that began in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year that ended june   a fiscal year in which the real gross national product grew by only 
for fiscal years    and  puerto rico s real gross national product decreased by    and  respectively 
according to the puerto rico planning board s latest projections made in april  real gross national product for fiscal years and was expected to increase by and  respectively 
in connection with government transition process hearings held during november  the puerto rico planning board reduced these projections to increases of the real gross national product of and in fiscal years and  respectively 
since  puerto rico has faced a number of fiscal challenges  including an imbalance between its general fund total revenues and expenditures 
the imbalance reached its highest level in fiscal year  when the deficit was approximately billion 
in january  the previous puerto rico government administration developed and commenced implementing a multi year plan designed to achieve fiscal balance  restore sustainable economic growth and safeguard the investment grade ratings of puerto rico bonds 
the plan included certain expense reduction measures that  together with various temporary and permanent revenue raising measures  have allowed the puerto rico government to reduce its deficit during the last three fiscal years by both increasing its revenues and decreasing its expenditures 
puerto rico s ability to continue reducing the deficit will depend in part on its ability to continue increasing revenues and reducing expenditures  which in turn depends on a number of factors  including improvements in general economic conditions 
one of the challenges every puerto rico administration has faced during the past twenty years is how to address the growing unfunded pension obligations and funding shortfalls of the three government retirements systems that are funded principally with budget appropriations from puerto rico s general fund 
as of june   the date of the latest actuarial valuations of the three retirement systems  the unfunded actuarial accrued liability including basic and system administered benefits for the employees retirement system  the teachers retirement system and judiciary retirement system were billion  billion and million  respectively  and the funded ratios were  and  respectively 
based on current employer and member contributions to the retirement systems  the unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities will continue to increase significantly  with a corresponding decrease in their funded ratios  since the annual contributions are not sufficient to fund pension benefits  and thus  are also insufficient to amortize the unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities 
because annual benefit payments and administrative expenses of the retirement systems have been significantly larger than annual employer and member contributions  the retirement systems have been forced to use investment income  borrowings and sale of investment portfolio assets to cover funding shortfalls 
the funding shortfall basic system benefits  administrative expenses and debt service in excess of contributions for fiscal year for the employees retirement system  the teachers retirement system and judiciary retirement system were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
for fiscal year  the funding shortfalls were estimated to be million  million and million  respectively 
on february  the new puerto rico government announced a series of measures that are being presented to the puerto rico legislature to reform and stabilize the finances of the employees retirement system 
among other things  the proposed reforms would i extend the retirement age for all public employees covered under such plan  ii move public employees from a defined benefit plan to a hybrid plan that includes accrued benefits under the existing defined benefit plan accrual of benefits under the defined plan would end on june  and new benefits to accrue under a new defined contribution plan  iii increase the contributions made by employees to the plan from to of their compensation  and iv modify certain additional benefits given to retired public employees such as summer and christmas bonuses and contributions for medical plan coverage

index to financial statements the current state of the puerto rico economy and continued uncertainty in the public and private sectors has had an adverse effect on the credit quality of our loan portfolios 
the continuation of the economic slowdown would cause those adverse effects to continue  as delinquency rates may continue to increase in the short term  until sustainable growth of the puerto rico economy resumes 
also  potential reduction in consumer spending as a result of continued recessionary conditions may also impact growth in our other interest and non interest revenue sources 
future growth of the puerto rico economy will depend on several factors including the condition of the united states economy  the relative stability of the price of oil imports  the exchange value of the united states dollar  the level of interest rates  the effectiveness of the recently approved changes to local tax and other legislation  and the continuing economic uncertainty generated by the puerto rico government s fiscal condition and the funding deficiencies of the puerto rico government retirement systems described above
